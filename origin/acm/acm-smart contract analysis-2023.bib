abstract = {Blockchain technologies have found important and concrete applications in the real world. Active solutions leverage Smart Contracts for the management of cryptocurrencies, sensitive data, and other valuable assets. One of the core objectives of blockchain-oriented software engineering (BOSE) is ensuring that Smart Contracts receive adequate pre-release testing to guarantee the deployment of reliable code. However, the novelty and the complexity of the blockchain environment pose new challenges to the validation and verification of Smart Contract based software. In this paper, we analyze the aforementioned challenges to foster the discussion on the specific topic of Smart Contract testing and identify relevant research directions.},

abstract = {Smart contracts are gaining popularity as a means to support transparent, traceable, and self-executing decentralized applications, which enable the exchange of value in a trustless environment. Developers of smart contracts rely on various libraries, such as OpenZeppelin for Solidity contracts, to improve application quality and reduce development costs. The API documentations of these libraries are important sources of information for developers who are unfamiliar with the APIs. Yet, maintaining high-quality documentations is non-trivial, and errors in documentations may place barriers for developers to learn the correct usages of APIs. In this paper, we propose a technique, DocCon, to detect inconsistencies between documentations and the corresponding code for Solidity smart contract libraries. Our fact-based approach allows inconsistencies of different severity levels to be queried, from a database containing precomputed facts about the API code and documentations. DocCon successfully detected high-priority API documentation errors in popular smart contract libraries, including mismatching parameters, missing requirements, outdated descriptions, etc. Our experiment result shows that DocCon achieves good precision and is applicable to different libraries: 29 and 22 out of our reported 40 errors have been confirmed and fixed by library developers so far.},

abstract = {Smart contracts have obtained much attention and are crucial for automatic financial and business transactions. For end-users who have never seen the source code, they can read the user notice shown in end-user client to understand what a transaction does of a smart contract function. However, due to time constraints or lack of motivation, user notice is often missing during the development of smart contracts. For end-users who lack the information of the user notices, there is no easy way for them to check the code semantics of the smart contracts. Thus, in this paper, we propose a new approach SmartDoc to generate user notice for smart contract functions automatically. Our tool can help end-users better understand the smart contract and aware of the financial risks, improving the users' confidence on the reliability of the smart contracts. SmartDoc exploits the Transformer to learn the representation of source code and generates natural language descriptions from the learned representation. We also integrate the Pointer mechanism to copy words from the input source code instead of generating words during the prediction process. We extract 7,878 {function, notice) pairs from 54,739 smart contracts written in Solidity. Due to the limited amount of collected smart contract functions (i.e., 7,878 functions), we exploit a transfer learning technique to utilize the learned knowledge to improve the performance of SmartDoc. The learned knowledge obtained by the pre-training on a corpus of Java code, that has similar characteristics as Solidity code. The experimental results show that our approach can effectively generate user notice given the source code and significantly outperform the state-of-the-art approaches. To investigate human perspectives on our generated user notice, we also conduct a human evaluation and ask participants to score user notice generated by different approaches. Results show that SmartDoc outperforms baselines from three aspects, naturalness, informativeness, and similarity.},

abstract = {The ongoing public interest in blockchains and smart contracts has brought a rise to a magnitude of different blockchain implementations. The rate at which new concepts are envisioned and implemented makes it hard to vet their impact on security. Especially smart contract platforms, executing untrusted code, are very complex by design. Still, people put their trust and money into chains that may lack proper testing. A behavior deviation for edge cases of single op-codes is a critical bug class in this brave new world. It can be abused for Denial of Service against the blockchain, chain splits, double-spending, or direct attacks on applications operating on the blockchain. In this paper, we propose an automated methodology to uncover such differences. Through coverage-guided and state-guided fuzzing, we explore smart contract virtual machine behavior against multiple VMs in parallel. We develop NeoDiff, the first framework for feedback-guided differential fuzzing of smart contract VMs. We discuss real, monetary consequences our tool prevents. NeoDiff can be ported to new smart contract platforms with ease. Apart from fuzzing Ethereum VMs, NeoDiff found a range of critical differentials in VMs for the Neo blockchain. Moreover, through a higher-layer semantics mutator, we uncovered semantic discrepancies between Neo smart contracts written in Python when executed on the blockchain vs. classic CPython. Along the way, NeoDiff uncovered memory corruptions in the C# Neo VM.},

abstract = {We are recently witnessing an exponential use of blockchain technology since information infrastructures are increasingly moving from the concept of centralisation to the decentralization ones. Blockchain technology is strictly related to the exchange of sensitive information, and its massive adoption is corresponding to interest from attackers. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically detect whether a Smart Contract (i.e. a contract between two parties concerning the exchange of goods and services, it is executed automatically and is governed by a source code written by a developer, contains clearly conditions accepted by both parties and resides on a distributed and decentralised network of computers) exhibits vulnerability. The proposed method relies on model checking and, through the adoption of μ-Calculus rules, is aimed to detect four different vulnerabilities on Smart Contracts modeled as automata. We preliminary evaluate the proposed method on a dataset composed by 40 (vulnerable and legitimate) contracts, by obtaining a precision ranging from 0.98 to 1 and a recall equal to 1, confirming that the proposed method can be promising in vulnerable Smart Contract detection.},

abstract = {The skyrocketing market value of cryptocurrencies has prompted more investors to pour funds into cryptocurrencies to seek asset hedging. However, the anonymity of blockchain makes cryptocurrency naturally a tool of choice for criminals to commit smart contract scams. Consequently, smart contract scam detection is particularly critical for investors to avoid economic loss. Previous methods mainly leverage specific code logic of smart contracts and/or design rules based on abnormal transaction behaviors for scam detection. Although these methods gain success at detecting particular scams, they perform worse when applied to scams with highly similar codes. Besides, well-designed decision rules rely on expert knowledge and tedious data collection steps, which causes poor flexibility. To combat these challenges, we consider the problem of smart contract scam detection via mining topological features of account interaction information that dynamically evolves. We adopt interactive features extracted from dynamic interaction information of accounts and propose a framework named TTG-SCSD to utilize the features and Topological Data Analysis for smart contract scams detection. The TTG-SCSD constructs discrete dynamic interaction graphs for each contract and designs interactive features that characterize account behaviors. The features are modeled combined with a topology quantification mechanism to capture contract intentions in transactions. Experimental results on real-world transaction datasets from Ethereum show that TTG-SCSD obtains better generalizability and improves the performance of the bare versions of the comparison methods.},

abstract = {Greybox fuzzers require intermediate programs called fuzz drivers to test smart contract APIs. These fuzz drivers use the semi-random inputs (bytes) generated by fuzzers to prepare suitable inputs required to test APIs. Further, fuzz driver also uses this input to decide sequence in which APIs to be invoked and enables the fuzzer to execute the APIs in that sequence to find the vulnerabilities, if any. Manually writing such complex and intelligent fuzz drivers is laborious, requires deep technical skills, hence can be cumbersome and error prone. In this paper, we propose SmartFuzzDriverGen framework to automatically generate fuzz drivers which invoke smart contract APIs using different strategies: unit-level, sequence-based (random, user-defined), and heuristics based. We evaluate the proposed framework by testing a prototype implementation of it with Golang smart contracts (targeted for Hyperledger Fabric platform) and study the effectiveness of the generated fuzz drivers in terms of code coverage as well as bug finding abilities. We observed that fuzzing of APIs in random sequences performed better than the other methods.},

However, many smart contracts deployed in practice are prone to errors and cannot be modified due to the immutability of the blockchain. In light of this, it is vital to ensure the security of correctness of smart contracts before deployment. This paper proposes a formal modeling method based on Timed Colored Petri net (TCPN) to anlyze smart contracts with time constrains. We apply this formalism to a concrete voting contract system. Its functional requirements are formalized by the improved computing timing logic ASK-CTL with ML (Meta Language). Simulation and experiment show that the security and reliability of the voting contract can be effectively guaranteed.},

Simultaneously, the most typical smart contract systems’ public nature limits the meaning of contracts. Smart contract confidentiality problems are a major impediment to their widespread adoption. A viable technique to protecting sensitive information is to hide it with cryptographic primitives or a hashing algorithm, however, hashing is irreversible, thus to address these issues, we first observed the privacy leakage of public smart contracts in this study. We next introduced our technique for privacy-preserving smart contracts, which includes encrypted user output values and defines holders of private values to prevent unintentional data leakage.},

Because of this, verification and validation of smart contracts is of vital importance. Indeed, it is industrial practice to hire independent specialized companies to audit smart contracts before deployment. Auditors typically rely on a combination of tools and experience but still fail to identify problems in smart contracts before deployment, causing significant losses. In this paper, we propose using predicate abstraction to construct models which can be used by auditors to explore and validate smart contact behaviour at the function call level by proposing predicates that expose different aspects of the contract. We propose predicates based on requires clauses and enum-type state variables as a starting point for contract validation and report on an evaluation on two different benchmarks.},

abstract = {Over the past couple of years, smart contracts have been plagued by multifarious vulnerabilities, which have led to catastrophic financial losses. Their security issues, therefore, have drawn intense attention. As countermeasures, a family of tools has been developed to identify vulnerabilities in smart contracts at the source-code level. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of smart contracts is currently open-sourced. Another spectrum of work is presented to deal with pure bytecode, but most such efforts still suffer from relatively low performance due to the inherent difficulty in restoring abundant semantics in the source code from the bytecode. This paper proposes a novel cross-modality mutual learning framework for enhancing smart contract vulnerability detection on bytecode. Specifically, we engage in two networks, a student network as the primary network and a teacher network as the auxiliary network. takes two modalities, i.e., source code and its corresponding bytecode as inputs, while is fed with only bytecode. By learning from , is trained to infer the missed source code embeddings and combine both modalities to approach precise vulnerability detection. To further facilitate mutual learning between and , we present a cross-modality mutual learning loss and two transfer losses. As a side contribution, we construct and release a labeled smart contract dataset that concerns four types of common vulnerabilities. Experimental results show that our method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract = {The classification of the smart contract can effectively reduce the search space and improve retrieval efficiency. The existing classification methods are based on natural language processing technologies. Because the processing of source code by these technologies lacks extraction and processing in the software engineering field, there is still a lot of room for improvement in their methods of feature extraction. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-feature fusion method for smart contract classification (MFF-SC) based on the code processing technology. From the source code perspective, source code processing method and attention mechanism are used to extract local code features. Structure-based traversal method are used to extract global code features from abstract syntax tree. Local and global code features introduce attention mechanism to generate code semantic features. From the perspective of account transaction, the feature of account transaction is extracted by using TransR. Next, the code semantic features and account transaction features generate smart contract semantic features by an attention mechanism. Finally, the smart contract semantic features are fed into a stacked denoising autoencoder and a softmax classifier for classification. Compared with other baselines and variants, experimental results on a real-world dataset show that MFF-SC achieves an accuracy rate of 83.9%.},

abstract = {Smart contracts are usually financial-related, which makes them attractive attack targets. Many static analysis tools have been developed to facilitate the contract audit process, but not all of them take account of two special features of smart contracts: (1) The external variables, like time, are constrained by real-world factors; (2) The internal variables persist between executions. Since these features import implicit constraints into contracts, they significantly affect the performance of static tools, such as causing errors in reachability analysis and resulting in false positives. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study on implicit constraints from three aspects. First, we summarize the implicit constraints in smart contracts. Second, we evaluate the impact of such constraints on the state-of-the-art static tools. Third, we propose a lightweight but effective mitigation method named ConSym to deal with such constraints and integrate it into OSIRIS. The evaluation result shows that ConSym can filter out 96% of false positives and reduce false negatives by two-thirds.},

abstract = {Smart contracts are tempting targets of attacks, as they often hold and manipulate significant financial assets, are immutable after deployment, and have publicly available source code, with assets estimated in the order of millions of dollars being lost in the past due to vulnerabilities. Formal verification is thus a necessity, but smart contracts challenge the existing highly efficient techniques routinely applied in the symbolic verification of software, due to specificities not present in general programming languages. A common feature of existing works in this area is the attempt to reuse off-the-shelf verification tools designed for general programming languages. This reuse can lead to inefficiency and potentially unsound results, as domain translation is required. In this article, we describe a carefully crafted approach that directly models the central aspects of smart contracts natively, going from the contract to its logical representation without intermediary steps. We use the expressive and highly automatable logic of constrained Horn clauses for modeling and instantiate our approach to the Solidity language. A tool implementing our approach, called Solicitous, was developed and integrated into the SMTChecker module of the Solidity compiler solc. We evaluated our approach on an extensive benchmark set containing 22,446 real-world smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain over a 27-month period. The results show that our approach is able to establish safety of significantly more contracts than comparable, publicly available verification tools, with an order of magnitude increase in the percentage of formally verified contracts.},

abstract = {Symbolic detection has been widely used to detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Unfortunately, as reported, existing symbolic tools cost too much time, since they need to execute all paths to detect vulnerabilities. Thus, their accuracy is limited by time. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose Park, the first general framework of parallel-fork symbolic execution for smart contracts. The main idea is to use multiple processes during symbolic execution, leveraging multiple CPU cores to enhance efficiency. Firstly, we propose a fork-operation based dynamic forking algorithm to achieve parallel symbolic contract execution. Secondly, to address the SMT performance loss problem in parallelization, we propose an adaptive processes restriction and adjustment algorithm. Thirdly, we design a shared-memory based global variable reconstruction method to collect and rebuild the global variables from different processes. We implement Park as a plug-in and apply it to two popular symbolic execution tools for smart contracts: Oyente and Mythril. The experimental results with third-party datasets show that Park-Oyente and Park-Mythril can provide up to 6.84x and 7.06x speedup compared to original tools, respectively.},

abstract = {To create trustworthy programs, the 'gold standard' is specifications at a high-enough level to clearly correspond to the informal specifications, and also a refinement proof linking these high-level specifications down to, in our case, executable bytecode. The DeepSEA system demonstrates how this can be done, in the context of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. A key component of this is the model of the blockchain on which the smart contracts reside. When doing proofs in DeepSEA, it is critical to have such a model, which allows for the writing of specifications at a high-level clearly corresponding to informal specifications. A candidate model for doing so and its usefulness for carrying out proofs is discussed in this paper.},

abstract = {Smart contracts are increasingly used with blockchain systems for high-value applications. It is highly desired to ensure the quality of smart contract source code before they are deployed. This paper proposes a new deep learning-based tool, MANDO-GURU, that aims to accurately detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts at both coarse-grained contract-level and fine-grained line-level. Using a combination of control-flow graphs and call graphs of Solidity code, we design new heterogeneous graph attention neural networks to encode more structural and potentially semantic relations among different types of nodes and edges of such graphs and use the encoded embeddings of the graphs and nodes to detect vulnerabilities. Our validation of real-world smart contract datasets shows that MANDO-GURU can significantly improve many other vulnerability detection techniques by up to 24% in terms of the F1-score at the contract level, depending on vulnerability types. It is the first learning-based tool for Ethereum smart contracts that identify vulnerabilities at the line level and significantly improves the traditional code analysis-based techniques by up to 63.4%. Our tool is publicly available at https://github.com/MANDO-Project/ge-sc-machine. A test version is currently deployed at http://mandoguru.com, and a demo video of our tool is available at http://mandoguru.com/demo-video.},

abstract = {Blockchain technology is becoming increasingly popular, and smart contracts (i.e., programs that run on top of the blockchain) represent a crucial element of this technology. In particular, smart contracts running on Ethereum (i.e., one of the most popular blockchain platforms) are often developed with Solidity, and their deployment and execution consume gas (i.e., a fee compensating the computing resources required). Smart contract development frequently involves code reuse, but poor readable smart contracts could hinder their reuse. However, writing readable smart contracts is challenging, since practices for improving the readability could also be in contrast with optimization strategies for reducing gas consumption. This paper aims at better understanding (i) the readability aspects for which traditional software and smart contracts differ, and (ii) the specific smart contract readability features exhibiting significant relationships with gas consumption. We leverage a set of metrics that previous research has proven correlated with code readability. In particular, we first compare the values of these metrics obtained for both Solidity smart contracts and traditional software systems (written in Java). Then, we investigate the correlations occurring between these metrics and gas consumption and between each pair of metrics. The results of our study highlight that smart contracts usually exhibit lower readability than traditional software for what concerns the number of parentheses, inline comments, and blank lines used. In addition, we found some readability metrics (such as the average length of identifiers and the average number of keywords) that significantly correlate with gas consumption.},

In this context, optimizing gas fees in smart contracts becomes necessary to save costs for both developers and users who interact directly with these contracts. To optimize gas, developers typically need to have deep knowledge of blockchain and programming languages, making it a significant challenge for new programmers. In this paper, we introduce GasSaver - an open-source tool that analyzes Solidity-based contracts and suggests modifications to reduce transaction fees. Our tool, which relies on a set of seven rules for identifying non-optimized codes, shows that 6,333 in a total of 10,245 top most interactive contracts on Ethereum contain at least one optimization problem and the total problems are more than 30,000. Hence, the use of this tool can reduce a considerable cost for the deployment and interaction of smart contracts.},

abstract = {Proof-of-Work~(PoW) based blockchains typically allocate only a tiny fraction (e.g., less than 1% for Ethereum) of the average interarrival time~$mathbbI $ between blocks for validating smart contracts present in transactions. In such systems, block validation and PoW mining are typically performed sequentially, the former by CPUs and the latter by ASICs. A trivial increase in validation time~$(τ)$ introduces the popularly known Verifier's Dilemma, and as we demonstrate, causes more forking and hurts fairness. Large τ also reduces the tolerance for safety against a Byzantine adversary. Solutions that offload validation to a set of non-chain nodes (a.k.a. off-chain approaches) suffer from trust and performance issues that are non-trivial to resolve.In this paper, we present Tuxedo, the first on-chain protocol to theoretically scale τ/mathbbI approx 1$ in PoW blockchains. The key innovation in Tuxedo is to perform CPU-based block processing in em parallel to ASIC mining. We achieve this by allowing miners to delay validation of transactions in a block by up to ζ blocks, where ζ is a system parameter. We perform security analysis of Tuxedo considering all possible adversarial strategies in a synchronous network with maximum end-to-end delay Δ and demonstrate that Tuxedo achieves security equivalent to known results for longest chain PoW Nakamoto consensus. Our prototype implementation of Tuxedo atop Ethereum demonstrates that it can scale τ without suffering the harmful effects of na\"{\i}ve scaling up of τ/mathbbI $ in existing blockchains.},

abstract = {Unlike traditional software, smart contracts have the unique organization in which a sequence of transactions shares persistent states. Unfortunately, such a characteristic makes it difficult for existing fuzzers to find out critical transaction sequences. To tackle this challenge, we employ both static and dynamic analyses for fuzzing smart contracts. First, we statically analyze smart contract bytecodes to predict which transaction sequences will lead to effective testing, and figure out if there is a certain constraint that each transaction should satisfy. Such information is then passed to the fuzzing phase and used to construct an initial seed corpus. During a fuzzing campaign, we perform a lightweight dynamic data-flow analysis to collect data-flow-based feedback to effectively guide fuzzing. We implement our ideas on a practical open-source fuzzer, named Smartian. Smartian can discover bugs in real-world smart contracts without the need for the source code. Our experimental results show that Smartian is more effective than existing state-of-the-art tools in finding known CVEs from real-world contracts. Smartian also outperforms other tools in terms of code coverage.},

Data trading is only possible when a buyer satisfies the conditions predefined by the seller. Geographic location, type or size of buyer's company are some examples of seller preferences. A preferences algorithm provides an automated contract between seller and buyer without the involvement of any broker or third party.

However, most of them cannot be used effectively in a multimedia distribution network (MDN) as they are not designed to support multi-layer watermark embedding. Multi-layer watermarking mechanisms were developed to protect multimedia data across different layers in an MDN. However, in those mechanisms, we need to trust the entities in the MDN, such as regional and country distributors. To overcome this potential drawback, in this article, we propose a novel privacy protection mechanism for MDNs by combining the advantages of both blockchain and watermarking technologies. A specifically designed watermarking algorithm is used to link the copyright information with the audio file, while a novel blockchain-based smart contract mechanism is developed to enforce the proper functioning of each entity in the distribution network. Moreover, the new audio mechanism is computationally efficient. Although audio signals are used to show the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism, the proposed approach can easily be extended to other multimedia objects, such as an image. The validity of the proposed mechanism is demonstrated by our simulation results. The proposed mechanism can benefit multimedia production companies and other entities in the MDN.},

abstract = {Tokens have become an essential part of blockchain ecosystem, so recognizing token transfer behaviors is crucial for applications depending on blockchain. Unfortunately, existing solutions cannot recognize token transfer behaviors accurately and efficiently because of their incomplete patterns and inefficient designs. This work proposes TokenAware, a novel online system for recognizing token transfer behaviors. To improve accuracy, TokenAware infers token transfer behaviors from modifications of internal bookkeeping of a token smart contract for recording the information of token holders (e.g., their addresses and shares). However, recognizing bookkeeping is challenging, because smart contract bytecode does not contain type information. TokenAware overcomes the challenge by first learning the instruction sequences for locating basic types and then deriving the instruction sequences for locating sophisticated types that are composed of basic types. To improve efficiency, TokenAware introduces four optimizations. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate TokenAware with real blockchain data. Results show that TokenAware can automatically identify new types of bookkeeping and recognize 107,202 tokens with 98.7% precision. TokenAware with optimizations merely incurs 4% overhead, which is 1/345 of the overhead led by the counterpart with no optimization. Moreover, we develop an application based on TokenAware to demonstrate how it facilitates malicious behavior detection.},

Currently, the miner-validator architecture based on serial contract execution limits the throughput of smart contract execution to a great extent.

abstract = {With the increasing popularity of blockchain, automatically detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts is becoming a significant problem. Prior research mainly identifies smart contract vulnerabilities without considering the interactions between multiple contracts. Due to the lack of analyzing the fine-grained contextual information during cross-contract invocations, existing approaches often produced a large number of false positives and false negatives. This paper proposes SmartDagger, a new framework for detecting cross-contract vulnerability through static analysis at the bytecode level. SmartDagger integrates a set of novel mechanisms to ensure its effectiveness and efficiency for cross-contract vulnerability detection. Particularly, SmartDagger effectively recovers the contract attribute information from the smart contract bytecode, which is critical for accurately identifying cross-contract vulnerabilities. Besides, instead of performing the typical whole-program analysis which is heavy-weight and time-consuming, SmartDagger selectively analyzes a subset of functions and reuses the data-flow results, which helps to improve its efficiency. Our further evaluation over a manually labelled dataset showed that SmartDagger significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art tools (i.e., Oyente, Slither, Osiris, and Mythril) for detecting cross-contract vulnerabilities. In addition, running SmartDagger over a randomly selected dataset of 250 smart contracts in the real-world, SmartDagger detects 11 cross-contract vulnerabilities, all of which are missed by prior tools.},

abstract = {Smart contracts have been widely and rapidly used to automate financial and business transactions together with blockchains, helping people make agreements while minimizing trusts. With millions of smart contracts deployed on blockchain, various bugs and vulnerabilities in smart contracts have emerged. Following the rapid development of deep learning, many recent studies have used deep learning for vulnerability detection to conduct security checks before deploying smart contracts. These approaches show effective results on detecting whether a smart contract is vulnerable or not whereas their results on locating suspicious statements responsible for the detected vulnerability are still unsatisfactory. To address this problem, we propose a deep learning based two-phase smart contract debugger for reentrancy vulnerability, one of the most severe vulnerabilities, named as ReVulDL: Reentrancy Vulnerability Detection and Localization. ReVulDL integrates the vulnerability detection and localization into a unified debugging pipeline. For the detection phase, given a smart contract, ReVulDL uses a graph-based pre-training model to learn the complex relationships in propagation chains for detecting whether the smart contract contains a reentrancy vulnerability. For the localization phase, if a reentrancy vulnerability is detected, ReVulDL utilizes interpretable machine learning to locate the suspicious statements in smart contract to provide interpretations of the detected vulnerability. Our large-scale empirical study on 47,398 smart contracts shows that ReVulDL achieves promising results in detecting reentrancy vulnerabilities (e.g., outperforming 16 state-of-the-art vulnerability detection approaches) and locating vulnerable statements (e.g., 70.38% of the vulnerable statements are ranked within Top-10).},

Our approach provides a convenient DSL for expressing data type refactorings and employs program synthesis to generate the new version of the contract. We have implemented our approach in a tool called Solidare and demonstrate its capabilities on real-world smart contracts from Etherscan and GasStation.

Automated program repair (APR) techniques aim to reduce developers’ burden of manually fixing bugs by automatically generating patches for a given issue. Existing APR tools for smart contracts focus on mitigating typical smart contract vulnerabilities rather than violations of functional specification. However, in decentralized financial (DeFi) smart contracts, the inconsistency between intended behavior and implementation translates into the deviation from the underlying financial model, resulting in monetary losses for the application and its users. In this work, we propose DeFinery—a technique for automated repair of a smart contract that does not satisfy a user-defined correctness property. To explore a larger set of diverse patches while providing formal correctness guarantees w.r.t. the intended behavior, we combine search-based patch generation with semantic analysis of an original program for inferring its specification. Our experiments in repairing 9 real-world and benchmark smart contracts prove that DeFinery efficiently generates high-quality patches that cannot be found by other existing tools.},

abstract = {In the United States and around the world, gun violence has become a long-standing public safety concern and a security threat, due to violent gun-related crimes, injuries, and fatalities. Although legislators and lawmakers have attempted to mitigate its threats through legislation, research on gun violence confirms the need for a comprehensive approach to gun violence prevention. This entails addressing the problem in as many ways as possible, such as through legislation, new technological advancements, re-engineering supply, and administrative protocols, among others. The research focuses on the technological, supply, and administrative aspects, in which we propose a manner of managing gun-related data efficiently from the point of manufacture/sale, as well as at points of transfers between secondary sellers for the improvement of criminal investigation processes. Making data more readily available with greater integrity will facilitate successful investigations and prosecutions of gun crimes. Currently, there is no single and uniform platform for firearm manufacturers, dealers, and other stakeholders involved in firearm sales, dissemination, management, and investigation. With the help of Blockchain technology, gun registry, ownership, transfers, and, most importantly, investigations, when crimes occur, can all be managed efficiently, breaking the cycle of gun violence. The identification of guns, gun tracing, and identification of gun owners/possessors rely on accuracy, integrity, and consistency in related systems to influence gun crime investigation processes. Blockchain technology, which uses a consensus-based approach to improve processes and transactions, is demonstrated in this study as a way to enhance these procedures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore and demonstrate the utility of Blockchain for gun-related criminal investigations using a design science approach.},

abstract = {Smart contracts deployed on permissionless blockchains, such as Ethereum, are accessible to any user in a trustless environment. Therefore, most smart contract applications implement access control policies to protect their valuable assets from unauthorized accesses. A difficulty in validating the conformance to such policies, i.e., whether the contract implementation adheres to the expected behaviors, is the lack of policy specifications. In this paper, we mine past transactions of a contract to recover a likely access control model, which can then be checked against various information flow policies and identify potential bugs related to user permissions. We implement our role mining and security policy validation in tool SPCon. The experimental evaluation on labeled smart contract role mining benchmark demonstrates that SPCon effectively mines more accurate user roles compared to the state-of-the-art role mining tools. Moreover, the experimental evaluation on real-world smart contract benchmark and access control CVEs indicates SPCon effectively detects potential permission bugs while having better scalability and lower false-positive rate compared to the state-of-the-art security tools, finding 11 previously unknown bugs and detecting six CVEs that no other tool can find.},

abstract = {With the development of decentralized networks, smart contracts, especially those for ERC tokens, are attracting more and more Dapp users to implement their applications. There are some functions in ERC token contracts that only a specific group of accounts could invoke. Among those functions, some even can influence other accounts or the whole system without prior notice or permission. These functions are referred to as contract backdoors. Once exploited by an attacker, they can cause property losses and harm users’ privacy.In this work, we propose Pied-Piper, a hybrid analysis method that integrates datalog analysis and directed fuzzing to detect backdoor threats in Ethereum ERC token contracts. First, datalog analysis is applied to abstract the data structures and identification rules related to the threats for preliminary static detection. Then, directed fuzzing is applied to eliminate false positives caused by the static analysis. We first evaluated Pied-Piper on 200 smart contracts, which are injected with different types of backdoors. It reported all problems without false positives, and none of the injected problems was missed. Then, we applied Pied-Piper on 13,484 real token contracts deployed on Ethereum. Pied-Piper reported 189 confirmed problems, four of which have been assigned unique CVE ids while others are still in the review process. Each contract takes 8.03 seconds for datalog analysis on average, and the fuzzing engine can eliminate the false positives within one minute.},

abstract = {Climate change has negative effects on life on earth as well as the environment and economy. Harmful greenhouse gases, especially CO2, emitted from industrial processes executed by developed countries were identified as the primary reason behind climate change. The world recognized the risk of excessive CO2 emissions, therefore, the United Nations established the Kyoto protocol which aims at reducing the release of CO2 by monetizing its emissions. To achieve its goal, the Kyoto protocol established a carbon emission trading scheme to distribute and trade CO2 allowances among and between emitting participants. However, the carbon emission trading scheme fell short of its goal due to lack of integrity, governance, high intermediary cost and other security and technical issues revealing the need for a solution to elevate the scheme's operations. Meanwhile, blockchian emerged as a revolutionary way to operate business models due to its decentralization, security, traceability, immutability, and privacy. This study proposes an efficient and smart carbon emission trading system utilizing blockchain and smart contract. Our paper proposes a carbon emission trading system using Ethereum blockchain smart contract to automate trading Kyoto units between entities and reduce operations cost. The proposed system performs buyers registration and Kyoto units trading using Ether cryptocurrency for payment without intermediary but rather through smart contract and blockchain. The result is a robust and smart system that inherits blockchain features of trust, immutability, distribution, governance, and transparency.},

abstract = {Smart contracts are programs stored on blockchains to execute transactions. When input constraints or security properties are violated at runtime, the transaction being executed by a smart contract needs to be reverted to avoid undesirable consequences. On Ethereum, the most popular blockchain that supports smart contracts, developers can choose among three transaction-reverting statements (i.e., require, if...revert, and if...throw) to handle anomalous transactions. While these transaction-reverting statements are vital for preventing smart contracts from exhibiting abnormal behaviors or suffering malicious attacks, there is limited understanding of how they are used in practice. In this work, we perform the first empirical study to characterize transaction-reverting statements in Ethereum smart contracts. We measured the prevalence of these statements in 3,866 verified smart contracts from popular dapps and built a taxonomy of their purposes via manually analyzing 557 transaction-reverting statements. We also compared template contracts and their corresponding custom contracts to understand how developers customize the use of transaction-reverting statements. Finally, we analyzed the security impact of transaction-reverting statements by removing them from smart contracts and comparing the mutated contracts against the original ones. Our study led to important findings. For example, we found that transaction-reverting statements are commonly used to perform seven types of authority verifications or validity checks, and missing such statements may compromise the security of smart contracts. We also found that current smart contract security analyzers cannot effectively handle transaction-reverting statements when detecting security vulnerabilities. Our findings can shed light on further research in the broad area of smart contract quality assurance and provide practical guidance to smart contract developers on the appropriate use of transaction-reverting statements.},

abstract = {Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are becoming a standard to represent unique and valuable items, such as a piece of art, a videogame item, or other digital or physical goods, and keep track of their provenance. Thanks to blockchain technology and the power of smart contracts, NFT holders have true ownership over them, because they are the only ones who can transfer them. However, through an attack called sleepminting, an attacker is able to impersonate another person, including an artist, and create NFTs on the artist’s behalf, while still maintaining its possession, leveraging bugs in the code of the smart contract that manages the NFTs. Therefore, the attacker can cheat concerning the provenance of an NFT and then sell the fake NFTs to unaware buyers. In this paper, we propose a study that sheds light on this phenomenon. In particular, we collect over 1.3 million events that are connected to sleepminting and analyse the events under multiple aspects. The study uncovers that, by using the sleepminting attack, some users are able to create fake NFTs of popular brands, and are able to mint them to famous personalities in the NFT field, such as well known artists and collectors.},

abstract = {Static analysis of smart-contracts is becoming more widespread on blockchain platforms. Analyzers rely on techniques like symbolic execution or model checking, but few of them can provide strong soundness properties and guarantee the analysis termination at the same time. As smart-contracts often manipulate economic assets, proving numerical properties beyond the absence of runtime errors is also desirable. Smart-contract execution models differ considerably from mainstream programming languages and vary from one blockchain to another, making state-of-the-art analyses hard to adapt. For instance, smart-contract calls may modify a persistent storage impacting subsequent calls. This makes it difficult for tools to infer invariants %and high-level security properties required to formally ensure the absence of exploitable vulnerabilities. The Michelson smart-contract language, used in the Tezos blockchain, is strongly typed, stack-based, and has a strict execution model leaving few opportunities for implicit runtime errors. We present a work in progress static analyzer for Michelson based on Abstract Interpretation and implemented within MOPSA, a modular static analyzer. Our tool supports the Michelson semantic features, including inner calls to external contracts. It can prove the absence of runtime errors and infer invariants on the persistent storage over an unbounded number of calls. It is also being extended to prove high-level numerical and security properties.},

abstract = {In the past, the term “Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)” was used to refer to a loosely organized network of autonomous entities, such as a corporation, a cooperative, or a non-profit party. Since Ethereum pioneered smart contracts in the blockchain, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) can connect public nodes scattered throughout the network into a virtual machine to execute Turing-complete programs. The EVM can also run other applications such as decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which is a new type of blcokchain-based organization that uses smart contracts to perform tasks on a distributed scale. The smart contracts have organizational rules and operational logic embedded and automatically execute organizational decisions and proposals making it highly decentralized and more democratic. The DAOs are organizations that are not subject to legal, physical, or economic constraints, as well as the ability to operate outside the control of a single central authority or a single governing body. Because DAO is formed by many smart contract that operate together, which makes it highly decentralized and has a strong democratic system. This paper discusses the pros and cons of DAO, and the potential of DAO in community development, especially in non-profit organizations. It is hope to provide an overall picture of DAO, and the roadmap for future development of DAO on the right track.},

The application scope of smart contracts is predicted to expand beyond crypto-currency in upcoming years, and this emerging technology is likely to play a significant role in other major domains. Smart contracts are usually created using a special purpose programming language. In this paper, we explore an alternative mechanism based on propositional calculus, using multisignature and lock-based boolean variables. Higher order boolean quantifiers have been avoided, and from a security standpoint, the design is deliberately kept Turing-incomplete to guarantee bounded runtime and well-defined termination paths for any valid smart contract (for homogeneous locks, our validation checks run in linear time for best case and quadratic time for worst case). Keeping in mind a widening scope for smart contracts, the applicability of our design is not confined to blockchain transactions, but can be easily integrated into other application domains.},

abstract = {Despite the benefits that the Blockchain technology brings to many application fields, its adoption does not come without challenges. Smart contracts, which are at the core of 2nd generation blockchains, can often be riddled with vulnerabilities that can be exploited to attack the platform and threaten its security. It is therefore crucial for the protection of the designed systems to prove the correctness of the smart contracts to be deployed. Approaches have been proposed to detect generic vulnerabilities like reentrancy, but the results would often include false positives where the detected bug is either non existent or not exploitable. Besides, such approaches do not offer to check contract-specific properties. The work presented in this paper is situated as part of a formal approach that we have proposed in an attempt to bridge this gap. This previously outlined approach is based on the transformation of Solidity smart contracts into Coloured Petri nets, which provides the possibility to verify smart contracts with reference to properties expressed as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulae. Herein we extend our previous work on mainly two levels: first, by taking into account the concept of function calls in the transformation and second, by focusing on the LTL properties that can define the correctness of a smart contract. Such properties can be specific to the control- or data-flow of the contracts being checked. They can also be used to express vulnerabilities as we showcase by proposing LTL formalizations for six vulnerabilities from the literature. We then leverage the capability of the Helena model checker to detect these vulnerabilities while discerning their exploitability, as well as check temporal-based contract-specific properties.},

Various methods attempt to migrate or upgrade a smart contract, but they are mostly manual, error-prone, and applicable only before deployment. Further, they have challenges in extracting the storage state of complex mapping data structures along with their keys. In this work, we present Smartmuv as an automatic source-code-based static analysis tool to analyze and extract the state from the storage-trie of smart contracts. Based on the abstract syntax tree and the control flow graphs of the Solidity source code, the tool analyzes each state variable including mapping types along the inheritance hierarchy. It also provides the upgrade algorithm that initializes the extracted state in the constructor of new smart contract. Smartmuv safely approximates the origin of the keys used in the mapping to extract values and has been able to extract the mapping state of 23,673 smart contracts with 95.7% overall precision. Moreover, we also validate the Smartmuv’s extracted state with the third-party tool Etherscan.},

As development is complex and challenging, a systematic approach is needed to improve the product, services, and process quality. Despite the introduction of techniques, there are still inadequate models for demonstrating the blockchain's internal architecture. Hence, there is a gap when developing the blockchain application, a gap in the modelling environment of a blockchain development application. This paper introduces a new insight into blockchain application development through extended Agent-Oriented Modelling (eAOM). eAOM is a methodology for complex socio-technical system development, and we believe that it can reduce the complexity of implementing the blockchain application. In this paper, the eAOM is used to model a blockchain-based “win a fortune” system, which includes smart contract development. It showcases the feasibility of adopting eAOM to model a blockchain enabling application. A usability survey among the novices has further validated the usability and benefits of eAOM in the blockchain enabling application development.},

Thus, it is crucial and urgent to detect the vulnerabilities of smart contracts. However, existing fuzzers for smart contracts are still inefficient to detect sophisticated vulnerabilities that require specific vulnerable transaction sequences to trigger. To address this challenge, we propose a novel vulnerability-guided fuzzer based on reinforcement learning, namely RLF, for generating vulnerable transaction sequences to detect such sophisticated vulnerabilities in smart contracts. In particular, we firstly model the process of fuzzing smart contracts as a Markov decision process to construct our reinforcement learning framework. We then creatively design an appropriate reward with consideration of both vulnerability and code coverage so that it can effectively guide our fuzzer to generate specific transaction sequences to reveal vulnerabilities, especially for the vulnerabilities related to multiple functions. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate RLF’s performance. The experimental results demonstrate that our RLF outperforms state-of-the-art vulnerability-detection tools (e.g., detecting 8%-69% more vulnerabilities within 30 minutes).},

abstract = {Subrogation in insurance is the legal right that an insurance company holds to recover the amount paid to the insured from the at-fault party. As of now, subrogation is a relatively manual, laborious, and time-consuming process, requiring many physical checks and much communication between the insurance companies. Moreover, the involvement of multiple stakeholders in the process leads to a high administration cost and a long delay in processing the claims. This even increases when multiple claimants or third parties are involved. Although there are several blockchain-based proposals for general insurance, the topic of subrogation is still untouched. This paper introduces a novel blockchain-based solution to the subrogation process in the auto-insurance industry. We consider all existing stakeholders, including the insured, adjuster, lawyer, agency, and special investigation unit (SIU), and we design smart contracts aimed at making the subrogation process more efficient, transparent, and secure. The use of blockchain saves a lot of unnecessary expenditure, time, and manual labor, facilitating easy data-sharing while reducing the possibility of human errors. Moreover, the absence of centralized authority eliminates any fraudulent activities and thus increases trust in the system. To the best of our knowledge, this proposal is the first of its kind using blockchain technology. It will cover a broader perspective of insurance subrogation, bringing all associated stakeholders under the same platform.},

abstract = {Hacks on blockchains are prevalent nowadays because a wide range of vulnerabilities exists in smart contracts. To deal with the vulnerabilities, security auditing has been emerging and widely adopted for manual code inspection. However, little is known about how manual security auditing impacts the blockchain community. In this work, we investigated security audits on blockchain by answering three research questions covering the type, severity, and resolve status of issues in the audit reports. We in total collected 2,421 security audit reports consisting of the details of 28,782 security issues. We found that manual security auditing has superior merit over static analysis tools in identifying logic-related issues, considering 27.65% of all findings are logical issues. We also found that 87.28% of 2,421 projects have at least one centralization issue that breaks the decentralization primitive of blockchain. Moreover, while 21.17% of issues are of major or critical severity, we surprisingly found that 61.83% of all issues were unresolved or partially resolved. We concluded that while manual security auditing can help identify security vulnerabilities uniquely, project developers need to take serious actions to address and secure their smart contracts.},

In the past, the difficulty of collecting open-source EOSIO smart contracts and analyzing WebAssembly (Wasm) bytecode compiled by EOSIO smart contracts, making few researchers proposed static analysis tools for EOSIO smart contracts, and tools capable of dataflow analysis have not yet appeared. In this work, we first propose a dataflow analysis method for EOSIO smart contracts. Based on Octopus, we designed an efficient dataflow analysis method, which can generate Static Single Assignment (SSA) form intermediate representation (IR) for the objective function and its variables to obtain the results of dataflow. We further proved the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments on our collected data sets.},

Data scientists have no access to the loan data of the traditional banking system due to trade secrecy and client privacy reasons. Also, banks’ operation is well regulated. Modern DeFi loan data is openly available in public blockchains the corresponding projects operate in. But the problem is to represent DeFi’s conveniently for analysis. At the same time, DeFis are unregulated. In the paper, we consider a decentralized Ethereum protocol to lend and borrow assets called Compound. We design a relational database, fill it with the project’s data, and provide statistical details. The results help overcome the entering threshold for further data analysis.},

abstract = {Hyperledger Fabric is another development of blockchain technology after Ethereum, which is more suitable as an operating platform for smart contracts. However, the testing technology of Hyperledger Fabric smart contracts (also known as chaincode) is not yet mature currently. Based on this, this paper studies the vulnerability detection of Golang chaincodes. Firstly, we summarize 17 kinds of Golang chaincode vulnerabilities by investigating existing research. Secondly, taking the high accuracy of dynamic detection and the high efficiency of static detection into consideration, we propose a chaincode vulnerability detection framework that combines the dynamic symbolic execution and the static abstract syntax tree analysis technology. We also implement a supporting-tool that can detect the above 15 types of vulnerabilities. Finally, we test the tool by 15 chaincodes collected from GitHub and unknown vulnerabilities were detected in 13 projects. The precision turned out to be 91% after manual inspection. In order to verify the recall rate, we manually inject 30 vulnerabilities into the collected chaincodes and all of them are detected. The evaluation results show the accuracy of the proposed vulnerability detection method for Hyperledger Fabric smart contracts.},

Telemedicine with telecommunication technology offers convenience and cheaper cost, but still is vulnerable to cyber attacks, making it a threat for patients’ data's privacy. One approach that can be used to secure the data is applying access control to the data. Immutable blockchain can helps to enforce access control so it cannot be violated. We propose a system which implements Ethereum for the blockchain and React web application for the interface of the system. Data management and the access control are provided through Ethereum smart contracts, and the access control requires different role-based permission to upload and access the patients’ data. The system works successfully with average time taken to verify the role is 1.8033 seconds per session. The privacy of the patients’ data is ensured because only the patients that are allowed to keep the ID of their own data.},

The recent emergence of blockchain with IoT provides significant growth in the healthcare industry to improve security, privacy, efficiency, and transparency with more business opportunities. Nevertheless, conventional healthcare schemes suffer from various security attacks like collusion, phishing, masquerade, etc. Therefore, a privacy-preserving Distributed Application (DA) is proposed in this paper using blockchain technology to create and maintain healthcare certificates. Here, the distributed application provides an interface between the blockchain network and system objects like healthcare centers, verifiers, and regular authorities to generate and issue medical documents. In addition, it also ensures security by specifying rules using various smart contracts. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, various experimental tests are conducted using the Etherscan tool for measuring operation cost, latency, and processing time. Here, the efficiency of the proposed system is also compared to the existing systems in terms of latency, throughput, and response time. The experimental results and comparative analysis show that the proposed work is more efficient than the existing techniques.},

abstract = {Garg et&nbsp;al. (TCC 2018) defined the notion of registration-based encryption (RBE) where the private key generator (PKG) is decoupled from key management and replaced by a key curator (KC). KC does not possess any cryptographic secrets and only plays the role of aggregating the public keys of all the registered users and updating the public parameters whenever a new user joins the system, which solves the key escrow issue. Notwithstanding, RBE still places a significant amount of trust in KC, whose actions are not accountable, e.g., it could secretly register multiple keys for already registered users. In this article, we propose a blockchain-based RBE framework, which provides total transparency and decentralization of KC by leveraging smart contracts. Our framework transfers the right of key management from KC to individual participants and keeps publicly upgradable parameters on-chain. We provide a basic construction that calculates the public parameter on-chain and an extended construction with better efficiency, which merely calculates the roots of trees on-chain. Our basic version is theoretically feasible, while the extended version is practically feasible. In particular, the enhanced scheme reduces computing complexity to a constant level. Our prototype implementation and evaluation results demonstrate that our extended construction is satisfactorily efficient.},

abstract = {Without relying on centralized intermediaries to participate in financial services such as exchanging and lending assets, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has set off a new paradigm of asset self-management. On the other hand, data as an emerging asset becomes increasingly significant in our daily life. How to self-manage our data assets to raise their value deserves further exploration. Inspired by DeFi, we envision a decentralized eco-system/community where people can donate or trade data end-to-end for the public good and/or maximize data value. This paper explores this vision by building a DeFi-based data sharing and trading system. In order to explore the actual value of data in the market, we propose an elastic data pricing scheme that can dynamically adjust data prices based on data usage and timing. Finally, we implement and integrate these critical components into a prototyping system deployed onto Ethereum - the current leading blockchain system, and evaluate the system service performance, smart contracts functionality, and the robustness of the data pricing scheme.},

abstract = {Ponzi schemes are financial scams that lure users under the promise of high profits. With the prosperity of Bitcoin and blockchain technologies, there has been growing anecdotal evidence that this classic fraud has emerged in the blockchain ecosystem. Existing studies have proposed machine-learning based approaches for detecting Ponzi schemes. However, these state-of-the-art approaches face several major limitations, including lacking interpretability, high false positive rates and the weak robustness to evasion techniques, These limitations mean that existing real-world methods for detecting Ponzi schemes are ineffective.In this paper, we propose SADPonzi, a semantic-aware detection approach for identifying Ponzi schemes in Ethereum smart contracts. Specifically, we propose a heuristic-guided symbolic execution technique to identify investor-related transfer behaviors and the distribution strategies adopted. Experimental result on a well-labelled benchmark suggests that SADPonzi can achieve 100% precision and recall, outperforming all existing machine-learning based techniques. We further apply SADPonzi to all 3.4 million smart contracts deployed by EOAs in Ethereum and identify 835 Ponzi scheme contracts, with over 17 million US Dollars invested by victims. Our observations confirm the urgency of identifying and mitigating Ponzi schemes in the blockchain ecosystem.},

abstract = {The development of the Internet has revolutionized the news industry. While bringing various advantages, it has also caused an overflow of fake and malicious news, which has damaged social and economic benefits. In recent years, new news detection schemes are constantly proposed. In the scheme based on artificial detection, blockchain has become an important infrastructure and tool. Because blockchain is open, transparent, tamper-resistant, and traceable, it has important use value in the scenario of artificial detection, which requires the consensus of multiple entities. However, most of the current blockchain-based solutions focus on ex-ante detection, and they do not implement fine-grained detection division. Obviously, one validator cannot detect the authenticity of all types of news, which leads to a reduction in the credibility of the detection results. In this paper, we propose a framework for news full lifecycle management. First, the news is matched with the professional validators through a fine-grained detection control strategy. Then, based on sealed bid auction and secret sharing technology, a Six-stage Submission Protocol is proposed, which places the validator's consensus process off-chain, saving transaction costs and ensuring the credibility of the detection results. We analyzed the cost and performance of the proposed framework, and the results proved its correctness and feasibility.},

To address the issue, we describe an architecture of distributed oracle protocol in time-sensitive scenario. Then we propose a new protocol which satisfies all requirements defined in the architecture by applying timed commitment scheme.

abstract = {Securing and managing medical data in hospitals is one of the significant challenges still existing in healthcare. There can be different kinds of patients staying in hospitals with various diseases. All these medical data records need to be secured appropriately for future use and verification. In the hospital, there will be essential documents such as criminal cases and postmortem reports, although it is unclear if they are being handled properly or not. Even the hospital staff can alter these data. This paper proposes a blockchain-based secured medical data management system to manage access to each medical record in a network of hospitals. The proposed system has three main access management categories: one for securing general (fever or cold) medical report, category 2 for postmortem or crime reports security and category 3 for securing cancer /brain death /genetic disorder reports. Sensitive clinical data should not be visible to patients with cancer or genetic disorders as these patients have a higher rate of suicide attempts. Hence, the data is accessible only to doctors, family members, and researchers. The data related to the crime or postmortem reports have only limited access for those with legal permission to access and verify these types of reports. So through blockchain distributed ledger technology and smart contracts, we could store the data in a tamper-proof manner and manage the user access to these data.},

This prototype records certificates in a private non-monetary blockchain network, and is provided as an open source project. Countries like Ecuador, Turkey, Uruguay, and Finland can share certificates from the SELI platform through local nodes.

The more gas used indicates a higher transaction fee. In my doctoral research, we aim to investigate two widely studied issues regarding gas, i.e., gas estimation and gas optimization. The former is to predict gas costs for executing a transactions to avoid out-of-gas exceptions, and the latter is to modify existing contracts to save transaction fee. We target some problems that previous work did not solve: gas estimation for loop functions, and gas optimization for storage usage and arrays. We expect that my research can help Ethereum users avoid economical loss for out-of-gas exceptions and pay less transaction fee.},

The efficiency of the supply chain in dealing with the huge volumes of data plays a key role in the overall performance of businesses. Supply Chain Finance (SCF) aims to improve the robustness and efficiency of companies’ supply lines. However, SCF suffers from problems like fraudulent transactions, information inconsistencies, and delays in financial transfers. Decentralized finance (Defi) is a new blockchain paradigm that tackles traditional finance problems. This paper proposes a Defi-based model on a hybrid private-public blockchain for SCF. Our model improves the efficiency of SCF by eliminating costs of using centralized financial institutions, reducing overload costs due to better estimation of the required amount of products, and also decreasing supply delays for the requested products. We also evaluated our model using the SWOT technique for adopting it in the supply chain.},

abstract = {Healthcare systems based on the Internet of Things have an increasing demand for health sensing technology. To manage the data collected and sampled by medical devices, traditional centralized data management will lead to attacks such as single point of failure, which pose a security threat. Aiming at the problems of low data trust and uncontrolled data sharing in telemedicine, we proposed blockchain-based secure medical data management and disease prediction. To securely manage healthcare data, we carefully designed three-tier architecture. Specifically, in the user sensor layer, medical sensors monitor the patient status in real-time. In the storage layer, to protect the privacy of patients, we stored their data in blocks and quantified the medical data by using information entropy technology. In addition, in the blockchain layer, we also used smart contracts for application, authorization, and access control of health data to eliminate privacy leaks caused by internal and external security risks. The information summary is recorded on the blockchain to ensure the integrity of backtracking and anti-repudiation. We designed an extensible machine learning algorithm to predict disease types using a disease prediction model algorithm based on transfer learning. Security analysis and numerical results showed that the proposed scheme can effectively manage the safety data of telemedicine and predict the patient's future condition.},

Since Facebook announced the development of the Metaverse, its related applications and services have instantly become hot issues. Although it may take a few years for the Metaverse to become popular as a social platform today, its impact on future community development will be significant. On the other hand, since Ethereum pioneered smart contracts in the blockchain, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) can connect public nodes scattered throughout the network into a virtual machine to execute Turing-complete programs, and the issue of decentralization has gradually spread. Today, as the application of smart contracts becomes more and more extensive and innovative, such as the decentralized architecture and applications of NFT, DeFi, GameFi, DApp, DAO, DEX, its influence has gradually expanded from the virtual world to physical applications, and also has impacts on real financial applications. The recent burst of NFT and DeFi addressed this issue. There are some gaps between reality and hype, and it is a lesson just like e-commerce burst some 20 years ago. A well format regulation and supervision seem required. However, the challenge for financial supervision today is the decentralized application and anonymity. This paper discusses the innovations in communities that related to decentralized financial services in the blockchain. And the blockchain financial supervision issues that within the tolerable range of risk and impact to both virtual and real world.},

abstract = {Because of lightweight, large-scale and dynamic access characteristics in IoT devices, the current centralized access control mechanism leads to many security problems such as failure of single point, privacy leakage and user authentication. With the advent of blockchain technology, it could be a better way to address these problems by decentralized, transparent and immutability properties of blockchain. Thus, a blockchain-based access control mechanism for IOT is proposed based on the ABAC access control model. Firstly, the model architecture and access control workflow are developed in detail, and the data format of transactions in the blockchain is defined so as to facilitate the release, update, and revocation of attributes and policies. And then, the smart contracts on chain are programed to ensure that the conditions they set on access and sharing will be enforced. Finally, experimental simulation demonstrates that the proposed scheme is efficient in policy-making and policy-querying. At the same time, the use of decentralized ABAC makes it much secure for decision-makers to control variables that ensure a fine-grained approach to access control.},

abstract = {The blockchain technology has been gaining an increasing popularity for the last years, and smart contracts are being used for a growing number of applications in several scenarios. The execution of smart contracts on public blockchains can be invoked by any user with a transaction, although in many scenarios there would be the need for restricting the right of executing smart contracts only to a restricted set of users. To help deal with this issue, this article proposes a system based on a popular access control framework called RT, Role-based Trust Management, to regulate smart contracts execution rights. The proposed system, called Layer 2 DecentrAlized Role-based Trust management (L2DART), implements the RT framework on a public blockchain, and it is designed as a layer-2 technology that involves both on-chain and off-chain functionalities to reduce the blockchain costs while keeping blockchain auditability, i.e., immutability and transparency. The on-chain costs of L2DART have been evaluated on Ethereum and compared with a previous solution implementing on-chain all the functionalities. The results show that the on-chain costs of L2DART are relatively low, making the system deployable in real-world scenarios.},

In this case, the electronic portfolio is designed as a promising tool for professionals and employers, in assessing and presenting guidance for further learning in the workplace environment. However, the implementation of electronic portfolios faces huge challenges, especially due to the lack of interoperability to collect and share competition evidence among multiple organizations and institutions. The growing trend of professional (learning) interoperability has brought other challenges that must be addressed in order to fully utilize the potential of the electronic product portfolio in the context of the fourth industry. This article proposes a framework taking the benefits of blockchain, decentralized storage systems, smart contracts and session management in achieving professional-centric interoperability while creating electronic portfolio and share evidences among multiple organizations without giving up the confidentiality, integrity and availability of shared evidence. The simulation of the proposed model for proof of concept on Ethereum proved its viability in real world practice. In expansion, the assessment of the proposed model proved its effectiveness in terms of cost, storage space and security as a possible solution in electronic portfolios implementation and assisting professionals to stay competitive in global labor market.},

To enable developers discover vulnerabilities in smart contracts, several static analysis tools have been proposed. However, despite the numerous bug-finding tools, security vulnerabilities abound in smart contracts, and developers rely on finding vulnerabilities manually. Our goal in this dissertation study is to expand the space of security vulnerabilities detection by proposing effective static analysis approaches for smart contracts. We study the effectiveness of the existing static analysis tools and propose solutions for security vulnerabilities detection relying on analyzing the dependency of the contract code on user inputs that lead to security vulnerabilities. Our results of evaluating static analysis tools show that existing static tools for smart contracts have significant false-negatives and false-positives. Further, the results show that our first vulnerability detection approach achieves a significant improvement in the effectiveness of detecting vulnerabilities compared to the prior work.},

abstract = {Predatory trading bots lurking in Ethereum's mempool present invisible taxation of traders on automated market makers (AMMs). AMM traders specify a slippage tolerance to indicate the maximum price movement they are willing to accept. This way, traders avoid automatic transaction failure in case of small price movements before their trade request executes. However, while a too-small slippage tolerance may lead to trade failures, a too-large slippage tolerance allows predatory trading bots to profit from sandwich attacks. These bots can extract the difference between the slippage tolerance and the actual price movement as profit.In this work, we introduce the sandwich game to analyze sandwich attacks analytically from both the attacker and victim perspectives. Moreover, we provide a simple and highly effective algorithm that traders can use to set the slippage tolerance. We unveil that most broadcasted transactions can avoid sandwich attacks while simultaneously only experiencing a low risk of transaction failure. Thereby, we demonstrate that a constant auto-slippage cannot adjust to varying trade sizes and pool characteristics. Our algorithm outperforms the constant auto-slippage suggested by the biggest AMM, Uniswap, in all performed tests. Specifically, our algorithm repeatedly demonstrates a cost reduction exceeding a factor of 100.},

The technology of 5G’s objective is to link heterogeneous machines and devices with significant improvements high quality of service (QoS), internet bandwidth, and improved system throughput to enable several upright applications. Despite all these benefits that 5G will provide, still, significant issues need to be resolved, such as decentralization, transparency, and risks associated with data interoperability, network privacy, and security vulnerabilities. Modern networks link an enormous number of devices to the Internet, and in this complicated situation, the use of BC and SDN has been effectively advocated to assure security, privacy, and secrecy. This study offers a blockchain-enabled SDN framework for securing transactions that makes use of Software Defined Network (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) to overcome these issues. The proposed framework can address the man-in-the-middle attack between control and data plane in SDN networks. A controller authentication scheme is provided using smart contracts. Smart contracts automatically authenticate the SDN controller to increase the efficiency of controller verification. The communicated data can also be authenticated using smart contracts. The proposed framework can enhance network transparency, data security, and user privacy. Each SDN controller can access verifiable data using the proposed framework.},

The operation of Blockchain applications is still based on ad-hoc solutions that are error-prone, difficult to maintain and evolve, and do not manage their interactions with other infrastructures (e.g., a Cloud backend).This paper proposes KATENA, a framework for the deployment and management of Blockchain applications. In particular, it focuses on applications that are compatible with Ethereum, a popular general-purpose Blockchain technology. KATENA provides i) a metamodel for defining Blockchain applications, ii) a set of processes to automate the deployment and management of defined models, and iii) an implementation of the approach based on TOSCA, a standard language for Infrastructure-as-Code, and xOpera, a TOSCA-compatible orchestrator. To evaluate the approach, we applied KATENA to model and deploy three real-world Blockchain applications, and showed that our solution reduces the amount of code required for their operations up to 82.7%.},

Therefore, having a bug-free smart contract is vital. To ensure a bug-free smart contract, it must be tested thoroughly. However, little is known about how developers test smart contracts in practice. Our study explores 139 open source smart contract projects that are written in Solidity to investigate the state of smart contract testing from three dimensions: (1) the developers working on the tests, (2) the used testing frameworks and testnets and (3) the type of tests that are conducted. We found that mostly core developers of a project are responsible for testing the contracts. Second, developers typically use only functional testing frameworks to test a smart contract, with Truffle being the most popular one. Finally, our results show that functional testing is conducted in most of the studied projects (93%), security testing is only performed in a few projects (9.4%) and traditional performance testing is conducted in none. In addition, we found 34 projects that mentioned or published external audit reports.},

The former is used to dynamically calculate the reputation score of each FL participant. It employs a trust-jointed reputation scheme to balance the weights between trust values of parameters and bid prices. The latter is responsible for initiating FL auction tasks, calculating price rankings, and assigning corresponding token rewards. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the feasibility and performance of the proposed mechanism against the three typical threats. Experimental results indicate that our mechanism can successfully reduce incentive costs while preventing participants from colluding and over-bidding in the data sharing auction.},

abstract = {A key challenge in engineering distributed systems consists in the integration into their development of a decentralised infrastructure allowing the system participants to trust each other. In this article, we face such a challenge by proposing a model-driven methodology and a related framework to support the engineering of trustable and auditable systems. The approach is based on choreography diagrams specified in the Business Process Model and Notation standard, describing the interactions that should occur among the distributed components of systems. We support the whole lifecycle of choreographies, from their modelling to their distributed execution and auditing. The framework, based on blockchain technology, is named ChorChain. More specifically, ChorChain takes as input a BPMN choreography model and automatically translates it into a Solidity smart contract. The smart contract permits us to enforce the interactions among the cooperating components as prescribed by the choreography model. By leveraging on the auditability of blockchain, ChorChain also supports the activity of auditors continuously. In such a way, ChorChain enables auditors to get some degree of assurance on what happens simultaneously with, or shortly after, information disclosure. We assess the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methodology and framework through experiments conducted on the Rinkeby Ethereum Testnet.},

abstract = {Blockchain has introduced new opportunities with the potential to enhance systems and services across diverse application domains. Fundamental characteristics of blockchains such as immutability, decentralisation, transparency and traceability have a profound role in this. However, integration with contemporary systems and among disparate blockchain-based applications is a non-trivial challenge primarily due to differences with respect to platforms, consensus mechanism, and governance. Although this challenge has received some attention from the research community, it requires careful analysis to analyse existing work and ascertain gaps to achieve effective and efficient solution to this challenge. This article presents a thorough systematic review of existing research within blockchain interoperability highlighting significant contributions. Leveraging this analysis, the article presents an internet-inspired framework (Chain-Net) to facilitate interoperability within blockchain-based systems whereby two systems within independent Blockchain networks can securely exchange data with each other. This is achieved by using gateway module at each network. This module is a lightweight node registered by the Blockchain network, equipped with discovery service to lookup a target blockchain, and is responsible for forwarding cross-chain transactions to gateway module at the target blockchain. Gateway module plays a vital role in the Chain-Net model, as it holds a cross-chain transaction in a pending state until a confirmation is received from the target blockchain, thus maintaining the record integrity between the two chains. The article presents our efforts to evaluate the proposed blockchain interoperability framework against success criteria based on our analysis of the blockchain interoperability challenge.},

abstract = {This paper presents DeCon, a declarative programming language for implementing smart contracts and specifying contract-level properties. Driven by the observation that smart contract operations and contract-level properties can be naturally expressed as relational constraints, DeCon models each smart contract as a set of relational tables that store transaction records. This relational representation of smart contracts enables convenient specification of contract properties, facilitates run-time monitoring of potential property violations, and brings clarity to contract debugging via data provenance. Specifically, a DeCon program consists of a set of declarative rules and violation query rules over the relational representation, describing the smart contract implementation and contract-level properties, respectively. We have developed a tool that can compile DeCon programs into executable Solidity programs, with instrumentation for run-time property monitoring. Our case studies demonstrate that DeCon can implement realistic smart contracts such as ERC20 and ERC721 digital tokens. Our evaluation results reveal the marginal overhead of DeCon compared to the open-source reference implementation, incurring 14% median gas overhead for execution, and another 16% median gas overhead for run-time verification.},

abstract = {The blockchain technology, initially created for cryptocurrency, has been re-purposed for recording state transitions of smart contracts — decentralized applications that can be invoked through external transactions. Smart contracts gained popularity and accrued hundreds of billions of dollars in market capitalization in recent years. Unfortunately, like all other computer programs, smart contracts are prone to security vulnerabilities that have incurred multibillion-dollar damages over the past decade. As a result, many automated threat mitigation solutions have been proposed to counter the security issues of smart contracts. These threat mitigation solutions include various tools and methods that are challenging to compare. This survey develops a comprehensive classification taxonomy of smart contract threat mitigation solutions within five orthogonal dimensions: defense modality, core method, targeted contracts, input-output data mapping, and threat model. We classify 133 existing threat mitigation solutions using our taxonomy and confirm that the proposed five dimensions allow us to concisely and accurately describe any smart contract threat mitigation solution. In addition to learning what the threat mitigation solutions do, we also show how these solutions work by synthesizing their actual designs into a set of uniform workflows corresponding to the eight existing defense core methods. We further create an integrated coverage map for the known smart contract vulnerabilities by the existing threat mitigation solutions. Finally, we perform the evidence-based evolutionary analysis, in which we identify trends and future perspectives of threat mitigation in smart contracts and pinpoint major weaknesses of the existing methodologies. For the convenience of smart contract security developers, auditors, users, and researchers, we deploy and maintain a regularly updated comprehensive open-source online registry of threat mitigation solutions, called Security Threat Mitigation (STM) Registry at https://seit.egr.msu.edu/research/stmregistry/.},

This increases the importance of thoroughly testing the behavior and constraints of the smart contract before deployment.

In this tool demo, we introduce SynTest-Solidity, an automated test case generation and fuzzing framework for Solidity. SynTest-Solidity implements various metaheuristic search algorithms, including random search (traditional fuzzing) and genetic algorithms (i.e., NSGA-II, MOSA, and DynaMOSA).

abstract = {The healthcare industry is one of the top priorities for every country, as the government wants to improve the process and provide better services to the public in the health sector. In COVID19, there is a need to immediate response and secured way of storing data due to overwhelming patients admitting to the hospitals. Many stakeholders are involved in the health sector, such as patients, doctors, pharmaceutical companies, laboratories, and hospitals which makes the complete system complex. Security and privacy are the major concern of comprehensive patient-related information accessed by the involved participants. Blockchain technology is capable of ensuring data integrity and privacy with immutable features. The blockchain technology can be implemented in public and private means, but the medical data is sensitive information which cannot be shared to the public. In this paper, the permissioned blockchain is implemented for healthcare sector using Hyperledger Fabric. The Fabric is an open-source platform through which a Smart Contract is developed on the blockchain network. With the help of a smart contract, the secure transaction is performed on the ledger to store the confidential data related to a patient. The data stored in the form of an immutable block ensures the security of health records stored on distributed ledger through a smart contract. With this implementation, the efficient healthcare process is simplified and the transactions with multiple end-users are done securely, leading to transparency and traceability.},

abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) is a promising solution for training using data collected from heterogeneous sources (e.g., mobile devices) while avoiding the transmission of large amounts of raw data and preserving privacy. Current FL approaches operate in an iterative manner by selecting a subset of participants each round, asking them to training using their latest local data over the most recent version of the global model, before collecting these local model updates and aggregating them to form the next iteration of the global model, and so forth until convergence is reached. Unfortunately, existing FL approaches typically select randomly the set of clients to use each round, which can negatively impact the quality of the model trained, as well the training round time due to the straggler problem. Moreover, clients, especially mobile devices with limited resources, should be incentivized to participate as federated learning is essentially a form of crowdsourcing for AI which requires monetization. We argue that the integration of blockchain and smart contract technologies to FL can solve the two aforementioned issues. In this paper, we present FL-MAB (FL- Multi-Auction using Blockchain), a client selection mechanism for FL operating in a smart contract which rewards clients for their participation using cryptocurrencies. FL-MAB employs a multidimensional auction mechanism for selecting users based on the compute and network resources offered by each client, as well as the quality of their local data. This auction is realized in a reliable and auditable manner through a smart contract. This allows FL-MAB to measure the relative contribution of each client by calculating a Shapley value, and allocating rewards accordingly. We have implemented FL-MAB using Solidity and tested on the Ethereum blockchain with various popular datasets. Our results show that FL-MAB outperforms existing baseline schemes by improving accuracy and reducing the no. of FL rounds.},

In this research, we introduce Decentralized Autonomous Citizen Participation Organizations (DACPOs). In a DACPO, data and actions are recorded and autonomously executed in a decentralized way. DACPOs can be used for enabling participative budgeting and thereby provide transparency, decrease the risks of fraud and corruption, and increase citizens’ trust. The viability of DACPOs depends on a number of factors, including a minimum number of citizens who participate. In further research, factors influencing the use of DACPOs for participative budgeting can be further analyzed and tested.},

Specifically, Zapper compiles contracts to an assembly language executed by a non-interactive zero-knowledge processor and hides accessed objects by an oblivious Merkle tree construction.We implemented Zapper on an idealized ledger and evaluated it on realistic applications, showing that it allows generating new transactions within 22 s and verifying them within 0.03 s (excluding the time for consensus). This performance is in line with the smart contract system ZEXE (Bowe et al., 2020), which offers analogous data and identity privacy guarantees but suffers from multiple shortcomings affecting security and usability.},

abstract = {Smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain greatly benefit from cutting-edge analysis techniques and pose significant challenges. A primary challenge is the extremely low-level representation of deployed contracts. We present Elipmoc, a decompiler for the next generation of smart contract analyses. Elipmoc is an evolution of Gigahorse, the top research decompiler, dramatically improving over it and over other state-of-the-art tools, by employing several high-precision techniques and making them scalable. Among these techniques are a new kind of context sensitivity (termed “transactional sensitivity”) that provides a more effective static abstraction of distinct dynamic executions; a path-sensitive (yet scalable, through path merging) algorithm for inference of function arguments and returns; and a fully context sensitive private function reconstruction process. As a result, smart contract security analyses and reverse-engineering tools built on top of Elipmoc achieve high scalability, precision and completeness. Elipmoc improves over all notable past decompilers, including its predecessor, Gigahorse, and the state-of-the-art industrial tool, Panoramix, integrated into the primary Ethereum blockchain explorer, Etherscan. Elipmoc produces decompiled contracts with fully resolved operands at a rate of 99.5% (compared to 62.8% for Gigahorse), and achieves much higher completeness in code decompilation than Panoramix—e.g., up to 67% more coverage of external call statements—while being over 5x faster. Elipmoc has been the enabler for recent (independent) discoveries of several exploitable vulnerabilities on popular protocols, over funds in the many millions of dollars.},

abstract = {Blockchain-based systems have gained immense popularity as enablers of independent asset transfers and smart contract functionality. They have also, since as early as the first Bitcoin blocks, been used for storing arbitrary contents such as texts and images. On-chain data storage functionality is useful for a variety of legitimate use cases. It does, however, also pose a systematic risk. If abused, for example by posting illegal contents on a public blockchain, data storage functionality can lead to legal consequences for operators and users that need to store and distribute the blockchain, thereby threatening the operational availability of entire blockchain ecosystems. In this paper, we develop and apply a cloud-based approach for quickly discovering and classifying content on public blockchains. Our method can be adapted to different blockchain systems and offers insights into content-related usage patterns and potential cases of abuse. We apply our method on the two most prominent public blockchain systems—Bitcoin and Ethereum—and discuss our results. To the best of our knowledge, the presented study is the first to systematically analyze non-financial content stored on the Ethereum blockchain and the first to present a side-by-side comparison between different blockchains in terms of the quality and quantity of stored data.},

abstract = {Ethereum has been attracting lots of attacks, hence there is a pressing need to perform timely investigation and detect more attack instances. However, existing systems suffer from the scalability issue due to the following reasons. First, the tight coupling between malicious contract detection and blockchain data importing makes them infeasible to repeatedly detect different attacks. Second, the coarse-grained archive data makes them inefficient to replay transactions. Third, the separation between malicious contract detection and runtime state recovery consumes lots of storage.In this article, we propose a scalable attack detection framework named EthScope, which overcomes the scalability issue by neatly re-organizing the Ethereum state and efficiently locating suspicious transactions. It leverages the fine-grained state to support the replay of arbitrary transactions and proposes a well-designed schema to optimize the storage consumption. The performance evaluation shows that EthScope can solve the scalability issue, i.e., efficiently performing a large-scale analysis on billions of transactions, and a speedup of around ( text{2,300}times ) when replaying transactions. It also has lower storage consumption compared with existing systems. Further analysis shows that EthScope can help analysts understand attack behaviors and detect more attack instances.},

abstract = {Smart contracts are programs deployed on a blockchain. They are executed for a monetary fee paid in gas—a clear optimization target for smart contract compilers. Because smart contracts are a young, fast-moving field without (manually) fine-tuned compilers, they highly benefit from automated and adaptable approaches, especially as smart contracts are effectively immutable, and as such need a high level of assurance. This makes them an ideal domain for applying formal methods. Super-optimization is a technique to find the best translation of a block of instructions by trying all possible sequences of instructions that produce the same result. We present a framework for super-optimizing smart contracts based on Max-SMT with two main ingredients: (1) a stack functional specification extracted from the basic blocks of a smart contract, which is simplified using rules capturing the semantics of arithmetic, bit-wise, and relational operations, and (2) the synthesis of optimized blocks, which finds—by means of an efficient SMT encoding—basic blocks with minimal gas cost whose stack functional specification is equal (modulo commutativity) to the extracted one.We implemented our framework in the tool syrup&nbsp;2.0. Through large-scale experiments on real-world smart contracts, we analyze performance improvements for different SMT encodings, as well as tradeoffs between quality of optimizations and required optimization time.},

A common type of evaluation method is relying on the third party or a community-based rating. However, this type of method is encountering an issue caused by fake comments posted by adversaries. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based reputation evaluation approach that uses game theory to address the ghost commentator issue. Over the blockchain network, our approach establishes a reputation-based personal credit evaluation system, in which participants' strategies and payoffs are modeled. A smart contract-based deposit incentive mechanism is developed. We have implemented an experimental evaluation to show the evidence to the performance of our approach.},

Moreover, the issues of privacy preserving and resistance of attacks are also not considered. To this end, we propose a hierarchical data sharing and management system for vehicular ad-hoc networks by combining blockchain and trusted execution environments to achieve transparent data transmission and privacy preserving, wherein the consortium blockchain is regarded as the underlying platform, and the trusted execution environments using Intel SGX is leveraged to guarantee the secure execution of smart contract. Finally, the security analysis and performance evaluation are provided to show that our system can perform well in terms of privacy preserving and data sharing efficiency.},

abstract = {Ethereum is one of the most popular platforms for the development of blockchain-powered applications. These applications are known as \DH{}Apps. When engineering \DH{}Apps, developers need to translate requests captured in the front-end of their application into one or more smart contract transactions. Developers need to pay for these transactions and, the more they pay (i.e., the higher the gas price), the faster the transaction is likely to be processed. Developing cost-effective \DH{}Apps is far from trivial, as developers need to optimize the balance between cost (transaction fees) and user experience (transaction processing times). Online services have been developed to provide transaction issuers (e.g., \DH{}App developers) with an estimate of how long transactions will take to be processed given a certain gas price. These estimation services are crucial in the Ethereum domain and several popular wallets such as Metamask rely on them. However, despite their key role, their accuracy has not been empirically investigated so far. In this article, we quantify the transaction processing times in Ethereum, investigate the relationship between processing times and gas prices, and determine the accuracy of state-of-the-practice estimation services. Our results indicate that transactions are processed in a median of 57 seconds and that 90% of the transactions are processed within 8 minutes. We also show that higher gas prices result in faster transaction processing times with diminishing returns. In particular, we observe no practical difference in processing time between expensive and very expensive transactions. With regards to the accuracy of processing time estimation services, we observe that they are equivalent. However, when stratifying transactions by gas prices, we observe that Etherscan’s Gas Tracker is the most accurate estimation service for the very cheap and cheap transactions. EthGasStation’s Gas Price API, in turn, is the most accurate estimation service for regular, expensive, and very expensive transactions. In a post-hoc study, we design a simple linear regression model with only one feature that outperforms the Gas Tracker for very cheap and cheap transactions and that performs as accurately as the EthGasStation model for the remaining categories. Based on our findings, \DH{}App developers can make more informed decisions concerning the choice of the gas price of their application-issued transactions.},

Due to the decentralization and anonymity of Ethereum, Ponzi schemes have been easily deployed and caused significant losses to investors. However, there are still no explainable and effective methods to help investors easily identify Ponzi schemes and validate whether a smart contract is actually a Ponzi scheme. To fill the research gap, we propose PonziLens, a novel visualization approach to help investors achieve early identification of Ponzi schemes by investigating the operation codes of smart contracts. Specifically, we conduct symbolic execution of opcode and extract the control flow for investing and rewarding with critical opcode instructions. Then, an intuitive directed-graph based visualization is proposed to display the investing and rewarding flows and the crucial execution paths, enabling easy identification of Ponzi schemes on Ethereum. Two usage scenarios involving both Ponzi and non-Ponzi schemes demonstrate the effectiveness of PonziLens.},

This paper focuses on understanding the adoption of GasTokens on Ethereum since May of 2020. We first analyze the usage patterns, including the creation, destruction, and holding of GasTokens, then report several price findings related to GasTokens, and compare the fees paid by users submitting transactions that create and destroy GasTokens to the fees paid by all the transactions in the network over different time periods. We characterize the benefits obtained by GasToken transaction senders and report the impact of GasToken creations and destructions on the major mining pools.},

To fix this issue, we propose Acics, an item data consistency auditing scheme in untrusted cloud services for cloud-aided IIoT systems. Acics presents two variants named S-Acics and L-Acics. S-Acics enables industrial participants to audit item data consistency for each item and circularly play the auditing role. L-Acics further enables industrial participants to audit item data consistency for a sampled subset of items while resisting data selection attack via a new separated storage mechanism. Finally, Acics integrates a fair payment mechanism built on smart contract to incentivize the cloud server to provide consistent item data access service for industrial participants. The experiment results show that our solution can audit item data consistency with reasonable cost.},

abstract = {WebAssembly (Wasm) smart contracts have shown growing popularity across blockchains (e.g., EOSIO) recently. Similar to Ethereum smart contracts, Wasm smart contracts suffer from various attacks exploiting their vulnerabilities. Even worse, few developers released the source code of their Wasm smart contracts for security review, raising the bar for uncovering vulnerable contracts. Although a few approaches have been proposed to detect vulnerable Wasm smart contracts, they have several major limitations, e.g., low code coverage, low accuracy and lack of scalability, unable to produce exploit payloads, etc. To fill the gap, in this paper, we design and develop WASAI, a new concolic fuzzer for uncovering vulnerabilities in Wasm smart contract after tackling several challenging issues. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate WASAI, and the results show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. For example, it achieves 2x code coverage than the baselines and surpasses them in detection accuracy, with an F1-measure of 99.2%. Moreover, WASAI can handle complicated contracts (e.g., contracts with obfuscation and sophisticated verification). Applying WASAI to 991 deployed smart contracts in the wild, we find that over 70% of smart contracts are vulnerable. By the time of this study, over 300 vulnerable contracts have not been patched and are still operating on the EOSIO Mainnet. One fake EOS vulnerability reported to the EOSIO ecosystem was recently assigned a CVE identifier (CVE-2022-27134).},

The growing public interest for NFTs in recent years has played a major role in expanding the market size. However, as a result of expansion, massive overload to the Ethereum network occurred, leading to high gas costs for trading NFT assets, which is rather considered a burdensome amount. To overcome this problem, we introduce a NFT trading platform on Hyperledger Fabric with reference to ERC-721 standard of Ethereum. ERC-721 standard is implemented by Hyperledger Fabric chaincode, which is similar to Ethereum smart contract, where all features of the current protocol are implemented. Parallel processing of Hyperledger fabric enables fast NFT trade management with minimal cost since no gas cost is required with Hyperledger Fabric Raft consensus protocol. It is applicable to fields other than the most actively traded works of art. By providing an optimized trading environment, we expect further development of the NFT trading industry.},

We use a public blockchain to play the role of traditional centralized HIT systems, such that the blockchain deals with cryptocurrency payments and acts as a trustworthy judge to resolve disputes between a worker and a requester in a decentralized setting, preventing false-reporting and free-riding. Our approach neither uses expensive cryptographic tools, such as zero-knowledge proofs, nor sends the worker's answers to the blockchain. Compared with prior works, our approach significantly reduces on-chain cost: it only requires O(1) on-chain storage and O(logN) smart contract computation, where N is the question number of a HIT. Additionally, our approach uses known answers or gold standards to determine the worker's answer quality. To motivate the requester to use honest known answers, the requester cannot learn the worker's answers if the answer quality does not meet the requirement. We further provide formal security definitions for our decentralized HIT and prove security of our construction.},

abstract = {Solana is a rapidly-growing high-performance blockchain powered by a Proof of History (PoH) consensus mechanism and a novel stateless programming model that decouples code from data. With parallel execution on the PoH Sealevel runtime (instead of PoW), it achieves 100X-1000X speedups compared to Ethereum in terms of transactions per second. With the new programming model, new constraints (owner, signer, keys, bump seeds) and vulnerabilities (missing checks, overflows, type confusion, etc.) must be carefully verified to ensure the security of Solana smart contracts. This paper proposes VRust, the first automated smart contract vulnerability detection framework for Solana. A key technical novelty is a set of static analysis rules for validating untrustful input accounts that are unique in the Solana programming model. We have developed a total of eight different vulnerability types, and VRust is able to check all of them fully automatically by translating source code into Rust MIR-based inference rules without any code annotations. VRust has been evaluated on over a hundred of Solana projects, and it has revealed 12 previously unknown vulnerabilities, including 3 critical vulnerabilities in the official Solana Programming Library confirmed by core developers.},

The protocol involved in bringing a Client’s message online and getting back a response is thoroughly explained in all its steps and, then discussed on the most important trust and security issues. Finally, we evaluate such a protocol and the whole framework through a series of communication latency tests, an analysis of the Smart Contract usage, and simulations in which buses act as Data Mules. Our results suggest the feasibility of our proposal in a smart territory scenario.},

abstract = {With the rising popularity of Ethereum, there is also an uptick in the number of smart contract based decentralized applications (DApps). Consequently, Ethereum transaction volume is growing steadily over the last few years, but so are the various types of attacks on it. In Ethereum vulnerable smart contracts are always taken advantage of by adversaries. One of the primary ways of exploiting Ethereum with malicious intent is through frontrunning attacks that take advantage of the waiting time of transactions in the pending pool by adjusting the gas price. Attackers willing to execute such attacks constantly monitor the pending transaction pool and try to frontrun transactions. Mitigating such attacks is a critical step for ensuring secure DApp operations in Ethereum. In this paper, we propose a model-based attack detection and prevention scheme. We extract specific features for each transaction and transform each transaction into a feature vector which is then analyzed by a machine learning model to detect if it is a frontrunning attack transaction or not in real time. Extensive experiments on a large dataset of transactions establish the effectiveness of our approach.},

abstract = {Constant function market makers (CFMMs) such as Uniswap, Balancer, and Curve, among many others, make up some of the largest decentralized exchanges on smart contract platforms like Ethereum. As the amount of capital deposited in these protocols has grown, improving capital efficiency for liquidity providers (LPs) has become an increasingly important challenge. One way to improve efficiency is to allow LPs to borrow Ether or USD against their shares in a CFMM protocol. In this note, we investigate the security and capital efficiency of allowing such lending. We provide sufficient conditions for LP borrowing to be at least as secure and capital efficient as direct borrowing in Aave/Compound. Furthermore, we show that the exposure taken by CFMM lenders can be replicated via barrier options, allowing for risks to be hedged. Finally, we show that the payoff of borrowed CFMM LP shares replicates bounded convex payoffs. Combined, these results suggest that CFMM lending is a safe mechanism for improving capital efficiency.},

abstract = {Despite substantial advancements in healthcare systems and management, little progress has been achieved in addressing supply chain constraints such as, inefficient purchasing, ordering, predicting, and administration procedures. Healthcare authorities needs to effectively manage the healthcare supply chain processes not just during pandemics like COVID-19, but also in their everyday operations to guarantee best possible services. Product recalls, product supply shortage monitoring, expiry, and counterfeiting are some of the critical healthcare supply chain operations which must be ensured. Our suggested solution combines blockchain technology and distributed storage to increase transparency, improve stakeholder communication, and shorten product procurement timelines while eliminating crucial disparities and faults. We present a generic framework for the healthcare supply chain, equipped with comprehensive algorithms showing various stakeholder interactions. Our system uses the Ethereum network to link all parties, including the healthcare authority, manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer, and healthcare provider. Remix IDE platform was used to develop and test the smart contract codes. As decentralized storage, we have used the combination of InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Hyperledger Fabric. We have also examined a variety of security issues, provided a cost analysis of the various transactions proposed in our solution while making comparison with similar blockchain-based solutions.},

abstract = {Traditional blockchain system has two problems: poor privacy protection and scalability. The public chain discloses all information, which can be seen by every node. The code of smart contract is clear-text, and the data is also clear-text. Every node in the public chain is untrustworthy, so it is necessary to design a complex consistency protocol, which often leads to poor performance (low TPS), waste of power, or lower overall credibility. TEE can construct a trusted execution environment Enclave (safe house), which is similar to a black box, the outside cannot access the inside, and it can allow the outside to authenticate the inside reliably through remote authentication. This paper focuses on how to integrate Intel SGX and ring signature algorithm into traditional blockchain to realize privacy calculation and transaction. To protect the anonymity of traders and to process trusted privacy calculation under the chain. Through the cooperation between on the chain and off the chain, "calculation" and "settlement" are completely decoupled, thus solving the performance bottleneck and privacy problems of traditional smart contracts.},

abstract = {Multi-organization data sharing is becoming increasing prevalent due to the interconnectivity of systems and the need for collaboration across organizations (e.g., exchange of data in a supply-chain involving multiple upstream and downstream vendors). There are, however, data security concerns due to lack of trust between organizations that may be located in jurisdictions with varying security and privacy legislation and culture (also referred to as a zero trust environment). Hence, in such a zero trust setting, one should introduce strengthened, yet efficient, access control mechanism to facilitate cross-organizational data access and exchange requests. Contemporary access control schemes generally focus on protecting a single objective rather than multiple parties, due to higher security costs. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based access control scheme, designed to facilitate lightweight data sharing among different organizations. Specifically, our approach utilizes the consortium blockchain to establish a trustworthy environment, in which a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model is then deployed using our proposed multi-signature protocol and smart contract methods. Evaluation of our proposed approach is performed on the HyperLedger Fabric consortium blockchain platform using both Caliper and BFT-SMaRT benchmarks, and the findings demonstrate the utility of our approach.},

The migration to DLT is expected to have a negative performance impact, but some DLTs, such as Hyperledger Fabric, are accepted to be much better suited performance-wise to such use cases than others. However, with the somewhat surprising, but ongoing absence of application-level performance benchmarks for DLTs, cross-DLT comparison for "classic" workloads and the evaluation of the performance impact of "blockchainification" is still ill-supported. We present the design and Hyperledger Caliper-based open implementation of a full port of the classic TPC-C benchmark to Hyperledger Fabric, complete with a structured approach for transforming the original database schema to a smart contract data model. Initial measurements about the workload characteristics that will affect the design of large-scale performance evaluations are also included.},

A structure of stakes and bounties aims at producing debates in good faith and if those persist, they must go down to machine-level details, where they can be settled automatically. This combination of economic incentives and an oracle is designed to promote succinct and informative proofs. SPRIG can run autonomously as a smart contract on a blockchain platform, and hence it does not rely on a central trusted institution. We translate SPRIG into a general game-theoretic model and prove that the protocol satisfies two desirable properties: no spamming and monotonicity. We then characterize analytically the equilibrium of a simple two-player specification of the model: this provides important insights into the impact of the protocol’s parameters on the probabilities that it induces type I/II errors. We conclude by discussing the main attacks SPRIG’s designers will need to take into account.},

However, HCI research has so far failed to address them, focusing primarily on Bitcoin and Ethereum. This is problematic as these new blockchains come with an increasingly diverse set of properties that influence the usability of dApps for end-users. For blockchain interface design guidelines to be valuable for practitioners, they need to acknowledge the heterogeneity of blockchains. However, evaluating novel interface concepts across different blockchains is resource-intensive as each blockchain has to be integrated manually, slowing down research. To address this challenge, we propose a system to support interface experimentation for blockchain applications. The system allows researchers and developers to connect interfaces to a unified API simulating different blockchains and facilitates the configuration, distribution, and evaluation of online experiments. A preliminary evaluation showed promising results.},

abstract = {We leverage blockchain technology for drone node authentication in internet of drone things (IoDT). During the authentication procedure, the credentials of drone nodes are examined to remove malicious nodes from the system. In IoDT, drones are responsible for gathering data and transmitting it to cluster heads (CHs) for further processing. The CH collects and organizes data. Due to computational load, their energy levels rapidly deplete. To overcome this problem, we present a low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (R2D) protocol based on distance, degree, and residual energy. R2D is used to replace CHs with normal nodes based on the biggest residual energy, the degree, and the shortest distance from BS. The cost of keeping a big volume of data on the blockchain is high. We employ the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), to address this issue. Moreover, IPFS protects user data using the industry-standard encryption technique AES-128. This standard compares well to other current encryption methods. Using a consensus mechanism based on proof of work requires a high amount of computing resources for transaction verification. The suggested approach leverages a consensus mechanism known as proof of authority (PoA) to address this problem. The results of the simulations indicate that the suggested system model functions effectively and efficiently. A formal security analysis is conducted to assess the smart contract's resistance to attacks.},

abstract = {Inter-domain routing is the cornerstone of the modern Internet, and the security of inter-domain routing is very important to the reliability and security of Internet basic services. However, BGP protocol, as a current standard inter-domain routing protocol, lacks security considerations at the beginning of its design and does not authenticate routing messages. Because the BGP Community attribute is widely used, researchers have found a variety of new routing attacks using the Community attribute. This kind of attack is more covert and flexible, the detection mechanism is difficult to detect its existence, and the current trusted verification scheme can not completely defend against this kind of attack. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a BGP Community attribute authentication scheme based on blockchain. This scheme authenticates the use of BGP Community attributes based on the blockchain smart contract for the first time. Based on the routing source authentication provided by the routing source authentication mechanism, this scheme further puts forward the concept of "the right to know about using". Through the agent authentication mechanism, it can effectively resist a variety of new routing attacks without changing the existing BGP routing protocol.},

abstract = {Energy storage provides an effective way of shifting temporal energy demands and supplies, which enables significant cost reduction under time-of-use energy pricing plans. Despite its promising benefits, the cost of present energy storage remains expensive, presenting a major obstacle to practical deployment. A more viable solution to improve the cost-effectiveness is by sharing energy storage, such as community sharing, cloud energy storage and peer-to-peer sharing. However, revealing private energy demand data to an external energy storage operator may compromise user privacy, and is susceptible to data misuses and breaches. In this paper, we explore a novel approach to support energy storage sharing with privacy protection, based on privacy-preserving blockchain and secure multi-party computation. We present an integrated solution to enable privacy-preserving energy storage sharing, such that energy storage service scheduling and cost-sharing can be attained without the knowledge of individual users' demands. It also supports auditing and verification by the grid operator via blockchain. Furthermore, our privacy-preserving solution can safeguard against a majority of dishonest users, who may collude in cheating, without requiring a trusted third-party. We implemented our solution as a smart contract on real-world Ethereum blockchain platform, and provided empirical evaluation in this paper1.},

abstract = {Retail energy markets are increasingly consumer-oriented, thanks to a growing number of energy plans offered by a plethora of energy suppliers, retailers and intermediaries. To maximize the benefits of competitive retail energy markets, group purchasing is an emerging paradigm that aggregates consumers' purchasing power by coordinating switch decisions to specific energy providers for discounted energy plans. Traditionally, group purchasing is mediated by a trusted third-party, which suffers from the lack of privacy and transparency. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm of decentralized privacy-preserving group purchasing, empowered by privacy-preserving blockchain and secure multi-party computation, to enable users to form a coalition for coordinated switch decisions in a decentralized manner, without a trusted third-party. The coordinated switch decisions are determined by a competitive online algorithm, based on users' private consumption data and current energy plan tariffs. Remarkably, no private user consumption data will be revealed to others in the online decision-making process, which is carried out in a transparently verifiable manner to eliminate frauds from dishonest users and supports fair mutual compensations by sharing the switching costs to incentivize group purchasing. We implemented our decentralized group purchasing solution as a smart contract on Solidity-supported blockchain platform (e.g., Ethereum), and provide extensive empirical evaluation.},

abstract = {In this study, a higher level of security was implemented by using InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) based peer-to-peer data storage on an Ethereum blockchain. IPFS is used as an image data storage medium that generates an IPFS hash, or known as content identifier (CID). The CID is used to access image data on the IPFS, which can be done with the help of an IPFS gateway. The CID is sent into the blockchain using a smart contract. The results of the study demonstrates that the use of IPFS as additional security on a blockchain system can be done. The size of file sent using IPFS proportionally affects the time it takes for IPFS to store the file. The larger the file size, the more time it will take. For each additional 1&nbsp;MB file, there is an approximately 5% increase in access time. The distance from the IPFS gateway will also affect file access times in which, the farther the IPFS gateway, the more time it takes. If the IPFS gateway is at a distance of 1,000&nbsp;km, there will be a decrease in access time of about 5%. The distance between the IPFS gateway and the accessor also affects success with accessing data. For the most distant gateway, i.e. the United States, there was even an access failure of 24%.},

However, poor audio/video quality resulting from unstable Internet connections undermines the productivity of important tasks. Additionally, the static monetization model for ISP networks, which employs third parties, cannot support on-demand and dynamic Quality-of-Service sessions that are necessary to maximize the Quality-of-Experience of video conferencing. To address this, we introduce BlockQoS: Fair Monetization of On-Demand Quality-of-Service using Blockchains. BlockQoS allows clients to request and manage their Quality-of-Service requirements through a blockchain-based platform operating using a smart contract. It implements a decentralized monetization model to eliminate third parties, enforce transparency in service level agreements, and reduce blockchain operating costs by utilizing off-chain billing validated using zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARK). Additionally, we propose a Quality-of-Service delivery verification mechanism that enforces service level agreements on the hardware external to the blockchain, and a dynamic evaluation method based on the concept of Nash equilibrium in game theory that prevents malicious behavior by ISPs and users. We implemented BlockQoS over Ethereum with a Ryu controller, zk-SNARK, and SGX. Our experiments show that BlockQoS offers transaction cost reduction of up to 88% (gas cost) and latency reduction of up to 87% compared to the state-of-the-art on-chain solutions.},

abstract = {Traditional public blockchain systems typically had very limited transaction throughput because of the bottleneck of the consensus protocol itself. With recent advances in consensus technology, the performance limit has been greatly lifted, typically to thousands of transactions per second. With this, transaction execution has become a new performance bottleneck. Exploiting parallelism in transaction execution is a clear and direct way to address this and to further increase transaction throughput. Although some recent literature introduced concurrency control mechanisms to execute smart contract transactions in parallel, the reported speedup that they can achieve is far from ideal. The main reason is that the proposed parallel execution mechanisms cannot effectively deal with the conflicts inherent in many blockchain applications.In this work, we thoroughly study the historical transaction execution traces in Ethereum. We observe that application-inherent conflicts are the major factors that limit the exploitable parallelism during execution. We propose to use partitioned counters and special commutative instructions to break up the application conflict chains in order to maximize the potential speedup. When we evaluated the maximum parallel speedup achievable, these techniques doubled this limit to an 18x overall speedup compared to serial execution, thus approaching the optimum. We also propose OCC-DA, an optimistic concurrency control scheduler with deterministic aborts, which makes it possible to use OCC scheduling in public blockchain settings.},

abstract = {With the continuous advancement of Power Blockchain constructions, many domestic companies have established multiple blockchain applications such as Smart Contract, Smart Finance, Energy Cloud and so on. While blockchain is in the stage of developing, thus there exists a lot of problems on these established blockchain applications. Supervision on chain data is one of these problems and it is always difficult, in order to resolve this problem, we propose a supervising method based on relay mechanism to monitor the chain data adaptively and to detect and control the abnormal data timely. We generate the data according to the data structure of the power distribution automation system for anomaly detection. The experimental results show that the proposed supervision algorithm detects abnormal power data in time, and adaptively updates the algorithm parameters according to the changes of the data on the chain, ensuring the accuracy of the detection results, and can help the supervisory unit to supervise the data on chain.},

abstract = {While 5G can provide high-speed Internet connectivity and over-the-horizon control for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), authentication becomes a key security component in 5G-enabled UAVs. This is due to fact that the communicating entities in the network mostly uses unsecured communication channel to exchange critical surveillance data. Authentication thus plays a crucial role in the 5G-enabled UAV network, providing a range of security services such as credential privacy, Session-Key (SK) security, and secure mutual authentication. However, transparency, anonymity, traceability and centralized control are few major security requirements that cannot be fulfilled by the traditional authentication schemes. One of the upcoming technologies that can provide a solution for present centralized 5G-enabled UAV network is blockchain-based authentication scheme. Motivated from aforementioned discussion, this paper presents a Permissioned Blockchain empowered Secure Authentication and Key Agreement framework in 5G-enabled UAVs. In this framework, first an authentication phase between UAV-to-UAV, UAV-to-Edge Server (ES) and Edge-to-Cloud Server (CS) supporting mutual authentication and key agreement is proposed. The authenticated surveillance data collected from UAV is used by the peer-to-peer CS for transaction verification, block creation and addition using smart contract-based consensus mechanism. The practical implementation of framework shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Many blockchains utilize public peer-to-peer networks to communicate transactions. As activity on blockchain-based DeFi protocols has increased, there has been a sharp rise in strategic behaviour from bots and miners, commonly captured by the notion of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). While many works have focused on MEV arising from the smart contract layer or consensus layer, in this work we study how a strategic agent can maximise realisable MEV through the optimal choice of network peers. Specifically, we study how existing definitions and algorithms for latency optimization can be augmented with information about the transactions themselves in order to optimize peering algorithms. We formally model this optimization objective for two classes of consensus protocols : 1) time-based ("fair ordering") protocols and 2) single leader-based protocols. We present an efficient local algorithm for choosing peers strategically, and evaluate our algorithm on real world data to show that it outperforms benchmark algorithms that either choose peers randomly or do not exploit information about blockchain transactions.},

abstract = {Fixing bugs is easiest by patching source code. However, source code is not always available: only 0.3% of the ∼ 49M smart contracts that are currently deployed on Ethereum have their source code publicly available. Moreover, since contracts may call functions from other contracts, security flaws in closed-source contracts may affect open-source contracts as well. However, current state-of-the-art approaches that operate on closed-source contracts (i.e.,&nbsp;EVM bytecode), such as EVMPatch and SmartShield, make use of purely hard-coded templates that leverage fix patching patterns. As a result, they cannot dynamically adapt to the bytecode that is being patched, which severely limits their flexibility and scalability. For instance, when patching integer overflows using hard-coded templates, a particular patch template needs to be employed as the bounds to be checked are different for each integer size (i.e.,&nbsp;one template for uint256, another template for uint64, etc.). In this paper, we propose Elysium, a scalable approach towards automatic smart contract repair at the bytecode level. Elysium combines template-based and semantic-based patching by inferring context information from bytecode. Elysium is currently able to patch 7 different types of vulnerabilities in smart contracts automatically and can easily be extended with new templates and new bug-finding tools. We evaluate its effectiveness and correctness using 3 different datasets by replaying more than 500K transactions on patched contracts. We find that Elysium outperforms existing tools by patching at least 30% more contracts correctly. Finally, we also compare the overhead of Elysium in terms of deployment and transaction cost. In comparison to other tools, we find that generally Elysium minimizes the runtime cost (i.e.,&nbsp;transaction cost) up to a factor of 1.7, for only a marginally higher deployment cost, where deployment cost is a one-time cost as compared to the runtime cost.},

abstract = {Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have emerged as a way to collect digital art as well as an investment vehicle. Despite having been popularized only recently, NFT markets have witnessed several high-profile (and high-value) asset sales and a tremendous growth in trading volumes over the last year. Unfortunately, these marketplaces have not yet received much security scrutiny. Instead, most academic research has focused on attacks against decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and automated techniques to detect smart-contract vulnerabilities. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the market dynamics and security issues of the multi-billion dollar NFT ecosystem.In this paper, we first present a systematic overview of how the NFT ecosystem works, and we identify three major actors: marketplaces, external entities, and users. We then perform an in-depth analysis of the top 8 marketplaces (ranked by transaction volume) to discover potential issues, many of which can lead to substantial financial losses. We also collected a large amount of asset and event data pertaining to the NFTs being traded in the examined marketplaces. We automatically analyze this data to understand how the entities external to the blockchain are able to interfere with NFT markets, leading to serious consequences, and quantify the malicious trading behaviors carried out by users under the cloak of anonymity.},

abstract = {Out-of-gas errors occur when smart contract programs are provided with inputs that cause excessive gas consumption and which will be easily exploited to perform DoS attacks. Various approaches have been proposed to estimate the gas limit of a function in smart contracts to avoid such error. However, underestimation often occurs when the contract is complex In this work, we propose V-Gas, which automatically generates inputs that maximize the gas cost and reduce underestimation. V-Gas is designed based on static analysis and feedback-directed mutational fuzz testing. First, V-Gas builds the gas weighted control flow graph (WCFG) of functions in smart contracts. Then, V-Gas develops gas consumption guided selection and mutation strategies to generate the input that maximize the gas consumption. For evaluation, we implement V-Gas based on js-evm, a widely used ethereum virtual machine written in Javascript, and conduct experiments on 736 real-world transactions recorded on Ethereum. 44.02% of the transactions would have out-of-gas errors based on the estimation results given by solc, means that the recorded real gas consumption for those transactions is larger than the gas limit estimated by solc. In comparison V-Gas could reduce the under estimation ratio to 13.86%. In order to evaluate the performance of feedback-directed engine in V-Gas, we implemented other directed fuzzing engines and compare their performance with V-Gas’s. The results showed that V-Gas generates the same or higher gas estimation value on 97.8% of the transactions with less time, usually within 5 minutes. Furthermore, V-Gas has exposed 25 previously unknown out-of-gas vulnerabilities in widely-used smart contracts, 6 of which have been assigned unique CVE identifiers in the US National Vulnerability Database.},

abstract = {There is an ongoing effort to provide programming abstractions that ease the burden of exploiting multicore hardware. Many programming abstractions (e.g., concurrent objects, transactional memory, etc.) simplify matters, but still involve intricate engineering. We argue that some difficulty of multicore programming can be meliorated through a declarative programming style in which programmers directly express the independence of fragments of sequential programs. In our proposed paradigm, programmers write programs in a familiar, sequential manner, with the added ability to explicitly express the conditions under which code fragments sequentially commute. Putting such commutativity conditions into source code offers a new entry point for a compiler to exploit the known connection between commutativity and parallelism. We give a semantics for the programmer’s sequential perspective and, under a correctness condition, find that a compiler-transformed parallel execution is equivalent to the sequential semantics. Serializability/linearizability are not the right fit for this condition, so we introduce scoped serializability and show how it can be enforced with lock synthesis techniques. We next describe a technique for automatically verifying and synthesizing commute conditions via a new reduction from our commute blocks to logical specifications, upon which symbolic commutativity reasoning can be performed. We implemented our work in a new language called Veracity, implemented in Multicore OCaml. We show that commutativity conditions can be automatically generated across a variety of new benchmark programs, confirm the expectation that concurrency speedups can be seen as the computation increases, and apply our work to a small in-memory filesystem and an adaptation of a crowdfund blockchain smart contract.},

abstract = {The Solidity programming language is the most widely used language for smart contract development. Improving smart contracts’ correctness, security, and performance has been the driving force for research in vulnerability detection, program analysis, and compiler techniques for Solidity. Similar to system-level languages such as C, Solidity enables the embedding of low-level code in programs, in the form of inline assembly code. Developers use inline assembly for low-level optimizations, extending the Solidity language through libraries, and using blockchain-specific opcodes only available through inline assembly. Nevertheless, inline assembly fragments are not well understood by an average developer and can introduce security threats as well as affect the optimizations that can be applied to programs by the compiler; it also significantly limits the effectiveness of source code static analyzers that operate on the Solidity level. A better understanding of how inline assembly is used in practice could in turn increase the performance, security, and support for inline assembly in Solidity. This paper presents a large-scale quantitative study of the use of inline assembly in 6.8M smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. We find that 23% of the analyzed smart contracts contain inline assembly code, and that the use of inline assembly has become more widespread over time. We further performed a manual qualitative analysis for identifying usage patterns of inline assembly in Solidity smart contracts. Our findings are intended to help practitioners understand when they should use inline assembly and guide developers of Solidity tools in prioritizing which parts of inline assembly to implement first. Finally, the insights of this study could be used to enhance the Solidity language, improve the Solidity compiler, and to open up new research directions by driving future researchers to build appropriate methods and techniques for replacing inline assembly in Solidity programs when there is no real necessity to use it.},

abstract = {Zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) mixers are one of the most widely-used blockchain privacy solutions, operating on top of smart contract-enabled blockchains. We find that ZKP mixers are tightly intertwined with the growing number of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) attacks and Blockchain Extractable Value (BEV) extractions. Through coin flow tracing, we discover that 205 blockchain attackers and 2, 595 BEV extractors leverage mixers as their source of funds, while depositing a total attack revenue of 412.87M USD. Moreover, the US OFAC sanctions against the largest ZKP mixer, Tornado.Cash, have reduced the mixer’s daily deposits by more than . Further, ZKP mixers advertise their level of privacy through a so-called anonymity set size, which similarly to k-anonymity allows a user to hide among a set of k other users. Through empirical measurements, we, however, find that these anonymity set claims are mostly inaccurate. For the most popular mixers on Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Smart Chain (BSC), we show how to reduce the anonymity set size on average by and respectively. Our empirical evidence is also the first to suggest a differing privacy-predilection of users on ETH and BSC. State-of-the-art ZKP mixers are moreover interwoven with the DeFi ecosystem by offering anonymity mining (AM) incentives, i.e., users receive monetary rewards for mixing coins. However, contrary to the claims of related work, we find that AM does not necessarily improve the quality of a mixer’s anonymity set. Our findings indicate that AM attracts privacy-ignorant users, who then do not contribute to improving the privacy of other mixer users.},

abstract = {Human decision making is central in many functions across a broad spectrum of fields such as marketing, investment, smart contract formulations, political campaigns, and organizational strategic management. Behavioral economics seeks to study the psychological, cultural, and social factors contributing to decision making along reasoning. It should be highlighted here that behavioral economics do not negate classical economic theory but rather extend it in two distinct directions. First, a finer granularity can be obtained by studying the decision making process not of massive populations but instead of individuals and groups with signal estimation or deep learning techniques based on a wide array of attributes ranging from social media posts to physiological signs. Second, time becomes a critical parameter and changes to the disposition towards alternative decisions can be tracked with input-output or state space models. The primary findings so far are concepts like bounded rationality and perceived risk, while results include optimal strategies for various levels of information awareness and action strategies based on perceived loss aversion principles. From the above it follows that behavioral economics relies on deep learning, signal processing, control theory, social media analysis, affective computing, natural language processing, and gamification to name only a few fields. Therefore, it is directly tied to computer science in many ways. THECOG will be a central meeting point for researchers of various backgrounds in order to generate new interdisciplinary and groundbreaking results.},

abstract = {Nowadays, many digital assets are generated all the time, and managing these digital assets has become an important issue. The traditional digital asset management system manages data by the service provider, and data is not processed transparently. Furthermore, centralized storage makes Single Point of Failure (SPOF), and it is also challenging to ensure that data backed up by all nodes are synchronized. Rapid improvement of blockchain technology, the above two problems are resolved by leveraging blockchain’s decentralization and tamper resistance characteristics. The EU General Data Protection Rules (GDPR) state the principles for protecting data owners in 2018. Several principles for deleting personal data conflict with the blockchain, such as Storage Limit and the Right to Be Forgotten. The existing blockchain-enabled digital asset management methods do not apply to the GDPR. Although some methods are proposed for storing digital assets in off-chain storage and storing the hash address of storage in the blockchain, the problem of SPOF has not been resolved yet. This motivates to propose SPChain, a smarter and private GDPR-compliant digital asset framework enabled by blockchain and decentralized InterPlanetary File System is implemented to solve the problem of SPOF. The proposed SPChain to digital art management provides an implementation using Hyperledger Fabric. The proposed framework consists of a model developer, art creator, collector, service provider and securely assessed AI model for managing digital assets. The experiments measured throughput, latency and resource consumption of various functions in the smart contract’s artwork_CC, walle_CC, 3A_CC, log_CC, model_CC. This proposed work is the first novel work to combine digital asset management with detailed design of the decentralized off-chain storage and artificial intelligence models.},

One example that has already attracted design-oriented research are medical prescriptions. However, current implementations of electronic prescription management systems typically create centralized data silos, leaving user data vulnerable to cybersecurity incidents and impeding interoperability. Research has also proposed decentralized solutions based on blockchain technology, but privacy-related challenges have often been ignored. We conduct design science research to develop and implement a system for the exchange of electronic prescriptions that builds on two blockchains and a digital wallet app. Our solution combines the bilateral, verifiable, and privacy-focused exchange of information between doctors, patients, and pharmacies through verifiable credentials with a token-based, anonymized double-spending check. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations as well as a security analysis suggest that this architecture can improve existing approaches to electronic prescription management by offering patients control over their data by design, a high level of security, sufficient performance and scalability, and interoperability with emerging digital identity management solutions for users, businesses, and institutions. We also derive principles on how to design decentralized, privacy-oriented information systems that require both the exchange of sensitive information and double-usage protection.},

While a long and fruitful line of work has succeeded to identify its exact security region---that is, the set of parametrizations under which it possesses asymptotic security---the existing theory does not provide concrete settlement time guarantees that are tight enough to inform practice.In this work we provide a new approach for obtaining concrete and practical settlement time guarantees suitable for reasoning about deployed systems. We give an efficient method for computing explicit upper bounds on settlement time as a function of primary system parameters: honest and adversarial computational power and a bound on network delays. We implement this computational method and provide a comprehensive sample of concrete bounds for several settings of interest. We also analyze a well-known attack strategy to provide lower bounds on the settlement times. For Bitcoin, for example, our upper and lower bounds are within 90 seconds of each other for 1-hour settlement assuming 10 second network delays and a 10% adversary. In comparison, the best prior result has a gap of 2 hours in the upper and lower bounds with the same parameters.},

Consequently, commit latencies in today’s permissionless blockchain landscape remain prohibitively high.This article proposes NimbleChain, a novel algorithm that extends permissionless blockchains based on Nakamoto consensus with a fast path that delivers causal promises of commitment or simply promises. Since promises only partially order transactions, their latency is only a small fraction of the totally ordered commitment latency of Nakamoto consensus. Still, the weak consistency guarantees of promises are strong enough to correctly implement cryptocurrencies. To the best of our knowledge, NimbleChain is the first system to bring together fast, partially ordered transactions with consensus-based, totally ordered transactions in a permissionless setting. This hybrid consistency model is able to speed up cryptocurrency transactions while still supporting smart contracts, which typically have (strong) sequential consistency needs.We implement NimbleChain as an extension of Ethereum and evaluate it in a 500-node geo-distributed deployment. The results show NimbleChain can promise a cryptocurrency transactions up to an order of magnitude faster than a vanilla Ethereum implementation, with marginal overheads.},

abstract = {Decentralized Finance (DeFi) – an ecosystem of financial applications built on top of blockchain technology – has kept powering ahead and attracted a large amount of capital in just a few years. As the core part of the DeFi ecosystem, decentralized lending protocols allow users to become lenders or borrowers in a completely decentralized fashion, such that an individual has complete control over their funds at all times. Collecting, analyzing, and visualizing lending data are crucial as these lending protocols are growing steadily. This paper presents an analysis model for decentralized lending protocols. Our main contributions are as follows. (i) We analyze and compare the top lending protocols; (ii) We present a general model to collect and process a large amount of data from multiple lending protocols in an exact and efficient manner; (iii) We design and implement a lending visualization system with various charts divided into three categories, i.e., lending market overview, token analysis, and user analysis.},

In this scenario, timing is crucial to determine the success or failure of an investment opportunity. In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of sniper bots, automated tools designed to buy tokens as soon as they are listed on the market. We leverage GitHub open-source repositories of sniper bots to analyze their features and how they are implemented. Then, we build a dataset of Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain (BSC) liquidity pools to identify addresses that serially take advantage of sniper bots. Our findings reveal 14,029 sniping operations on Ethereum and 1,395,042 in BSC that bought tokens for a total of $10,144,808 dollars and $18,720,447, respectively. We find that Ethereum operations have a higher success rate but require a larger investment. Finally, we analyze token smart contracts to identify mechanisms that can hinder sniper bots.},

abstract = {As an emerging blockchain technique, the blockchain-based loot box has received significant attention recently due to its promising characters in transparency and decentralization. Because all virtual assets are bound to the players' own address, which allows the players to control and manage everything, players can trade virtual items via the 2nd exChange Market (2CM) directly. To understand the players' optimal strategies and the game provider's optimal pricing, we conduct an economic analysis of both the game provider's and players' behaviors. In addition, gas fee, a unique factor in blockchain, is taken into consideration. Specifically, we model the interactions between the game provider and players as a two-stage Stackelberg game. In Stage I, we model the game provider's optimal pricing problem to maximize his utility using prospect theory (PT) due to the intrinsic demand uncertainty. In Stage II, the players choose the market which can maximize their utility to derive their preferred items. Moreover, our analysis and numerical results show that a game provider who considers the PT modeling should adopt a conservative pricing mechanism to increase his utility. Besides, the primary market is more susceptible to gas fees than the 2CM.},

As all the currently available sources are in Russian, our presentation also aims at serving the international community by making the description available in English for further studies. In the second part of the paper, we provide an initial analysis of the protocol, identifying the potential weaknesses under the assumptions of corruption of the relevant key components. As a result, we conclude that the biggest problems of the system stem from weak voter authentication. In addition, as it was possible to vote from any device with a browser and Internet access, the attack surface was relatively large in general.},

There are several ways to make donations or payments, such as bank transfers and credit cards. However, it is not known exactly whether the investment was in fact for the proper purpose. In this scenario, blockchain stands out with cryptocurrency applications and smart contracts, adding credibility to the transactions carried out even if in a decentralized manner, and providing traceability. The objective of this work is to propose a solution to the problem of traceability of money invested by financiers, in addition to an analysis of financial costs and transaction times, helping investors to understand where the funds raised go. To meet the objective, an architecture was designed and the Ethereum blockchain was used in the experiments, concluding that it is necessary to evaluate the cost benefit of the solution and the size of the data to be stored in the blockchain, as well as the variations in the ether values at the time of conversion to the local currency.},

abstract = {Mutation analysis is a powerful dynamic approach that has many applications, such as measuring the quality of test suites or automatically locating faults. However, the inherent low scalability hampers its practical use. To accelerate mutation analysis, researchers propose approaches to reduce redundant executions. A family of fork-based approaches tries to share identical executions among mutants. Fork-based approaches carry all mutants in one process and decide whether to fork new child processes when reaching a mutated statement. The mutants carried by the parent process are split into groups and distributed to different processes to finish the remaining executions. However, existing fork-based approaches have two limitations: (1) the limited analysis scope on a single statement to compare and cluster mutants prevents their systems from detecting more equivalent mutants, and (2) the interpretation of the mutants and the runtime equivalence analysis introduce significant overhead.In this paper, we present a novel fork-based mutation analysis approach WinMut, which (1) groups mutants in a scope of mutated statements and, (2) removes redundant computations inside interpreters. WinMut not only reduces the number of invoked processes but also has a lower cost for executing a single process. Our experiments show that our approach can further accelerate mutation analysis with an average speedup of 5.57x on top of the state-of-the-art fork-based approach, AccMut.},

abstract = {Analysis models, technologies and tools are extensively used in the automotive domain to validate and optimize the design and implementation of SW systems. This is especially true for modern systems including advanced autonomous (and complex) features. The range of analysis methods that can be applied is extremely wide and goes from functional correctness to functional safety to timing (and schedulability), security, and possibly even more. The AUTOSAR automotive standard has been defined with the purpose of standardizing the SW architecture of automotive systems and enable the construction of systems by composing SW components that are portable and abstract with respect to the underlying HW/SW platform. However, AUTOSAR was originally developed with portability of code in mind, and even if it quickly evolved to include a system-level modeling language (with its metamodel) and later extensions to deal with the needs of analysis methods (and tools), it is hardly comprehensive and still affected by several omissions and limitations. To fix the limitations with respect to timing and schedulability analysis Bosch developed the Amalthea (later App4MC) metamodel and tools. In Huawei, a more general (and ambitious) approach was undertaken to support not only timing analysis, but also model checking (or other types of formal verification), safety analysis and even design optimization. The approach is based on the concepts of a unified (modular) metamodel and a framework based on Eclipse to integrate analysis methods and tools. In this paper we describe the framework and the results obtained with respect to the objectives of functional verification and timing analysis.},

It is found that the strengthening of regulatory policies had an evidently negative influence on the market. Combined with the analysis of the features of typical cryptocurrencies, this paper figures out that on the whole there is a strong correlation between the abnormal returns of currencies in the cryptocurrency market. At the same time, by analyzing the performance of daily abnormal returns of Bitcoin and Ether in the event window, this study draws a conclusion that investors in that market have patent speculativeness. In addition, complimentary survey on stable coin is also done to verify the overall policy impact, which indicates that the market value fluctuation of stable coin is consistent with the abnormal return changes of the whole market. On this basis, through information query and literature reference, this paper also forecasts the evolution trend of regulatory policies in various countries and the development of the overall cryptocurrency market by period.},

abstract = {We present a measurement study on compositions of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols, which aim to disrupt traditional finance and offer services on top of distributed ledgers, such as Ethereum. Understanding DeFi compositions is of great importance, as they may impact the development of ecosystem interoperability, are increasingly integrated with web technologies, and may introduce risks through complexity. Starting from a dataset of 23 labeled DeFi protocols and 10,663,881 associated Ethereum accounts, we study the interactions of protocols and associated smart contracts. From a network perspective, we find that decentralized exchange (DEX) and lending protocol account nodes have high degree and centrality values, that interactions among protocol nodes primarily occur in a strongly connected component, and that known community detection methods cannot disentangle DeFi protocols. Therefore, we propose an algorithm to decompose a protocol call into a nested set of building blocks that may be part of other DeFi protocols. This allows us to untangle and study protocol compositions. With a ground truth dataset that we have collected, we can demonstrate the algorithm’s capability by finding that swaps are the most frequently used building blocks. As building blocks can be nested, that is, contained in each other, we provide visualizations of composition trees for deeper inspections. We also present a broad picture of DeFi compositions by extracting and flattening the entire nested building block structure across multiple DeFi protocols. Finally, to demonstrate the practicality of our approach, we present a case study that is inspired by the recent collapse of the UST stablecoin in the Terra ecosystem. Under the hypothetical assumption that the stablecoin USD Tether would experience a similar fate, we study which building blocks — and, thereby, DeFi protocols — would be affected. Overall, our results and methods contribute to a better understanding of a new family of financial products.},

This paper innovatively integrates the principle of blockchain into the traceability and circulation process of Hebei cold chain food. In order to find the proportion and distribution of various types of commodities in the circulation of imported and domestic cold chain food in Hebei Province, the combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis methods, chi square test, association rules and other analysis methods are used. The results show that the demand for cold chain food in Hebei Province is mainly domestic food and supplemented by imported food. Cold chain poultry is the main need and other cold chain food is supplement. The flow of imported cold chain food is mainly from the surrounding provinces and cities. Furthermore, in the process of tracing the positive commodities, it is found that there are four main modes of commodity circulation in Hebei Province, namely, family model from farmer, wholesale market, new retail and multi-level sales model. The new retail and multi-level sales model fill the gap in the distribution and circulation of cold chain goods in Hebei Province.},

Using rich data from the Ethereum blockchain, the mempool, and exchanges, we study the effect of EIP-1559, one of the earliest-deployed TFMs that depart from the traditional first-price auction paradigm. We conduct a rigorous and comprehensive empirical study to examine its causal effect on blockchain transaction fee dynamics, transaction waiting times, and consensus security. Our results show that EIP-1559 improves the user experience by mitigating intrablock differences in the gas price paid and reducing users' waiting times. However, EIP-1559 has only a small effect on gas fee levels and consensus security. In addition, we find that when Ether's price is more volatile, the waiting time is significantly higher. We also verify that a larger block size increases the presence of siblings. These findings suggest new directions for improving TFMs.},

abstract = {The execution of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain consumes gas paid for by users submitting contracts' invocation requests. A contract execution proceeds as long as the users dedicate enough gas, within the limit set by Ethereum. If insufficient gas is provided, the contract execution halts and changes made during execution get reverted. Unfortunately, contracts may contain code patterns that increase execution cost, causing the contracts to run out of gas. These patterns can be manipulated by malicious attackers to induce unwanted behavior in the targeted victim contracts, e.g., Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. We call these gas-related vulnerabilities. We propose eTainter, a static analyzer for detecting gas-related vulnerabilities based on taint tracking in the bytecode of smart contracts. We evaluate eTainter by comparing it with the prior work, MadMax, on a dataset of annotated contracts. The results show that eTainter outperforms MadMax in both precision and recall, and that eTainter has a precision of 90% based on manual inspection. We also use eTainter to perform large-scale analysis of 60,612 real-world contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. We find that gas-related vulnerabilities exist in 2,763 of these contracts, and that eTainter analyzes a contract in eight seconds, on average.},

abstract = {The mainstream adoption of blockchains led to the preparation of many decentralized applications and web platforms, including Web 3.0, a peer-to-peer internet with no single authority. The data stored in blockchain can be considered as big data -- massive-volume, dynamic, and heterogeneous. Due to highly connected structure, graph-based modeling is an optimal tool to analyze the data stored in blockchains. Recently, several research works performed graph analysis on the publicly available blockchain data to reveal insights into its business transactions and for critical downstream tasks, e.g., cryptocurrency price prediction, phishing scams and counterfeit token detection. In this tutorial, we discuss relevant literature on blockchain data structures, storage, categories, data extraction and graphs construction, graph mining, topological data analysis, and machine learning methods used, target applications, and the new insights revealed by them, aiming towards providing a clear view of unified graph-data models for UTXO and account-based blockchains.

For example, they use different consensus algorithms, different languages to program smart contracts, and allocate and manage on-chain resources in different ways. In this paper, we perform in-depth analysis of the models used by EOS.IO blockchain to manage its resources (i.e., ram, cpu and network bandwidth). For this purpose, we instantiate an EOS.IO-based Decentralized Application (DApp) implementing a Decentralized Rating Framework and we measure its resource requirements. Finally, we evaluate and compare the cost in fees required for running the DApp under three different resource management models provided by EOS.IO, which are the staking, rex, and power up models.},

abstract = {Blockchain has attracted more and more attention of academia, industry and government in recent decade. Different usage demands have inspired various blockchain designs, forming different blockchain systems, which however leads to information islands. Many cross-chain technologies have been proposed to link different blockchains together and expand the utility of blockchain. Nevertheless, the cross-chain technology is still in its infancy, which faces many problems that retard its wide application, for example, the issues related to security, privacy and effectiveness. In order to further investigate cross-chain technologies, it is essential to understand its current state of arts. Although there are some surveys about cross-chain technologies driven by specific demands, the literature still lacks a comprehensive survey focusing on security, privacy and effectiveness of cross-chain technologies. In this paper, we provide a review on existing cross-chain technologies based on a comprehensive set of criteria on security, privacy and other performance. We first propose a blockchain interoperability architecture for the purpose of analyzing potential threats and problems regarding security, privacy and effectiveness. We then summarize a set of criteria regarding these quality attributes. Next, we comprehensively review the representative works on cross-chain technologies according to a taxonomy based on applied types of techniques and cross-chain purposes. In each work review, we provide a serious discussion on its pros and cons by employing our proposed criteria. Finally, based on our review and analysis, we figure out a number of open issues and step ahead to direct future research directions on cross-chain technologies.},

Blockchain facilitates fast, secure, and cross-border payments without the need for intermediaries such as banks. Because blockchain technology is still emerging, systematically organised knowledge providing a holistic and comprehensive view on designing payment applications that use blockchain is yet to be established. If such knowledge could be established in the form of a set of blockchain-specific patterns, architects could use those patterns in designing a payment application that leverages blockchain. Therefore, in this paper, we first identify a token’s lifecycle and then present 12 patterns that cover critical aspects in enabling the state transitions of a token in blockchain-based payment applications. The lifecycle and the annotated patterns provide a payment-focused systematic view of system interactions and a guide to effective use of the patterns.},

abstract = {With the widespread development of cloud-native technologies, the security of cloud-native system has gradually attracted attention. Cloud-native uses PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) to provide an important guarantee for cloud-native network security, however the heavy certificate management gradually makes the PKI mechanism be a bottleneck for cloud-native systems. In constract with PKI, the certificateless public key mechanism has many advantages such as lightness, which is very suitable for authentication in cloud-native environment. However, before introducing the certificateless public key mechanism into the cloud-native environment, the first problem that must be solved is the identity management. This paper proposes a blockchain-based certificateless identity management (BCL-IM) mechanism for cloud-native environment, which uses blockchain as a trust endorsement for service identity and service public key distribution records, and ensures the timeliness of identity management by blockchain node notification. In addition, a communication disconnect mechanism is also proposed and the usage scenarios of this mechanism are analyzed to ensure the data security. Finally, we give security analysis and performance evaluation to show that our scheme satisfies the requirements for secure service-to-service communication in cloud-native environments based on the certificateless public key mechanism.},

abstract = {Blockchain technology has emerged as a promising solution for secure data storage and retrieval for decentralized applications. To scale up the blockchain services, a common approach is to employ a hybrid storage architecture, where only meta-data are stored on-chain and the raw data are outsourced to an off-chain storage service provider. In this scenario, users need to query the data on-chain and off-chain at the same time, and the key issue for query processing would be how to design a gas-efficient authenticated data structure (ADS) to guarantee the completeness and soundness. In this paper, we study the spatial keyword authentication queries in the hybrid-storage blockchain, which includes on-chain and off-chain storage. We propose the GEMIR-tree index, which can significantly reduce the cost of maintenance by combing a single MIR-tree and a series of SMIR trees. Theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation are conducted to validate the performance of GEMIR-tree. Experimental results show that, compared to the baseline solution, the proposed GEMIR-tree index can efficiently reduce gas cost.},

However, edge-based IoT systems currently face challenges in their decentralized trust management. Trust management is essential to obtain reliable mining and data fusion, improved user privacy and data security, and provisioning of services with context-awareness. In this survey, we first examine the edge-based IoT architectures currently reported in the literature. Then a complete review of trust requirements in edge-based IoT systems is produced. Also, we discuss about blockchain as a solution to solve several trust problems in IoT and analyze in detail the correlation between blockchain and edge computing. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis of performance aspects of trusted edge-based IoT systems and recommend promising research directions.},

abstract = {Big Data applications can revolutionize any platform by facilitating the analysis of large amounts of information. However, the biggest challenge associated with Big Data is overcoming the intellectual property barriers associated with the use of this data, especially in cross-database applications. Although intellectual property provisions have been formulated to limit inappropriate use and manage access to Big Data, it is difficult to make this trade-off and overcome the challenges of Big Data. This paper explores the limits of intellectual property rights in Big Data applications. The advent of Big Data requires an alternative conceptual framework along with security policies and regulations. The profound issues of copyright on cross-database platforms are highlighted in this paper, as well as the paradigm shift from ownership to control of access to and use of Big Data, especially on cross-database platforms. We also present a real-world case study of the underlying technologies of cross-data analytics (xdata.nict.jp). The xData platform aims to coordinate competing social, personal, and industrial interests in data to ensure fair access while minimizing legal and ethical threats. Finally, we discuss the idea of using blockchain-enabled smart contracts to protect intellectual property rights on cross-data platforms and highlight some important aspects of copyright issues, highlighting key issues and current open challenges.},

The direct exchange rate of two tokens may not match the cross-exchange rate in the market, and such price discrepancies open up arbitrage possibilities with trading through different cryptocurrencies cyclically. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation on cyclic arbitrages in DEXes. We propose a theoretical framework for studying cyclic arbitrage. With our framework, we analyze the profitability conditions and optimal trading strategies of cyclic transactions. We further examine exploitable arbitrage opportunities and the market size of cyclic arbitrages with transaction-level data of Uniswap V2. We find that traders have executed 292,606 cyclic arbitrages over eleven months and exploited more than 138 million USD in revenue. However, the revenue of the most profitable unexploited opportunity is persistently higher than 1 ETH (4,000 USD), which indicates that DEX markets may not be efficient enough. By analyzing how traders implement cyclic arbitrages, we find that traders can utilize smart contracts to issue atomic transactions and the atomic implementations could mitigate users’ financial loss in cyclic arbitrage from the price impact.},

However, the development of blockchain technology has promoted the birth of a new type of software system–decentralized applications. Composed of smart contracts, a type of application that implements the Ponzi scheme logic (called smart Ponzi schemes) has caused irreversible loss and hindered the development of blockchain technology. These smart contracts generally had a short life but involved a large amount of money. Whereas identification of these Ponzi schemes before causing financial loss has been significantly important, existing methods suffer from three main deficiencies, i.e., the insufficient dataset, the reliance on the transaction records, and the low accuracy. In this study, we first build a larger dataset. Then, a large number of features from multiple views, including bytecode, semantic, and developers, are extracted. These features are independent of the transaction records. Furthermore, we leveraged machine learning methods to build our identification model, i.e., Multi-view Cascade Ensemble model (MulCas). The experiment results show that MulCas can achieve higher performance and robustness in the scope of our dataset. Most importantly, the proposed method can identify smart Ponzi scheme at the creation time.},

This work addresses third party mediated systems for digital content where mutually unknown, and hence non-trusting, buyers, sellers and the mediator (third party) take part in an exchange protocol. We address the lack of guaranteed fairness, as defined above, in the existing platforms for this setting. We present TEDX, a decentralized solution for guaranteed three party fair exchange of digital goods with scalability and support for incremental deployment over the existing (non-fair) platforms. TEDX combines carefully crafted message exchanges with incentive schemes designed to deter malicious behavior. TEDX also leverages ideas from blockchain anchored state-channels to provide trusted execution while minimizing the operational overheads of blockchain. We present the design and a security analysis of TEDX to validate the claimed fairness properties. We also present the details of a prototype implementation of TEDX leveraging Hyperledger Fabric and performance evaluation of the same on a realistic testbed spanning five public cloud zones. Our results indicate that TEDX adds only a minimal overhead of 16% while being 46x faster than a naive blockchain solution, thereby demonstrating that TEDX is scalable.},

This paper proposes a system that allows for the update of the status of certificates and bases its function on a specific form of logs stored on Blockchains and a set of rules for the interpretation of these logs. Also an outline of a proof of concept implementation of the system in Ethereum together with a cost and security analysis are provided in the paper. The proposed architecture provides several benefits with the most prominent one being the suspension of certificates in case an already vaccinated individual is found positive. In existing certificate management systems a vaccinated individual that is tested positive still holds a valid vaccination certificate during the self-isolation period. This vulnerability allows infected individuals to commute freely and thus facilitates the spread of the pandemic. The proposed solution is not limited to COVID-19 related certificates, but rather it could be deployed in any kind of digital certificate.},

Federated learning has become an effective way to conduct deep learning when training data are distributed. However, traditional federated learning still faces the challenge of security and data heterogeneity. Specifically, the central server will introduce a single point of failure. Malicious clients and statistical heterogeneity of data will affect the performance of the model. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes FedDetectionBC, a federated learning framework for object detection model training, which takes advantage of blockchain to ensure the robustness and auditability of federated learning. To deal with data heterogeneity, a new algorithm (Exchange-FedAvg) is also proposed. Experimental results that FedDetectionBC is more robust than traditional federated learning when there exist malicious clients in the system. The proposed Exchanged-FedAvg can achieve higher accuracy with fewer communication rounds in non-IID settings.},

abstract = {Improving the quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE) for users of cyber-physical systems (CPS) is the key to the widespread promotion and deployment of this technology. Network latency is an important factor affecting users' network experience. Due to the limited processing capacity of a single device node of CPS, the communication relationship between equipment is extremely complicated, and multi-hop device nodes may be passed through in the middle, so designing an efficient routing scheme for CPS is a serious challenge. CPS routing also faces a security crisis. System nodes may send viruses or erroneous results to user equipment, and user equipment may also refuse to pay for routing services to system nodes. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a secure routing scheme based on blockchain. Blockchain is used to ensure secure transactions between system nodes and user equipment. At the same time, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technology is used, and two deep neural networks are used to train intelligent agent to achieve low-latency adaptive traffic scheduling. Experimental results show that the proposed autonomous routing technology can reduce the system communication latency by about 31.7%-45.4%.},

abstract = {Smart contracts (SCs) are software systems that monitor and control the execution of legal contracts to ensure compliance with the contracts' terms and conditions. They often exploit Internet-of-Things technologies to support their monitoring functions, and blockchain technology to ensure the integrity of their data. Ethereum and business blockchain platforms, such as Hyperledger Fabric, are popular choices for SC development. However, there is a gap in the knowledge of SCs between developers and legal experts. Symboleo is a formal specification language for legal contracts that was introduced to address this issue. Symboleo specifications directly encode legal concepts such as parties, obligations, and powers. In this paper, we propose a tool-supported method for translating Symboleo specifications into smart contracts. We have extended the current Symboleo IDE, implemented the ontology and semantics of Symboleo into a reusable library, and developed the Symboleo2SC tool to generate Hyperledger Fabric code exploiting this library. Symboleo2SC was evaluated with three sample contracts. The results shows that legal contract specifications in Symboleo can be fully converted to SCs for monitoring purposes. Moreover, Symboleo2SC helps simplify the SC development process, saves development effort, and helps reduce risks of coding errors.},

A benchmark suite with vulnerable smart contracts was also developed for evaluation and comparison with other verification tools. The experiments performed here showed that ESBMC-Solidity detected all vulnerabilities, was the fastest tool and provided a counterexample for each benchmark.

However, some blockchain systems are not feasible in the environment of sensor networks. In this paper, we propose a comparative analysis of blockchain-based electronic voting systems from the perspective of blockchain type, cryptography techniques, counting method, and security requirements.

Such emerging technology framing the creation and exchange of digital object, started years ago with early projects such as ”CryptoPunks” and since early 2021, has received an increasing interest by a community of people creating, buying, selling NFTs and by the media reporting to the general public. In this work it is shown how the landscape of one class of projects, specifically those used as social media profile pictures, has become mainstream with leading projects such as ”Bored Ape Yacht Club”, ”Cool Cats” and ”Doodles”. This work illustrates how heterogeneous data was collected from the Ethereum blockchain and Twitter and then analysed using algorithms and state-of-art metrics related to graphs. The initial results show that from a social network perspective, the collections of most popular NFTs can be considered as a single community around NFTs. Thus, while each project has its own value and volume of exchange, on a social level all of them are primarily influenced by the evolution of values and trades of ”Bored Ape Yacht Club” collection.},

abstract = {In recent years, blockchain has been growing rapidly from a niche technology to a promising solution for many sectors, due to its unique properties that empower the design of innovative applications. Nevertheless, the development of blockchain applications is still a challenge. Due to the technological novelty, only a few developers are familiar with blockchain technologies and smart contracts. Others might face a steep learning curve or difficulties to reuse existing code to build blockchain applications. This study proposes a novel approach to tackle these issues, through software product line engineering. To support the approach, a web platform to configure and generate a blockchain application for on-chain traceability is introduced. First, a feature model has been designed to model core features of the chosen domain, based on the existing literature. Then, a configurator has been implemented to support the feature selection phase. Finally, a generator is able to ingest such configurations to generate on-the-shelf blockchain products. The generalizability of the contribution is validated by reproducing on-chain traceability applications proposed in the literature by using the platform. This work provides the first evidence that the implementation of blockchain applications using software product lines enhances the quality of produced applications and reduces the time to market.},

Contracts in SigVM can emit signal events, on which other contracts can listen. Once an event is triggered, corresponding handler functions are automatically executed as signal transactions. We build an end-to-end blockchain platform SigChain and a contract language compiler SigSolid to realize the potential of SigVM. Experimental results show that our benchmark applications can be reimplemented with SigVM in a truly decentralized way, eliminating the dependency on centralized and unreliable mechanisms like off-chain relay servers. The development effort of reimplementing these contracts with SigVM is small, i.e., we modified on average 3.17% of the contract code. The runtime and the gas overhead of SigVM on these contracts is negligible.},

To address this problem, we present our protocol based on a trusted root chain, Ethereum for example. Organization or Government agencies with independent digital economy systems are connected in a tree-like hierarchy with smart contracts to the root chain. User assets can freely flow from root chain to any digital economy system with safety guaranteed and timely withdraw strategy. We release the burden of root chain by periodic write headers through smart contracts. A fraud proof challenge solution and security deposit strategy are presented to solve the data access problem. With this protocol, diversity of digital assets system can be built without efforts to earn trusts from public, and the connections between them are easily implemented since they are inherited from the same root chain.},

abstract = {The global interest in taking preventative measures has intensified in response to the coronavirus epidemic. The vaccination certificate is one approach used to control the spread of disease while enabling people to carry out their regular lives and interact with each other as they normally would. Most services require their users to provide proof of immunization; however, the information they require seems to be either overly personal or unrelated to the service's intended use. Immunization Information System (IIS), the data owner, is indeed accountable for safeguarding client data and privacy in accordance with ethical considerations. In order to ensure that requests for data access are acknowledged by data subjects and that only the fields required to fulfill the usage purpose are given, some mechanisms must be presented. In this study, consent management blockchain with add-on modules that enable loose-coupling integration with existing vaccination applications is presented in an attempt to provide such functionality without adding extra burden to IIS. To limit the quantity and sensitivity of the data retrieved, a data filtering scheme is proposed. Additionally, a source authentication technique is introduced to guarantee that data is delivered to the authorized requesters. To make sure all transaction requests are processed regardless of limitations in the execution capability of the blockchain, job queues are presented to reduce transactions' conflicts. This allows multiple transactions to be executed in parallel and resolves scalability and performance concerns which are the major issues found when integrating blockchain with large-scaled production systems.},

abstract = {The core component of the blockchain is smart contracts, which are the basis for connecting countless nodes and executing transactions. In smart contracts, trust often replaces trust in the form of proof of workload, proof of identity, proof of authorization, etc. Therefore, in the transaction process of the core chain, the node usually sees a concept of quantity, and does not know the change course of the agent's trust, so that it cannot fully grasp the dynamic process of the agent and the change of the trust evaluation value. The researches of computational trust has deeply affected the global economic and social development, and have been widely used in some large platforms such as ICAO PKD trust platform, EU's eIDAS platform, US FICAM system and so on. The current solution is a combination of limited mathematical models and assumptions that are far from the operational level. Hyperledger has superior performance in data access, invocation, operability, tamperability, traceability and other aspects, and is more suitable for the study of computational trust models. This study introduces the hyperledger technology to construct a computational trust model, and the main factors affecting the computational trust model are analyzed by using the Hyperledger Fabric technology, which is as the form of one to one to correspond to each node in the hyperledger, and realizes the trust transmission of the node, by sorting each node in the consensus chain, and passes. The interface technology realizes the docking between the model and the Hyperledger Fabric system. And then this paper analyzes the composition system of the computational trust model based on Hyperledger Fabric.},

Interoperating DLTs enable network effects and synergies, and similarly to the rise of the Internet, it unlocks the full potential of the technology. However, due to the novelty of the area, interoperability mechanisms (IMs) are still not well understood, as interoperability is studied in silos. Consequently, choosing the proper IM for a use case is challenging.Our article has three contributions: first, we systematically study the research area of DLT interoperability by dissecting and analyzing previous work. We study the logical separation of interoperability layers, how a DLT can connect to others (connection mode), the object of interoperation (interoperation mode), and propose a new categorization for IMs. Second, we propose the first interoperability assessment for DLTs that systematically evaluates the interoperability degree of an IM. This framework allows comparing the potentiality, compatibility, and performance among solutions.Finally, we propose two decision models to assist in choosing an IM, considering different requirements. The first decision model assists in choosing the infrastructure of an IM, while the second decision model assists in choosing its functionality.},

Different access control systems have been proposed for different IoT environments, many are remaining only at a conceptual level. In this paper, we propose a decentralized, ledger-based, publish-subscribe based architecture for the administration of access in a smart home IoT environment to preside at the assignments of underlying operational authorizations. Proposed architecture is endorsed by a proof-of-concept implementation, which utilizes smart contracts to ensure the integrity of administration supplemented by intrinsic benefits of blockchain to be distributed and transparent. Despite the rising hype around the blockchain technology that stokes its utilization in different domains, utilizing it for access control purposes is not yet promising. Our implementation results assure using blockchain for administrative access control is propitious, while is not yet appropriate for operational access control, which have been mainly the focus of previously proposed blockchain-based access control works.},

According to Chainalysis, in 2021, approx. $14 billion has been lost due to various incidents, and this number is dominated by Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications. To address these issues, one can use a collection of tools ranging from auditing to formal methods. We use formal verification and provide the first formalisation of a DeFi contract in a foundational proof assistant capturing contract interactions. We focus on Dexter2, a decentralized, non-custodial exchange for the Tezos network similar to Uniswap on Ethereum. The Dexter implementation consists of several smart contracts. This poses unique challenges for formalisation due to the complex contract interactions. Our formalisation includes proofs of functional correctness with respect to an informal specification for the contracts involved in Dexter’s implementation. Moreover, our formalisation is the first to feature proofs of safety properties of the interacting smart contracts of a decentralized exchange. We have extracted our contract from Coq into CameLIGO code, so it can be deployed on the Tezos blockchain. Uniswap and Dexter are paradigmatic for a collection of similar contracts. Our methodology thus allows us to implement and verify DeFi applications featuring similar interaction patterns.},

abstract = {State channel network is the most popular layer-2 solution to the issues of scalability, high transaction fees, and low transaction throughput of public Blockchain networks. However, the existing works have limitations that curb the wide adoption of the technology, such as the expensive creation and closure of channels, strict synchronization between the main chain and off-chain channels, frozen deposits, and inability to execute multi-party smart contracts. In this work, we present Speedster, an account-based state-channel system that aims to address the above issues. To this end, Speedster leverages the latest development of secure hardware to create dispute-free certified channels that can be operated efficiently off the Blockchain. Speedster is peer-to-peer decentralized and provides better privacy protection than prior channel projects. It supports fast native multi-party contract execution, which is previously unavailable in TEE-enabled channel networks. Compared to the Lightning Network, Speedster improves the throughput by about 10,000X and generates 97%$ less on-chain data with a comparable network scale.},

abstract = {Blockchain-driven image watermarking enables traceable and transparent watermark embedding for undeniable authenticity or proof of ownership. Nonetheless, blockchain public ledger is not suitable for privacy concern applications such as for personal health records or digital image transactions. This paper investigates the feasibility and impact of using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to preserve user privacy during watermark embedding while retaining the watermarking traceability using blockchain smart contracts. We evaluate the FHE feasibility using SVD-based watermarking by breaking down the SVD operations into fully and partial SVD operations. We consider three performance metrics: the noise budget, storage requirement, and computation cost. For quality evaluation, we analyze the effect of fractional encoding on the quality of the watermarked image and the embedded watermark. The results show that only the partial singular value addition (SVA) operation has a feasible performance by having low computation cost and low noise expense. It incurs a negligible degradation of the watermark quality, either on the watermarked image or in the extracted watermark data.},

abstract = {Public auditing and data deduplication are integral considerations in providing efficient and secure cloud storage services. Nevertheless, the traditional data deduplication models which support public auditing can endure the enormous waste of storage and computation resources induced through data redundancy and repeated audit work by multiple tenants on trusted third-party auditor (TPA). In this work, we introduce blockchain-based secure decentralized public auditing in a decentralized cloud storage with an efficient deduplication model. We employ blockchain to take on the task of centralized TPA, which also mitigates the implications of malicious blockchain miners by using the concept of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Specifically, we employ the idea of redactability for blockchain to handle often neglected security issues that would adversely affect the integrity of stored auditing records on blockchain in decentralized auditing models. On the other hand, the proposed model also employs an efficient deduplication scheme to attain adequate storage savings while preserving the users from data loss due to duplicate faking attacks. Moreover, the detailed concrete security analysis demonstrates the computational infeasibility of the proposed model against proof-of-ownership, duplicate faking attack (DFA), collusion attack, storage free-riding attack, data privacy, and forgery attack; with high efficiency. Finally, the comprehensive performance analysis shows the scalability and feasibility of the proposed model.},

abstract = {With the development of the economy and the improvement of people's quality of life, the public demand for food taste has gradually changed to the demand for food safety. In order to better facilitate the government to strengthen food safety supervision and protect people's food safety, it is necessary for the government to realize information interaction with enterprises related to the food supply chain and ensure the traceability of food flowing into the market by exchanging and sharing the data of food safety information. With the rapid promotion and popularization of various mobile terminals in the Internet era, the data analysis technology based on artificial intelligence technology is more accurate, which makes the value contained in the data more and more important to people. At present, many fields need the opening and sharing of big data, but there is no reliable data sharing environment in the field of food supervision, and it is still difficult to ensure the traceability of data related to food safety. Blockchain has unique advantages of decentralization and distribution, which can help break the current obstacles of big data sharing and exchange and achieve a high degree of data sharing, interconnection and exchange. Based on the blockchain technology, this paper studies the food safety data sharing and exchange mechanism, combines the blockchain with the distributed file system, constructs the data connection model, stores the shared information on the blockchain, then introduces IPFs and zigzag coding, designs the corresponding control method, and establishes a reliable data sharing and exchange mechanism. The analysis shows that the data sharing and exchange mechanism proposed in this paper can meet the needs of food safety data sharing and exchange.},

abstract = {The number of fake news written by bots or malicious actors on social media is rising. One cause is the ability of users to post anything, at any place, at any time. This offers great flexibility, but it also poses the risk that users share misinformation. One type includes events that allegedly have occurred in a location, without the reporting user necessarily having been present. A user may add her location to posts to appear as an eyewitness and thus more trustworthy; however, basing that trust on commonly used and easily faked GPS locations is not reasonable.We present EventChain, which enriches social media posts with hard to fake trust scores based on the user's recent motion profile to give actual eyewitnesses more credibility. Users' motion profiles are integrity- and privacy-preservingly logged in a blockchain. Once the user posts an event, her locality is evaluated for a location rating. The location evaluation is secured by a trusted execution environment to ensure users' location data is private and under the users' control at all times. EventChain also enables interactive assessments of a post via nearby users, whose location is similarly evaluated. This way other eyewitnesses can credibly provide further information, thus leading to a consensus about the event's actual occurrences, increasing trust in social media posts, and limiting the spread of fake news.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) and Blockchain technologies have been utilized heavily in diverse domains, including remote patient monitoring (RPM). Expeditious development of wearable IoT medical devices with a variety of functionality, real-time sensory data from patients can be provided and further processed. IoT data are centrally collected, processed, and stored. But this centralization may face different problems including single-point failure, data tampering, privacy issues, etc. Blockchain can address these problems using its decentralized architecture. Hence, the combination of IoT and blockchain is a plausible solution to design a smart RPM system. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of the existing literature that has integrated blockchain with IoT-based systems from the perspective of remote patient monitoring. We have also proposed comprehensive IoT-blockchain based RPM framework guideline that addresses all aspects of designing an RPM system. Our proposed framework addresses the challenges of IoT-blockchain based systems, fulfills the requirements of real-time remote patient monitoring systems, and integrates the best practices of the literature in the relevant domains.},

However, the computational complexity of encryption process is much higher than that of the decryption process in attribute-based encryption schemes. This paper extends and improves the related work to further achieve outsourcing encryption based on blockchain.

However, the traditional AKA protocol does not allow the micro operator to authenticate mobile users independently. To solve this problem, we propose the Fast AKA protocol, which disseminates a subscriber’s profile among base stations via a Blockchain and mutually authenticates the subscriber and serving base station locally for roaming. The proposed architecture speeds up the authentication process, provides forward/backward secrecy, and resists replay attack as well as man-in-the-middle attack. We believe that Fast AKA can serve as a cornerstone for B5G.},

abstract = {At present, some colleges and universities use the recruitment system to complete the registration and review of candidates in the recruitment work, but the review work still requires reviewers to spend a lot of time to complete. In addition, candidates submit malicious incorrect registration information to disrupt recruitment, which not only increases the workload of reviewers, but also affects the efficiency of recruitment. Candidates need to upload scanned copies of certification materials (such as ID card, degree certificate, graduation certificate, etc.) when registering. Some candidates are worried about whether the information will be leaked and the reviewers are unfair in reviewing for personal gains. In response to these problems, this article proposes to add text recognition to the recruitment management system of a university teacher to complete the system's automatic registration review. Based on the traceability and non-tampering characteristics of blockchain technology, the security and traceability of registration information are guaranteed. Kind of optimization plan. By analyzing the system process, selecting a third-party API interface to complete text recognition, and combining the simple filtering function of the system to build an automated audit function of the system. Select the candidate's registration information as the traceability object, optimize the system process, write smart contracts, web3.js connect the system and the blockchain. Experiments have proved that the automated audit function is automatically executed after candidates submit the registration form, and the average audit speed is 550ms. Reduce the workload of reviewers and improve recruitment efficiency. If the candidate has questions about the review process, the candidate can retrospectively verify whether the registration information has been tampered with through the blockchain, which ensures the fairness of the recruitment work.},

The possibility to make calls to another contract or exchange cryptocurrency allows for potential exploits to occur, most notable reentrancy. The Solidity language for coding smart contracts has syntactic constructs created to be safer alternatives, and guards to aid in securing code against exploits. In this paper, we collect a total of 26,799 verified Solidity smart contracts from Etherscan, to analyze the language constructs used in calling another contract or exchanging ether. We also analyze the usage of guards to make the code more secure. For instance, even though call is the unsafest function, it is still used by 50% of the contracts in our dataset. The safe method transfer is used by approximately one-third of contracts, and send is rarely used. We noticed that contracts using call have a higher average and median size in Lines of Code than normal. We also found an increased percentage of call contracts using more guards. Moreover, 97% of all contracts are using the require guard, with 23 uses of require on average per contract. This may be an indication that Solidity developers are using more guards to prevent exploits in their contracts},

abstract = {The purpose of a reputation system is to hold the users of a distributed application accountable for their behavior. The reputation of a user is computed as an aggregate of the feedback provided by fellow users in the system. Truthful feedback is clearly a prerequisite for computing a reputation score that accurately represents the behavior of a user. However, it has been observed that users can hesitate in providing truthful feedback because, for example, of fear of retaliation. Privacy-preserving reputation systems enable users to provide feedback in a private and thus uninhibited manner. In this survey, we propose analysis frameworks for privacy-preserving reputation systems. We use these analysis frameworks to review and compare the existing approaches. Emphasis is placed on blockchain-based systems as they are a recent significant development in the area. Blockchain-based privacy-preserving reputation systems have properties, such as trustlessness, transparency, and immutability, which prior systems do not have. Our analysis provides several insights and directions for future research. These include leveraging blockchain to its full potential in order to develop truly trustless systems, to achieve some important security properties, and to include defenses against common attacks that have so far not been addressed by most current systems.},

Initial approaches attempt to solve this problem by using centralised systems with trusted authorities. However, sharing vaccine passport data between different organisations, regions and countries has become a major challenge. A platform for creating, storing and verifying digital COVID-19 vaccine certifications is presented, making use of InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to guarantee that there is no single point of failure and to allow data to be securely distributed globally. Blockchain and smart contracts are also integrated into the platform to explicitly determine policies and log access rights to the passport data while ensuring all actions are audited and verifiably immutable. Our proposed platform realises General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements in terms of user consent, data encryption, data erasure and accountability obligations. We assess the scalability and performance of the platform using IPFS and Blockchain test networks.},

abstract = {Smart grids leverage the data collected from smart meters to make important operational decisions. However, they are vulnerable to False Data Injection (FDI) attacks in which an attacker manipulates meter data to disrupt the grid operations. Existing works on FDI are based on a simple threat model in which a single grid operator has access to all the data, and only some meters can be compromised.Our goal is to secure smart grids against FDI under a realistic threat model. To this end, we present a threat model in which there are multiple operators, each with a partial view of the grid, and each can be fully compromised. An effective defense against FDI in this setting is to share data between the operators. However, the main challenge here is to incentivize data sharing. We address this by proposing an incentive mechanism that rewards operators for uploading data, but penalizes them if the data is missing or anomalous. We derive formal conditions under which our incentive mechanism is provably secure against operators who withhold or distort measurement data for profit. We then implement the data sharing solution on a private blockchain, introducing several optimizations that overcome the inherent performance limitations of the blockchain. Finally, we conduct an experimental evaluation that demonstrates that our implementation has practical performance.},

abstract = {As transaction fees skyrocket today, blockchains become increasingly expensive, hurting their adoption in broader applications. This work tackles the saving of transaction fees for economic blockchain applications. The key insight is that other than the existing "default'' mode to execute application logic fully on-chain, i.e., in smart contracts, and in fine granularity, i.e., user request per transaction, there are alternative execution modes with advantages in cost-effectiveness. On Ethereum, we propose a holistic middleware platform supporting flexible and secure transaction executions, including off-chain states and batching of user requests. Furthermore, we propose control-plane schemes to adapt the execution mode to the current workload for optimal runtime cost. We present a case study on the institutional accounts (e.g., coinbase.com) intensively sending Ether on Ethereum blockchains. By collecting real-life transactions, we construct workload benchmarks and show that our work saves 18%sim 47%18%-47% per invocation than the default baseline while introducing 1.81%sim 16.59%1.81%-16.59% blocks delay.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of online education, the security sharing of digital education resources has become a hot topic. Blockchain technology is difficult to be tampered with, decentralized and other characteristics, suitable for protecting the copyright of digital education resources, but the on-chain data is transparent and open, there are hidden dangers of on-chain data security. Secondly, blockchain has limited storage capacity and is not suitable for storing a large number of digital educational resources. The education resource access control model proposed in this paper combines distributed file system with blockchain, which stores the summary information of education resource data. Based on the one-to-many sharing scenario of digital education resources, Ciphertext-Policy Attribute Based Encryption is adopted to implements fine-grained access control. Based on the storage demand of massive education data, IPFS is used to distribute all kinds of digital education resource files to share the storage pressure of blockchain.},

As any other requirements specification, contracts may contain errors and violate properties expected by contracting parties. Symboleo was recently proposed as a formal specification language for legal contracts. This paper presents SymboleoPC, a tool for analyzing Symboleo contracts using model checking. It highlights the architecture, implementation and testing of the tool, as well as a scalability evaluation with respect to the size of contracts and properties to be checked through a series of experiments. The results suggest that SymboleoPC can be usefully applied to the analysis of formal specifications of contracts with real-life sizes and structures.},

abstract = {In a blockchain-based system, the lack of centralized control requires active participation and cooperative behaviors of system entities to ensure system security and sustainability. However, dynamic environments and unpredictable entity behaviors challenge the performances of such systems in practice. Therefore, designing a feasible incentive mechanism to regulate entity behaviors becomes essential to improve blockchain system performance. The prosperous characteristics of blockchain can also contribute to an effective incentive mechanism. Unfortunately, current literature still lacks a thorough survey on incentive mechanisms related to the blockchain to understand how incentive mechanisms and blockchain make each other better. To this end, we propose evaluation requirements in terms of the properties and costs of incentive mechanisms. On the one hand, we provide a taxonomy of the incentive mechanisms of blockchain systems according to blockchain versions, incentive forms, and incentive goals. On the other hand, we categorize blockchain-based incentive mechanisms according to application scenarios and incentive goals. During the review, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of state-of-the-art incentive mechanisms based on the proposed evaluation requirements. Through careful review, we present how incentive mechanisms and blockchain benefit with each other, discover a number of unresolved issues, and point out corresponding potential directions for future research.},

abstract = {The prosperity of decentralized finance motivates many investors to profit via trading their crypto assets on decentralized applications (DApps for short) of the Ethereum ecosystem. Apart from Ether (the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum), many ERC20 (a widely used token standard on Ethereum) tokens obtain vast market value in the ecosystem. Specifically, the approval mechanism is used to delegate the privilege of spending users’ tokens to DApps. By doing so, the DApps can transfer these tokens to arbitrary receivers on behalf of the users. To increase the usability, unlimited approval is commonly adopted by DApps to reduce the required interaction between them and their users. However, as shown in existing security incidents, this mechanism can be abused to steal users’ tokens. In this paper, we present the first systematic study to quantify the risk of unlimited approval of ERC20 tokens on Ethereum. Specifically, by evaluating existing transactions up to 31st July 2021, we find that unlimited approval is prevalent (60%, 15.2M/25.4M) in the ecosystem, and 22% of users have a high risk of their approved tokens for stealing. After that, we investigate the security issues that are involved in interacting with the UIs of 22 representative DApps and 9 famous wallets to prepare the approval transactions. The result reveals the worrisome fact that all DApps request unlimited approval from the front-end users and only 10% (3/31) of UIs provide explanatory information for the approval mechanism. Meanwhile, only 16% (5/31) of UIs allow users to modify their approval amounts. Finally, we take a further step to characterize the user behavior into five modes and formalize the good practice, i.e., on-demand approval and timely spending, towards securely spending approved tokens. However, the evaluation result suggests that only 0.2% of users follow the good practice to mitigate the risk. Our study sheds light on the risk of unlimited approval and provides suggestions to secure the approval mechanism of the ERC20 tokens on Ethereum.},

However, the drawbacks of centralized storage, data leakage risk, and the lack of trust mechanisms among entities exposed by traditional data sharing models have seriously reduced users' willingness to share data and hindered the maximization of data value. Blockchain technology, which has emerged and gradually popularized, provides new ideas for secure data sharing by virtue of its decentralization, traceability, trustlessness and programmability, but a series of problems such as compatibility, performance, security and privacy have also brought serious challenges to it. According to the research results in recent years, we conduct an overview of the layered technology architecture of blockchain-based secure data sharing model by particularly emphasizing on the distributed storage technology, data sharing mechanisms and associated cryptography algorithms. And we also expound the challenges faced by the current research as well as the prospect of future research directions.},

This topic studies the design of transmission line allocation algorithm based on blockchain. This paper considers a power communication network scenario using blockchain technology, which includes a power cloud platform and edge servers. In the process of scheduling storage resources, this paper mainly defines resource scheduling preferences according to resource reliability, resource confidence, storage performance and network cost. The research shows that the algorithm in this paper will choose to upload some high-priority and large-scale services, which affects the delay optimization, but compared with the delay optimization algorithm, its delay is only about 0.051s worse. Some nodes join the core nodes, thus increasing the transmission cost, but the core ratio keeps increasing, and the transmission costs of the two nodes are balanced and reach the maximum value.},

In a VCS infrastructure, sensing devices and computing units hold on smart cars as well as cloud server form an IoT-edge-cloud continuum to perform real-time sensing tasks. In order to encourage the smart cars to participate the real-time VCS process, blockchain technology can be combined with VCS to provide automated incentive for VCS data trading without relying on trusted third parties. However, directly using blockchain to enforce VCS data trading process incurs expensive service fees and participants still can conduct various misbehavior. In this paper, we propose a secure blockchain-based data trading system for VCS named BTT system to address the above issues. In particular, we first integrate the blockchain-based data trading process with a lightweight privacy-preserving truth discovery algorithm to ensure the accuracy of sensing data while preserving data privacy. we then propose a gas-aware optimization mechanism to minimize the gas consumption of the data trading process. Finally, we carefully design a distributed judgment mechanism to regulate all participants to behave correctly in the data trading process. To demonstrate the practicability of our design, we implement a prototype of BTT system deployed on Ethereum test network and conduct extensive simulations.},

Reliable machine-to-machine automatic transactions, such as auctions, bidding, and payments, utilise the immense potential of blockchain technology. Researchers are exploring blockchain-based applications for automobiles and transportation, such as electric vehicle (EV) charging and highway user fee payment. The use of blockchain eliminates the need for third parties in transactions. This paper presents a proof of concept for using EVs as energy storage in a smart grid system. Generators, consumers, and distributed energy resources (DER), such as solar and wind, make up the elements of a smart grid. We propose storing the surplus power generated by DER in the electric vehicle's battery. When the generation is less, or there is high demand, these EVs can supply the stored energy back to the grid. We use blockchain smart contracts and Ethereum cryptocurrency to monitor and monetise the process. We also make a cost comparison of conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and EVs, analysing the financial benefits of employing the suggested method in EV charging instead of more conventional charging methods.},

abstract = {A blockchain is a form of distributed ledger technology where transactions as data state changes are permanently recorded securely and transparently without the need for third parties. Besides, introducing smart contracts to the blockchain has added programmability, revolutionizing the software ecosystem toward decentralized applications. Although promising, the usability of smart contracts is primarily limited to on-chain data without access to the external systems (i.e., off-chain) where real-world data and events reside. This connectability to off-chain data for smart contracts and blockchain is an open practical problem referred to as the “oracle problem” and is defined as how real-world data can be transferred into/from the blockchain. Hence, Blockchain oracles are introduced and implemented in the form of application programming interfaces connecting the real world to the blockchain for mitigating such a limitation. This article studies and analyzes how blockchain oracles provide final feedback (i.e., outcome) to smart contracts and survey blockchain oracle technologies and mechanisms regarding data integrity and correctness. Since the existing solutions are extensive in terms of characteristics and usage, we investigate their structure and principles by classifying the blockchain oracle implementation techniques into two major groups voting-based strategies and reputation-based ones. The former mainly relies on participants’ stakes for outcome finalization, while the latter considers reputation and performance metrics in conjunction with authenticity-proof mechanisms for data correctness and integrity. We present the result of this classification with a thorough discussion of the state of the art and provide the remaining challenges and future research directions in the end.},

abstract = {The blockchain-powered decentralized applications and systems have been widely deployed in recent years. The decentralization feature promises users anonymity, security, and non-censorship, which is especially welcomed in the areas of decentralized finance and digital assets. From the perspective of most common users, a decentralized ecosystem means every service follows the principle of decentralization. However, we find that the services in a decentralized ecosystem still may contain centralized components or scenarios, like third-party SDKs and privileged operations, which violate the promise of decentralization and may cause a series of centralized security risks. In this work, we systematically study the centralized security risks existing in decentralized ecosystems. Specifically, we identify seven centralized security risks in the deployment of two typical decentralized services – crypto wallets and DApps, such as anonymity loss and overpowered owner. Also, to measure these risks in the wild, we designed an automated detection tool called Naga and carried out large-scale experiments. Based on the measurement of 28 Ethereum crypto wallets (Android version) and 110,506 on-chain smart contracts, the result shows that the centralized security risks are widespread. Up to 96.4% of wallets and 83.5% of contracts exist at least one security risk, including 260 well-known tokens with a total market cap of over $98 billion.},

Cross-enterprise document sharing (XDS) is the crucial system of sharing personalized healthcare data. Furthermore, dynamic consent is vital to the XDS system, because it respects people's autonomy and achieves recognition of data sovereignty. Because of its transparency, blockchain is a powerful system for managing storage and computing without a trusted third party. Besides, ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) extends public-key encryption by implying access control policies in ciphertexts, making it suitable for protecting the privacy of individual healthcare data in versatile cases. Particularly, we use hospital name, "date" and "department" as attribute strings in the access control policies. Consequently, based on consortium blockchain and CP-ABE, we propose a patient-centered XDS and a dynamic consent framework. Compared with previous related literature, we make the proposed framework consistent with current practices and achieve favorable criteria, such as data confidentiality, data recoverability and time-aware ciphertext. Further, we conduct comprehensive experiments to show the feasibility and practicality.},

The medical metadata is stored on the blockchain, and the medical data block is stored in InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). In each consortium blockchain, a small number of authoritative organizations are selected to form a main chain, which is responsible for the cross chain query function among the consortium blockchains.

abstract = {We propose a method to protect ownership of specified areas on image data using blockchain. Different values are assigned corresponding to the object's importance in the region and the ownership of the area is managed and given to the required user. The detected areas are individually encrypted by XOR cipher, and a corresponding key image is created to decrypt to protect ownership of selected object regions detected by the object recognition algorithm. We use non-fungible tokens(NFTs) to secure key images by managing ownership of each object on image data. Key images to decrypt are registered as NFTs. Ownership NFTs are also created to access and retrieve the key image NFTs. Each key image NFT is generated by key holders and ownership NFTs are obtained by users requiring them. In addition, there is a judging function that clarifies if ownership and key NFTs match. Key NFTs appear on the screen only when they are matched.With this method, we can give different value to partial areas of image and ensure ownership of them. Besides, ownership can be transferred and shared with multiple people. Furthermore, original image holders can get financial profit depending on how valuable the images are. Lastly, this method would improve securing image data.},

abstract = {Federated learning is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique that trains models across multiple devices holding local data samples without exchanging them. There are many challenging issues in federated learning, such as coordinating participants’ activities, arbitrating their benefits, and aggregating models. Most existing solutions employ a centralized approach, in which a trustworthy central authority is needed for coordination. Such an approach incurs many disadvantages, including vulnerability to attacks, lack of credibility, and difficulty in calculating rewards. Recently, blockchain was identified as a potential solution for addressing the abovementioned issues. Extensive research has been conducted, and many approaches, methods, and techniques have been proposed. There is a need for a systematic survey to examine how blockchain can empower federated learning. Although there are many surveys on federated learning, few of them cover blockchain as an enabling technology. This work comprehensively surveys challenges, solutions, and future directions for blockchain-empowered federated learning (BlockFed). First, we identify the critical issues in federated learning and explain why blockchain provides a potential approach to addressing these issues. Second, we categorize existing system models into three classes: decoupled, coupled, and overlapped, according to how the federated learning and blockchain functions are integrated. Then we compare the advantages and disadvantages of these three system models, regard the disadvantages as challenging issues in BlockFed, and investigate corresponding solutions. Finally, we identify and discuss the future directions, including open problems in BlockFed.},

abstract = {We present LedgerView -- a system that adds access control views to permissioned blockchains. The approach is motivated by an AT&amp;T application of tracking refurbished devices. A blockchain is a decentralized tamper-resistant ledger managed by a group of peers. It is used in many applications for storing and sharing sensitive information, e.g., monetary transactions, health records, personal documents, etc. But in blockchain, all the peers see all the stored transactions, while in some applications, access to sensitive information should be limited, that is, concealed from peers and users who do not have proper access permissions. In database management systems, sets of records that are visible to some users and concealed from others are defined by views, but existing blockchain systems lack such access-control capabilities. Thus, in this paper, we introduce access-control views for Hyperledger Fabric. We present two types of views -- irrevocable and revocable, according to whether access to sensitive information can or cannot be revoked. We explain how to implement the two types of view by using cryptographic hash functions and encryption keys, and we show how to support Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Experiments with supply chain transactions illustrate the incurred costs of the views in LedgerView, including latency, transaction rate and storage overhead.},

abstract = {With the recent advent of blockchains, we have witnessed a plethora of blockchain proposals. These proposals range from using work to using time, storage or stake in order to select blocks to be appended to the chain. As a drawback it makes it difficult for the application developer to choose the right blockchain to support their applications. In particular, the scalability and performance one can obtain from a specific blockchain is typically unknown. The claimed results are often obtained in isolation by the developers of the blockchain themselves. The experimental conditions corresponding to these results are generally missing and the lack of details make these results irreproducible.In this paper, we propose the most extensive evaluation of blockchain to date. First, we show how the experimental settings impact the performance of 6 state-of-the-art blockchains and argue for more detailed experiments. Second, and to cope with this limitation, we propose a unifying framework to evaluate blockchains on the same ground. The framework includes a suite of 5 realistic Decentralized Applications (DApps), helps deploy the blockchain nodes at different scales and evaluate their performance. Finally, we show that selecting a particular virtual machine or weakening guarantees can help handle computationally demanding workloads but that none of the tested blockchains can yet support the load of these realistic DApps.},

Nevertheless, there are some serious concerns about the trustworthiness of blockchain due to the vulnerabilities in on-chain algorithmic mechanisms, and tedious disputes and debates in off-chain communities. Accordingly, blockchain governance has received great attention for improving the trustworthiness of all decisions that direct a blockchain platform. However, there is a lack of systematic knowledge to guide practitioners to perform blockchain governance. We have performed a systematic literature review to understand the state-of-the-art of blockchain governance. We identify the lifecycle stages of a blockchain platform, and present 14 architectural patterns for blockchain governance in this study. This pattern language can provide guidance for the effective use of patterns for blockchain governance in practice, and support the architecture design of governance-driven blockchain systems.},

abstract = {Blockchains have seen growing traction with cryptocurrencies reaching a market cap of over 1 trillion dollars, major institution investors taking interests, and global impacts on governments, businesses, and individuals. Also growing significantly is the heterogeneity of the ecosystem where a variety of blockchains co-exist. Cross-chain bridge is a necessary building block in this multi-chain ecosystem. Existing solutions, however, either suffer from performance issues or rely on honesty assumptions of committees that significantly lower the security. Recurring attacks against bridges have cost users more than 1.5 billion USD. In this paper, we introduce zkBridge, an efficient cross-chain bridge that guarantees strong security without extra trust assumptions. With succinct proofs, zkBridge not only guarantees correctness, but also significantly reduces on-chain verification cost. We propose novel succinct proof protocols that are orders-of-magnitude faster than existing solutions for workload in zkBridge. With a modular design, zkBridge enables a few useful capabilities, including message passing, token transferring, and other computational logic operating on state changes from different chains. We fully implemented zkBridge between Cosmos and Ethereum and evaluated the end-to-end performance. The experiment shows that zkBridge achieves practical performance: it can generate a block header proof within 2 minutes, while verifying proofs on-chain costs less than 220K gas (the same as Groth16). Relaying a transaction from Cosmos to Ethereum costs 210K gas.},

abstract = {Blockchain, as a distributed ledger technology, becomes increasingly popular, especially for enabling valuable cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. However, the blockchain software systems inevitably have many bugs. Although bugs in smart contracts have been extensively investigated, security bugs of the underlying blockchain systems are much less explored. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on blockchain’s system vulnerabilities from four representative blockchains, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, and Stellar. Specifically, we first design a systematic filtering process to effectively identify 1,037 vulnerabilities and their 2,317 patches from 34,245 issues/PRs (pull requests) and 85,164 commits on GitHub. We thus build the first blockchain vulnerability dataset, which is available at https://github.com/VPRLab/BlkVulnDataset. We then perform unique analyses of this dataset at three levels, including (i) file-level vulnerable module categorization by identifying and correlating module paths across projects, (ii) text-level vulnerability type clustering by natural language processing and similarity-based sentence clustering, and (iii) code-level vulnerability pattern analysis by generating and clustering code change signatures that capture both syntactic and semantic information of patch code fragments. Our analyses reveal three key findings: (i) some blockchain modules are more susceptible than the others; notably, each of the modules related to consensus, wallet, and networking has over 200 issues; (ii) about 70% of blockchain vulnerabilities are of traditional types, but we also identify four new types specific to blockchains; and (iii) we obtain 21 blockchain-specific vulnerability patterns that capture unique blockchain attributes and statuses, and demonstrate that they can be used to detect similar vulnerabilities in other popular blockchains, such as Dogecoin, Bitcoin SV, and Zcash.},

abstract = {In the present academic landscape, the process of collecting data is slow, and the lax infrastructures for data collaborations lead to significant delays in coming up with and disseminating conclusive findings. Therefore, there is an increasing need for a secure, scalable, and trustworthy data-sharing ecosystem that promotes and rewards collaborative data-sharing efforts among researchers, and a robust incentive mechanism is required to achieve this objective. Reputation-based incentives, such as the h-index, have historically played a pivotal role in the academic community. However, the h-index suffers from several limitations. This paper introduces the SCIENCE-index, a blockchain-based metric measuring a researcher’s scientific contributions. Utilizing the Microsoft Academic Graph and machine learning techniques, the SCIENCE-index predicts the progress made by a researcher over their career and provides a soft incentive for sharing their datasets with peer researchers. To incentivize researchers to share their data, the SCIENCE-index is augmented to include a data-sharing parameter. DataCite, a database of openly available datasets, proxies this parameter, which is further enhanced by including a researcher’s data-sharing activity. Our model is evaluated by comparing the distribution of its output for geographically diverse researchers to that of the h-index. We observe that it results in a much more even spread of evaluations. The SCIENCE-index is a crucial component in constructing a decentralized protocol that promotes trust-based data sharing, addressing the current inequity in dataset sharing. The work outlined in this paper provides the foundation for assessing scientific contributions in future data-sharing spaces powered by decentralized applications.},

News reports frequently bear witness to scams, hacked exchanges, and fortunes beyond retrieval. However, we lack a systematic understanding of user-centered cryptocurrency threats, as causes leading to loss are scattered across publications. To address this gap, we conducted a focus group (n=6) and an expert elicitation study (n=25) following a three-round Delphi process with a heterogeneous group of blockchain and security experts from academia and industry. We contribute the first systematic overview of threats cryptocurrency users are exposed to and propose six overarching categories. Our work is complemented by a discussion on how the human-computer-interaction community can address these threats and how practitioners can use the model to understand situations in which users might find themselves under the pressure of an attack to ultimately engineer more secure systems.},

A four-layer structure model is designed, and the interaction between server, IPFS and Fabric is defined. The semi-structured interview evaluation of participants confirmed that the scheme could improve the availability, reliability and efficiency of the e-resource sharing platform.

abstract = {Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) has been extensively applied in various types of conditional access control systems since its introduction because of its ability to provide fine-grained and flexible access control to confidential data, thus offering a safe and effective data sharing environment. However, while developing rapidly, the existing CP-ABE access schemes also face some problems, such as trustworthiness issues involving third-party intermediary entities, secret key management problems brought by single attribute authorization centers, and privacy leakage of attributes. How to achieve safe and effective decentralized access control has been a problem to be explored and solved. In this paper, a trustworthy, secure, and efficient ABE(TSE ABE) based on blockchain and fast attribute-based message encryption (FAME) is proposed by us. First, we combine blockchain and FAME and optimize them to make CP-ABE perform better. Second, we implement a trusted authorization model with multiple entities based on the BLS signature and smart contracts to address key privacy issues. Finally, we protect the privacy of attributes in the authorization matching process by RSA encryption algorithm. Through the experimental results, it can be found that the scheme not only has good security and execution performance but also achieves effective protection of user privacy.},

abstract = {Web3, based on blockchain technology, is the evolving next generation Internet of value. Massive active applications on Web3, e.g. DeFi and NFT, usually rely on blockchain transactions to achieve value transfer as well as complex and diverse custom logic and intentions. Various risky or illegal behaviors such as financial fraud, hacking, money laundering are currently rampant in the blockchain ecosystem, and it is thus important to understand the intent behind the pseudonymous transactions. To reveal the intent of transactions, much effort has been devoted to extracting some particular transaction semantics through specific expert experiences. However, the limitations of existing methods in terms of effectiveness and generalization make it difficult to extract diverse transaction semantics in the rapidly growing and evolving Web3 ecosystem. In this paper, we propose the Motif-based Transaction Semantics representation method (MoTS), which can capture the transaction semantic information in the real-time transaction data workflow. To the best of our knowledge, MoTS is the first general semantic extraction method in Web3 blockchain ecosystem. Experimental results show that MoTS can effectively distinguish different transaction semantics in real-time, and can be used for various downstream tasks, giving new insights to understand the Web3 blockchain ecosystem. Our codes are available at https://github.com/wuzhy1ng/MoTS.},

abstract = {In order to protect data privacy in the context of big data, a new scheme to protect data privacy and user privacy is proposed. This study believes that blockchain technology can be used to build a massive private data retrieval and sharing platform, considering the realization of privacy protection under horizontal federated learning and vertical federated learning, combined with privacy computing technology, to verify the results of massive data retrieval, and to build a "data availability that is not available." The "visible" security reduction model involves three cryptographic algorithms, namely functional encryption, zero-knowledge proof and asymmetric encryption. By combining blockchain and cloud servers, a hybrid storage architecture with data storage on the chain and off-chain storage is realized. And use function encryption and zero-knowledge proof to achieve privacy protection and secure data sharing of verifiable results. The final experimental results prove that the security feasibility of this model is proposed in this paper, which can fully improve the level of data log security management, operation and maintenance supervision, and the quality and efficiency of data security protection, and improve the network security protection system of the power grid in all scenarios.},

abstract = {Blockchain systems are challenged by the so-called Trilemma tradeoff: decentralization, scalability, and security. Infrastructure and node configuration, choice of the Consensus Protocol, and complexity of the application transactions are cited among the factors that affect the tradeoff balance. Given that Blockchains are complex, dynamic systems, a dynamic approach to their management and reconfiguration at runtime is deemed necessary to reflect the changes in the state of the infrastructure and application. This paper introduces the utilization of DigitalTwins for this purpose. The novel contribution of the paper is the design of a framework and conceptual architecture of a Digital Twin that can assist in maintaining the Trilemma tradeoffs of time-critical systems. The proposed Digital Twin is illustrated via an innovative approach to the dynamic selection of Consensus Protocols. Simulation results show that the proposed framework can effectively support the dynamic adaptation and management of the Blockchain.},

Doing so is trivial if the mechanism is allowed to observe all actions taken in the game, as this allows it to simply punish those agents who deviate from the intended strategy. Instead, we consider an abstraction where the mechanism probabilistically infers information about the outcome of the game. We show that payment schemes can be used to implement any set of utilities if and only if the mechanism can essentially infer completely what happened. We show that finding an optimal payment scheme for games of perfect information is P-complete, and conjecture it to be PPAD-hard for games of imperfect information. We prove a lower bound on the size of the payments, showing that the payments must be linear in the intended level of security. We demonstrate the applicability of our model to concrete problems in distributed computing, namely decentralized commerce and secure multiparty computation, for which the payments match the lower bound asymptotically.},

This paper proposes a data privacy protection and fingerprint tracing method based on the features of decentralization, traceability and non-tampering in blockchain technology. And we combined with the protection of data by secure network platform in trusted computing and differential-traceability algorithm (DTA). We propose a data privacy protection and fingerprint traceability method, and use the SkipList table index structure to improve interaction efficiency.

In this paper, the data can be processed safely and efficiently to solve the privacy problem, the transaction data is encrypted and recorded on the chain by DTA, and the interaction process uses the SkipList table index to enhance retrieval efficiency. Finally, through multiple experiments and comparison of the results obtained from security testing, it is verified that the blockchain-trusted computing data privacy protection and data fingerprint traceability SkipList table indexing method can achieve traceability for data privacy protection, transaction security management and peer-to-peer verification of encryption and decryption algorithms.

abstract = {Blockchain, a potentially disruptive technology, advances many different applications, e.g., crypto-currencies, supply chains, and the Internet of Things. Under the hood of blockchain, it is required to handle different kinds of digital assets and data. The next-generation blockchain ecosystem is expected to consist of numerous applications, and each application may have a distinct representation of digital assets. However, digital assets cannot be directly recorded on the blockchain, and a tokenization process is required to format these assets. Tokenization on blockchain will inevitably require a certain level of proper standards to enrich advanced functionalities and enhance interoperable capabilities for future applications. However, due to specific features of digital assets, it is hard to obtain a standard token form to represent all kinds of assets. For example, when considering fungibility, some assets are divisible and identical, commonly referred to as fungible assets. In contrast, others that are not fungible are widely referred to as non-fungible assets. When tokenizing these assets, we are required to follow different tokenization processes. The way to effectively tokenize assets is thus essential and expecting to confront various unprecedented challenges. This paper provides a systematic and comprehensive study of the current progress of tokenization on blockchain. First, we explore general principles and practical schemes to tokenize digital assets for blockchain and classify digitized tokens into three categories: fungible, non-fungible, and semi-fungible. We then focus on discussing the well-known Ethereum standards on non-fungible tokens. Finally, we discuss several critical challenges and some potential research directions to advance the research on exploring the tokenization process on the blockchain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study for tokenization on blockchain.},

abstract = {Location and user information can be shared and interacted in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), which bring many benefits to drivers and consumers. However, private issues become more acute as their data is outsourced to third parties. It is easy for sensitive information to be leaked in a big data environment. To solve these problems, a location data algorithm that satisfies Local Differential Privacy (LDP) is proposed to protect user privacy. In this paper, we use the randomized response mechanism to reconstruct the Laplace algorithm so that it satisfies LDP, perturbing the original location of each user from the client. The user location is clustered using k-means clustering algorithm, the perturbed data are noise reduced in the blockchain software development kit (SDK), and the noise reduced location data is uploaded to the blockchain network for storage through smart contracts. In addition, the effectiveness of the privacy protection mechanism is verified by comparative experiments. Compared with the existing privacy protection methods, the privacy protection mechanism not only can meet the privacy needs of users better, but also the noise reduction algorithm in the SDK can restore the original data and has higher data availability.},

abstract = {As an integral part of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) with automated market maker (AMM) protocols have gained massive traction with the recently revived interest in blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) in general. Instead of matching the buy and sell sides, automated market makers (AMMs) employ a peer-to-pool method and determine asset price algorithmically through a so-called conservation function. To facilitate the improvement and development of AMM-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs), we create the first systematization of knowledge in this area. We first establish a general AMM framework describing the economics and formalizing the system’s state-space representation. We then employ our framework to systematically compare the top AMM protocols’ mechanics, illustrating their conservation functions, as well as slippage and divergence loss functions. We further discuss security and privacy concerns, how they are enabled by AMM-based DEXs’ inherent properties, and explore mitigating solutions. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive literature review on related work covering both DeFi and conventional market microstructure.},

However, the transparency of blockchain networks and the open mechanism of DeFi applications also cause new security issues. In this paper, we focus on sandwich attacks, where attackers take advantage of the transaction confirmation delay and cause financial losses for victims. We evaluate the impact and investigate users’ perceptions of sandwich attacks through a mix-method study. We find that due to users’ lack of technical background and insufficient notifications from the markets, many users were not aware of the existence and the impact of sandwich attacks. They also had a limited understanding of how to resolve the security issue. Interestingly, users showed high tolerance for the impact of sandwich attacks on individuals and the ecosystem, despite potential financial losses. We discuss general implications for users, DeFi applications, and the community.},

abstract = {Laboratories produce large amounts of data for scientific experiments and management. However, traditional paper recording methods were lost easily and managed difficultly. Paper files took up a lot of space. Even worse, the contents of the document could be easily manipulated. In recent years, with a growing number of experimental projects cooperation between universities and enterprises, many problems have emerged, such as the ownership of experimental data is not clear, and, the data transmitted online is easily leaked. Considering these problems, this study proposes to use data architecture to manage laboratories relevant data. This means that valuable data needs to be protected, packaged and traded as products. DOSA is a data-centric architecture. The advantage of DOSA is that it binds data and ownership together, protects data with key technologies, and enables secure sharing. This research designs the whole transaction process of experimental data products based on DOSA. In this process, all experimental data is protected by encryption technology to ensure its security. This paper proposes a data architecture as a platform to package experimental data into data products for trading and prevent experimental data fraud from the source. Through the SM2 algorithm and the toolbox Gmssl, the problem of data leakage is solved in the process of data product transaction, and the safe circulation and transaction of laboratory data is realized. After using the Python language to encrypt the laboratory data with the tools provided by the data architecture, it can realize the safe and cross-domain sharing of data off the platform.},

abstract = {Blockchains are a specific type of distributed ledgers structured by a sequence of blocks of transactional data linked to each other. The use of blockchains has increased over time, and several new blockchains are emerging. It is therefore essential to enhance the interoperability between blockchain implementations to allow decentralised trading. One way to achieve this is with Cross-Chain Swap protocols. These protocols are critical systems as they handle assets. Therefore, it must be sure that the system does not contain errors. In this paper, we describe the Cross-Chain Swap problem in a formal way. We define safety and weak-liveness properties that guarantee no correct participant will be worse-off in an asynchronous system. Moreover, we provide a formally proved Byzantine fault-tolerant protocol that satisfies the swap specification. The protocol abstracts the blockchain enough to suit various distributed ledger frameworks aiming to perform a cross-chain swap. In addition, we illustrate how the described abstract protocol can be instantiated in a blockchain system.},

However, most of the existing platforms do not take confidentiality into account, although privacy has become an important concern for blockchain. In this paper, we present TrustCross, a privacy- preserving cross-chain platform to enable confidential interoperability across blockchains. The key insight behind TrustCross is to encrypt cross-chain communication data on the relay chain with the assistance of trusted execution environment and employ fine-grained access control to protect user privacy.

abstract = {Blockchain-based federated learning has gained significant interest over the last few years with the increasing concern for data privacy, advances in machine learning, and blockchain innovation. However, gaps in security and scalability hinder the development of real-world applications. In this study, we propose ScaleSFL, which is a scalable blockchain-based sharding solution for federated learning. ScaleSFL supports interoperability by separating the off-chain federated learning component in order to verify model updates instead of controlling the entire federated learning flow. We implemented ScaleSFL as a proof-of-concept prototype system using Hyperledger Fabric to demonstrate the feasibility of the solution. We present a performance evaluation of results collected through Hyperledger Caliper benchmarking tools conducted on model creation. Our evaluation results show that sharding can improve validation performance linearly while remaining efficient and secure.},

abstract = {In order to solve the problems of controllable load scheduling in the context of the development of distributed power trading mechanism, a decentralized transaction mode between controllable load users and load agents based on block chain technology was proposed. By integrating the operation characteristics of controllable load users and fully considering the purchasing and selling electricity demand information between different subclasses of users and load agents, two types of decision model functions of controllable load users and load agents are designed. Based on the basic principle of income optimization, a block chain node model is established considering operation and maintenance cost and operation efficiency. Based on the controllable load user-load agent blockchain transaction mode, the profit sharing incentive mechanism and the intelligent contract solving algorithm of the load agent are designed. At the same time, the change rate of the efficiency function of the load agent is proposed as the consensus algorithm, and the structure and operation process of the blockchain data are explained. The results of example analysis show that the proposed optimal scheduling strategy fully taps the potential of controllable load users and load agents for peak load cutting and valley filling of power grid, achieves economic optimization for both parties and guarantees the long-term effective operation of blockchain network, which can provide reference value for the application of blockchain technology in power demand response.},

abstract = {Due to the popularity of smart contracts in the modern financial ecosystem, there has been growing interest in formally verifying their correctness and security properties. Most existing techniques in this space focus on common vulnerabilities like arithmetic overflows and perform verification by leveraging contract invariants (i.e., logical formulas hold at transaction boundaries). In this paper, we propose a new technique, based on deep reinforcement learning, for automatically learning contract invariants that are useful for proving arithmetic safety. Our method incorporates an off-line training phase in which the verifier uses its own verification attempts to learn a policy for contract invariant generation. This learned (neural) policy is then used at verification time to predict likely invariants that are also useful for proving arithmetic safety. We implemented this idea in a tool called Cider and incorporated it into an existing verifier (based on refinement type checking) for proving arithmetic safety. Our evaluation shows that Cider improves both the quality of the inferred invariants as well as inference time, leading to faster verification and hardened contracts with fewer run-time assertions.},

These systems require operations across multiple blockchains to enrich advanced functionalities for future applications. However, the development of blockchain interoperability involves much more complexity regarding the variety of underlying architectures. Guaranteeing the properties of ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) across diverse blockchain systems remains challenging. To clear the fog, this paper accordingly provides a comprehensive review of the current progress of blockchain interoperability. We explore the general principles and procedures for interoperable blockchain systems to highlight their design commons. Then, we survey practical instances and compare state-of-the-art systems to present their unique features between distinct solutions. Finally, we discuss critical challenges and point out potential research directions. We believe our work can provide an intuitive guideline for newcomers and also promote rapid development in terms of blockchain interoperability.},

abstract = {Medical image fusion generates a fused image containing multiple features extracted from different source images, and it is of great help in clinical analysis and diagnosis. However, training a deep learning model for image fusion usually requires enormous computing power, especially for large volumes of medical data. Meanwhile, the privacy of images is also a critical issue. In this article, we propose a privacy-preserving blockchain-based medical image fusion (BMIF) framework. First, to ensure fusion performance, we design a new medical image fusion model based on convolutional neural network and Inception network and integrate the proposed model into the consensus process of blockchain. Next, to save computing power of blockchain, we design a consensus mechanism by requesting consensus nodes to train the fusion model instead of calculating useless hash values in traditional blockchain. Then, to protect data privacy, we further present an efficient homomorphic encryption to realize the training of fusion model on encrypted medical data. Finally, we conduct theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on public datasets to evaluate the feasibility and the performance of our proposed BMIF. The results exhibit that BMIF is efficient and secure, and our medical image fusion network performs better than state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract = {This paper presents a crypto Non Fungible Token (NFT) for real estate information. Current issues with real estate are the lack of asset information availability, and once data is retrieved, its veracity. Moreover, data can be out of data or artificially manipulated for an economic benefit. An example could be the fire alarm inspection logs. On the other hand, the main benefits of tokenisation are 1) decentralisation from a single source of authority, 2) encryption of data that avoids tampering, and 3) digital proof of ownership. The NFT registers real estate static and dynamic information to be traded in the data marketplace between the different users and stakeholders such as investors, occupiers, insurers and property managers. The information registered in the NFT contains real estate deeds, transactions and relevant parameters that change over time. The infrastructure of the proposed real estate NFT consists of a private token in a private blockchain entirely developed for this application rather than ERC-1155 or ERC-721; therefore, a new crypto token is created. Furthermore, the consensus protocol is a mixture between the proof of work and proof of stake mechanisms by choosing random validators with staked Cryptocurrency already, such as Ethereum. Experimental results show that the increment of the NFT at every transaction does not produce an equal increment of mining time or mining nonce, making the NFT predictable for higher complex models.},

abstract = {Enterprise blockchain applications have been widely adopted and the data scale on blockchain increases rapidly in recent years. In practical application, participants prefer to store most of the business data in local database systems and only provide when queried by others due to privacy concerns, high storage cost, or constraints of on-chain space. However, this makes that the integrity of query results cannot be guaranteed and participants cannot fully trust others, and data owner has the opportunity to provide falsified records. In this paper, we present ChainDB, a relational database that can ensure integrity of querying off-chain data on blockchain. The key insight behind is using Merkle B+ tree as index structure, thus has being able to provide Merkle proof and keep all the records in order. Since the index structure is extended on B+ tree, ChainDB is compatible with common SQL operations and it is easy for enterprises to migrate from classic database systems to ChainDB. The experimental results show that ChainDB not only provides the ability to ensure integrity of querying off-chain data on blockchain, but also performs better than existing solutions.},

Studies have shown that developing countries, especially on the African continent, are particularly prone to the commercialization of counterfeit products and the use of diverted consumables, thus reducing the confidence in the various products and services offered by commercial enterprises, not only towards consumers but also towards companies and other actors of the concerned sectors.

Then, we model Hybrid Casper in PRISM+ as a parallel composition of stochastic processes, thus precisely describing the behavior of the protocol and highlighting its corner cases. PRISM+ is therefore used to rapidly and automatically analyze the resilience of Hybrid Casper when tuning, up or down, several basic parameters of the protocol, such as the rates of creating blocks, and the strategies for determining penalties. Finally, we study the robustness of Hybrid Casper to two well-known attacks: the Eclipse attack and the majority attack.},

abstract = {The design of tokenomics, i.e., distribution and circulation mechanisms of cryptocurrency tokens, is a top priority for almost all Web3 applications which relates to their own economic systems via native cryptocurrency tokens. Unfortunately, while the sustainability of tokenomics largely determines the long-term development of a Web3 application, the tooling support for the design of it has been far too insufficient. A common practice at the time of writing is to specify tokenomics with a combination of documents, spreadsheets, code scripts etc.. In this paper, we introduce the TMI development platform for the modelling and analysis of Web3 tokenomics. TMI creates a domain-specific language and its graphical development environment for developers to succinctly model crypto-economic relations in a drag-and-drop way. Based on created models, TMI allows developers to formally analyse their tokenomics via checking fundamental economic properties, e.g., The core team of a project holds less than 20% of the project token in 36 months. A demonstration video of TMI is available at https://youtu.be/LDn-eRxPMTw.},

abstract = {Internet of things(IoT) development tends to reduce the reliance on centralized servers. The zero-trust distributed system combined with blockchain technology has become a hot topic in IoT research. However, distribution data storage services and different blockchain protocols make network interoperability and cross-platform more complex. Relay chain is a promising cross-chain technology that solves the complexity and compatibility issues associated with blockchain cross-chain transactions by utilizing relay blockchains as cross-chain connectors. Yet, relay chain cross-chain transactions need to collect asset information and implement asset transactions via two-way peg. Due to the release of user transaction information, there is the issue of privacy leakage. In this paper, we propose a cross-chain privacy protection protocol based on the Groth16 zero-knowledge proof algorithm and coin-mixing technology, which changes the authentication mechanism and uses a combination of generating functions to map virtual external addresses in transactions. It allows fast cross-chain anonymous transactions while hiding the genuine user’s address. The experiment shows that, in a zero-trust IoT context, our scheme can effectively protect user privacy information, accomplish controlled transaction traceability operations, and guarantee cross-chain transaction security.},

abstract = {In recent years, the confidentiality of smart contracts has become a fundamental requirement for practical applications. While many efforts have been made to develop architectural capabilities for enforcing confidential smart contracts, a few works arise to extend confidential smart contracts to Multi-Party Computation (MPC), i.e., multiple parties jointly evaluate a transaction off-chain and commit the outputs on-chain without revealing their secret inputs/outputs to each other. However, existing solutions lack public verifiability and require O(n) transactions to enable negotiation or resist adversaries, thus suffering from inefficiency and compromised security. In this paper, we propose Cloak, a framework for enabling Multi-Party Transaction (MPT) on existing blockchains. An MPT refers to transitioning blockchain states by an publicly verifiable off-chain MPC. We identify and handle the challenges of securing MPT by harmonizing TEE and blockchain. Consequently, Cloak secures the off-chain nondeterministic negotiation process (a party joins an MPT without knowing identities or the total number of parties until the MPT proposal settles), achieves public verifiability (the public can validate that the MPT correctly handles the secret inputs/outputs from multiple parties and reads/writes states on-chain), and resists Byzantine adversaries. According to our proof, Cloak achieves better security with only 2 transactions, superior to previous works that achieve compromised security at O(n) transactions cost. By evaluating examples and real-world MPTs, the gas cost of Cloak reduces by 32.4% on average.},

abstract = {Donating blood is a common practice that has a positive effect on the lives of several individuals. Daily, the number of people in urgent need of blood continues to rise substantially. It is often challenging to find a suitable donor in case of emergency. The situation is worse if it is a rare blood group. This paper introduces a blockchain-based decentralised application (DApp) to match recipients with blood donors during an emergency. Personal information such as name, location, blood group, and donation history is stored securely in the blockchain distributed ledger through IPFS. The donors' lack of awareness and motivation are the primary reasons for people not coming forward for blood donations. We propose to gamify the blood donation process by issuing NFT badges as a reward for donors. This paper explains the design of smart contracts for storing donor and recipient data on the ledger and issuing NFTs to donors. The article also briefly discusses the process of designing the DApp.},

abstract = {As a new type of digital living space that blends virtual and reality, Metaverse combines many emerging technologies. It provides an immersive experience based on VR technology, and stores and protects users’ digital content and digital assets through blockchain technology. However, different virtual environments are often highly heterogeneous in terms of underlying architecture and software implementation technology, which leads to many challenges in scalability and interoperability for blockchains serving the Metaverse. Cross-chain technology is an essential technology to realize the scalability and interoperability of blockchain. However, the current cross-chain technologies all have their own merits and demerits, and there is no cross-chain solution that can be fully applied to any scenario. To this end, in the blockchain-based Metaverse, this paper proposes a cross-chain transaction scheme based on improved hash timelock, HCNCT. By combining the notary mechanism, this scheme uses a group of notaries to supervise and participate in cross-chain transactions, effectively solving the problem that malicious users create a large number of time-out transactions to block the transaction channel, which exists in the traditional hash timelock method. Besides, this paper uses the verifiable secret sharing method in the notary group, which can effectively prevent the centralization problem of the notary mechanism. Moreover, this paper discusses the process of key processing, cross-chain transaction and transaction verification of the scheme, and designs the user credibility evaluation mechanism, which can effectively reduce the occurrence of malicious default of users. Compared with existing solutions, our solution has the advantage of effectively addressing time-out transaction attacks and centralization issues while guaranteeing security. The experiments also verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

abstract = {Permissionless blockchain consensus protocols have been leveraged for defining decentralized economies for the (commercial or private) trade of virtual and physical assets, using cryptocurrencies. In most instances, the assets being traded are regulated, which mandates that the legal right to their trade and their trade value are determined by the governmental regulator of the jurisdiction in which the trade occurs. Unfortunately, existing blockchains do not formalize proposal of legal cryptocurrency transactions, as part of the execution of their respective consensus protocols, resulting in illegal activities in the associated crypto-economies. In this contribution, unlike existing non-consensus solutions, which are prone to be more compute-time and audit-time intensive, we present a novel regulatory framework for blockchain protocols, for ensuring legal transaction confirmation as part of the blockchain consensus. As per our regulatory framework, we derive, through a stochastic game analysis, block proposal strategies under which legal transaction throughput supersedes throughput of traditional transactions, which are, in the worst case, an indifferentiable mix of legal and illegal transactions. Finally, we show that when a majority of the consensus protocol participants are licensed by the regulator to propose legal transactions, there exists a fair consensus execution policy to maximize the legal transaction throughput in the blockchain network.},

Introduce the concept of Gini coefficient to analyze the centralization of stake of the algorithm.

abstract = {Human genomic data carry unique information about an individual and offer unprecedented opportunities for healthcare. The clinical interpretations derived from large genomic datasets can greatly improve healthcare and pave the way for personalized medicine. Sharing genomic datasets, however, poses major challenges, as genomic data is different from traditional medical data, indirectly revealing information about descendants and relatives of the data owner and carrying valid information even after the owner passes away. Therefore, stringent data ownership and control measures are required when dealing with genomic data. In order to provide a secure and accountable infrastructure, blockchain technologies offer a promising alternative to traditional distributed systems. Indeed, the research on blockchain-based infrastructures tailored to genomics is on the rise. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive literature review that summarizes the current state-of-the-art methods in the applications of blockchain in genomics. In this article, we systematically look at the existing work both commercial and academic, and discuss the major opportunities and challenges. Our study is driven by five research questions that we aim to answer in our review. We also present our projections of future research directions which we hope the researchers interested in the area can benefit from.},

abstract = {Light clients have been widely used in blockchain systems to support lightweight nodes by synchronizing and verifying block headers only. However, there are two major limitations with the current light client design. First, with the ever increasing blockchain size, the cost for light clients to process and store all the block headers would soon become prohibitively high. Second, only simple queries can be supported by light clients due to the limited functionality of block headers. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose DCert, a novel decentralized certification framework, to enable superlight clients with constant storage and state validation costs. The main idea is to leverage a trusted enclave (e.g., Intel SGX) to recursively certify the entire history of the blockchain. With DCert, the blockchain integrity can be easily validated by superlight clients with a secure certificate. Furthermore, to support rich verifiable queries on light clients, DCert can be extended to certify authenticated indexes for different types of queries on an as-needed basis. While DCert is compatible with existing blockchain systems, its security is guaranteed by the trusted enclave. Our benchmark-based empirical study shows that DCert incurs a small certification overhead, yet it is capable of supporting efficient verifiable queries with a constant storage size of 2.97 KB and a constant bootstrapping time of 0.14 ms.},

The number and variety of IoT devices are sharply increasing, and as they do, they generate significant data sources. Deep learning (DL) algorithms are increasingly integrated into IoT applications to learn and infer patterns and make intelligent decisions. However, current IoT paradigms rely on centralized storage and computing to operate the DL algorithms. This key central component can potentially cause issues in scalability, security threats, and privacy breaches. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a new paradigm for DL algorithms to preserve data privacy. Although FL helps reduce privacy leakage by avoiding transferring client data, it still has many challenges related to models’ vulnerabilities and attacks. With the emergence of blockchain and smart contracts, the utilization of these technologies has the potential to safeguard FL across IoT ecosystems. This study aims to review blockchain-based FL methods for securing IoT systems holistically. It presents the current state of research in blockchain, how it can be applied to FL approaches, current IoT security issues, and responses to outline the need to use emerging approaches toward the security and privacy of IoT ecosystems. It also focuses on IoT data analytics from a security perspective and the open research questions. It also provides a thorough literature review of blockchain-based FL approaches for IoT applications. Finally, the challenges and risks associated with integrating blockchain and FL in IoT are discussed to be considered in future works.},

Collecting or sharing healthcare data and sensitive information especially during Covid-19 pandemic has motivated organizations and enterprises to leverage the upsides coming from cloud-based applications. However, the privacy of electronic data in such applications remains a significant challenge for cloud vendors to adapt their solutions with existing privacy legislation standards such as general data protection regulation (GDPR). This paper, first, proposes a formal model and verification for data usage requests of providers in a cloud composite service using a model checking tool. A cloud pharmacy scenario is presented to illustrate the connectivity of providers in the composite service and the stream of their requests for both collection and movement of patient data. A set of verification is, then, undertaken over the pharmacy service in accordance with three significant GDPR obligations, namely user consent, data access and data transfer. Following that, the paper designs and implements a cloud container virtualization based on the verified formal model realising GDPR requirements. The container makes use of some enforcement smart contracts to only proceed the providers’ requests, which are compliant with GDPR. Finally, several experiments are provided to investigate the performance of our approach in terms of time, memory and cost.},

Blockchain-based systems have several architectural components and variants, which architects can leverage to build secure software systems. However, there is a lack of studies to assist architects in making architecture design and configuration decisions for blockchain-based systems. This knowledge gap may increase the chance of making unsuitable design decisions and producing configurations prone to potential security risks. To address this limitation, we report our comprehensive systematic literature review to derive a taxonomy of commonly used architecture design decisions in blockchain-based systems. We map each of these decisions to potential security attacks and their posed threats. MITRE’s attack tactic categories and Microsoft STRIDE threat modeling are used to systematically classify threats and their associated attacks to identify potential attacks and threats in blockchain-based systems. Our mapping approach aims to guide architects to make justifiable design decisions that will result in more secure implementations.},

abstract = {AI applications find widespread use in a variety of domains. For further acceptance, mostly when multiple agents interact with the system, we must aim to preserve the privacy of participants information in such applications. Towards this, the Yao’s Millionaires’ problem (YMP), i.e., to determine the richer among two millionaires’ privately, finds relevance. This work presents a novel, practical, and verifiable solution to YMP, namely, Secure Comparison Protocol (SCP). We show that SCP achieves this comparison in a constant number of rounds, without using encryption and not requiring the participants’ continuous involvement. SCP uses semi-trusted third parties - which we refer to as privacy accountants - for the comparison, who do not learn any information about the values. That is, the probability of information leak is negligible in the problem size. In SCP, we also leverage the Ethereum network for pseudo-anonymous communication, unlike computationally expensive secure channels such as Tor. We present a Secure Truthful cOmbinatorial aUction Protocol (STOUP) for single-minded bidders to demonstrate SCP’s significance. We show that STOUP, unlike previous works, preserves the privacies relevant to an auction even from the auctioneer. We demonstrate the practicality of STOUP through simulations.},

abstract = {Healthcare has undergone a rapid shift from traditional to smart health care system in recent times. The new paradigm takes a patient-centered approach and offers a variety of benefits to patients. Rapid technological developments have allowed for such a quick shift. The Internet of medical things (IoMT) is a key component of the development of smart health care systems. The current pandemic situation has demonstrated that IoMT systems can provide a quick patient diagnosis by continually monitoring their health and perhaps saving lives in the event of an emergency. But most IoMT devices were not built with security in mind, making them vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Furthermore, many gadgets such as smart sensors, wearable devices, handheld devices, and a variety of other heterogeneous devices being connected in a network for the smooth running of communication in healthcare make this system more vulnerable to security and privacy attacks. Security of IoMT devices and data is of paramount importance and critical to protecting the lives of patients. This survey attempts to explore applications of various recent technologies, particularly blockchain, PUFs, and AI/ML, in terms of security, privacy, protection, integrity, and authentication in IoMT ecosystem. In addition, insights into the benefits and limitations of existing security and privacy solutions have been provided.},

abstract = {Lately, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), i.e., uniquely discernible assets on a blockchain, have skyrocketed in popularity by addressing a broad audience. However, the typical NFT auctioning procedures are conducted in various, ad hoc ways, while mostly ignoring the context that the blockchain provides, i.e., new possibilities, but at the same time new challenges in auction design. One of the main targets of this work is to shed light on the vastly unexplored design space of NFT Auction Mechanisms, especially in those characteristics that fundamentally differ from traditional and more contemporaneous forms of auctions. We focus on the case that bidders have a valuation for the auctioned NFT, i.e., what we term the single-item NFT auction case. In this setting, we formally define an NFT Auction Mechanism, give the properties that we would ideally like a perfect mechanism to satisfy (broadly known as incentive compatibility and collusion resistance) and prove that it is impossible to have such a perfect mechanism. Even though we cannot have an all-powerful protocol like that, we move on to consider relaxed notions of those properties that we may desire the protocol to satisfy, as a trade-off between implementability and economic guarantees. Specifically, we define the notion of an equilibrium-truthful auction, where neither the seller nor the bidders can improve their utility by acting non-truthfully, so long as the counter-party acts truthfully. We also define asymptotically second-price auctions, in which the seller does not lose asymptotically any revenue in comparison to the theoretically-optimal (static) second-price sealed-bid auction, in the case that the bidders' valuations are drawn independently from some distribution. We showcase why these two are very desirable properties for an auction mechanism to enjoy, and construct the first known NFT Auction Mechanism which provably possesses such formal guarantees.},

abstract = {DNS has often been criticized for inherent design flaws, which make the system vulnerable to attack. Further, domain names are not fully controlled by users, meaning that they can easily be taken down by authorities and registrars. Due to this, there have been efforts to build a decentralized name service that gives greater control to domain owners. The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a major example. Yet, no existing work has systematically studied this emerging system, particularly regarding security and misbehavior. To address this gap, we present the first large-scale measurement study of ENS. Our findings suggest that ENS has shown growth during its four years' evolution. We identify several security issues, including traditional name system problems, as well as new issues introduced by the unique properties of ENS. We find that attackers are abusing the system with thousands of squatting ENS names, a number of scam blockchain addresses and indexing of malicious websites. We further develop a new record persistence attack, to find that 22,716 .eth names (3.7% of all names) are vulnerable to name hijacking. Our exploration suggests that our community should invest more effort into the detection and mitigation of issues in decentralized name services.},

However, those protocols are not fault-tolerant, in the sense that if any party deviates, no asset transfer can happen. In this paper, we propose two alternative protocols for structuring composable and robust cross-chain swaps. Participants can propose multiple swaps simultaneously and then complete a subset of those swaps according to their needs. Their needs are expressed as predicates which capture acceptable payoff of each participant. Our proposed protocols are thus more expressive due to the introduction of predicates. The proposed protocols are fault-tolerant since, even if some participants deviate, those predicates can still be satisfied, and conforming parties can complete an acceptable set of swaps.},

So therefore it is crucial to have a complete secure system architecture, where various security features aid the digitized platform. In this paper, a banking management system architecture is proposed where the system is devised with the interaction of three modern technologies: Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, and Hyperledger. All these three technologies are working together as one part of a multi-layer security and management system, as well as, it improves the security of the bank. In order to analyze the implementation of these systems, each of the architectures is defined separately with comparison-based evaluation to derive the fact how these technologies within our system architecture works efficiently.},

Blockchain has decentralized mechanisms with persistency and auditability and runs as an immutable distributed ledger, where transactions are jointly performed through cryptocurrency-based consensus algorithms by worldwide distributed nodes. There have been many survey papers reviewing the blockchain technologies from different perspectives, e.g., digital currencies, consensus algorithms, and smart contracts. However, none of them have focused on the blockchain data management systems. To fill in this gap, we have conducted a comprehensive survey on the data management systems, based on three typical types of blockchain, i.e., standard blockchain, hybrid blockchain, and DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)-based blockchain. We categorize their data management mechanisms into three layers: blockchain architecture, blockchain data structure, and blockchain storage engine, where block architecture indicates how to record transactions on a distributed ledger, blockchain data structure refers to the internal structure of each block, and blockchain storage engine specifies the storage form of data on the blockchain system. For each layer, the works advancing the state-of-the-art are discussed together with technical challenges. Furthermore, we lay out several possible future research directions for the blockchain data management systems.},

abstract = {Hyperledger Fabric has become one of the most widely used consortium blockchain frameworks with the ability to execute custom smart contracts. Performance modeling and network evaluation are necessary for performance estimation and optimization of the Fabric blockchain platform. The compatibility and effectiveness of existing performance modeling methods must be improved. For this reason, we proposed a compatible performance modeling method using queuing theory for Fabric considering the limited transaction pool. Taking the 2.0 version of Fabric as a case, we have established the model for the transaction process in the Fabric network. By analyzing the two-dimensional continuous-time Markov process of this model, we solved the system stationary equation and obtained the analytical expressions of performance indicators such as the system throughput, the system steady-state queue length, and the system’s average response time. We collected the required parameter values through the official test suite. An extensive analysis and simulation was performed to verify the accuracy and the effectiveness of the model and formula. We believe that this method can be extended to a wide range of scenarios in other blockchain systems.},

abstract = {We present FairTraDEX, a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol based on frequent batch auctions (FBAs), which provides formal game-theoretic guarantees against extractable value. FBAs, when run by a trusted third-party, ensure that the unique game-theoretic optimal strategy for all players is to trade at the true market-implied price of the underlying token swap, excluding explicit, pre-determined fees. FairTraDEX replicates the key features of an FBA that provide these game-theoretic guarantees using a combination of set-membership in zero-knowledge protocols and an escrow-enforced commit-reveal mechanism. We extend the results of FBAs to handle monopolistic and/or malicious liquidity providers. We provide real-world examples that demonstrate that the costs of executing orders in existing academic and industry-standard protocols become prohibitive as order size increases due to basic value extraction techniques, popularized as maximal extractable value. We further demonstrate that FairTraDEX protects against these execution costs, guaranteeing a fixed fee model independent of order size, the first guarantee of it's kind for a DEX protocol. We also provide detailed Solidity and pseudo-code implementations of FairTraDEX, making FairTraDEX a novel and practical contribution.},

abstract = {The rapid evolution of technology has massively changed and shaped audit work culture. At the same time, the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak significantly changed audit and control activities, encouraging auditors to audit clients remotely and forcing auditors to adopt advanced digital technology, especially blockchain-based technology. Blockchain is one decentralized, transparent, and immutable technology that plays an essential role and has an aggressive impact in the audit field. The implementation and adoption of cognitive technologies such as blockchain in the remote audit process allow auditors to access various client data and information in real-time, ensure audit data integrity, review and process data documentation quickly, obtaining data directly without third parties that make it easier for auditors to obtain audit evidence instantly and accurately in detecting any anomalies. This research aims to identify and navigate how blockchain assists auditors in performing remote audits, ensuring data integrity, detecting fraudulent financial reporting, elaborating on factors that influence the auditor's success in using blockchain, and identifying challenges auditors face during blockchain utilization in their remote audits. This research used a descriptive qualitative approach by obtaining primary data from profound interview results with several auditors experienced in using blockchain. We also used secondary data from journals, papers, articles, books, and relevant websites. The research findings showed that blockchain's unique characteristics greatly assist auditors in conducting remote audits, ensuring audit data integrity, and detecting fraudulent financial reporting in various ways. Furthermore, various factors influence blockchain utilization, such as human resources aspects, the effectiveness of the IT control environment, and the CPA size firm. Lastly, auditors should face several challenges in the present and future.},

abstract = {As smart contracts gain adoption in financial transactions, it becomes increasingly important to ensure that they are free of bugs and security vulnerabilities. Of particular relevance in this context are arithmetic overflow bugs, as integers are often used to represent financial assets like account balances. Motivated by this observation, this paper presents SolType, a refinement type system for Solidity that can be used to prevent arithmetic over- and under-flows in smart contracts. SolType allows developers to add refinement type annotations and uses them to prove that arithmetic operations do not lead to over- and under-flows. SolType incorporates a rich vocabulary of refinement terms that allow expressing relationships between integer values and aggregate properties of complex data structures. Furthermore, our implementation, called Solid, incorporates a type inference engine and can automatically infer useful type annotations, including non-trivial contract invariants. To evaluate the usefulness of our type system, we use Solid to prove arithmetic safety of a total of 120 smart contracts. When used in its fully automated mode (i.e., using Solid's type inference capabilities), Solid is able to eliminate 86.3% of redundant runtime checks used to guard against overflows. We also compare Solid against a state-of-the-art arithmetic safety verifier called VeriSmart and show that Solid has a significantly lower false positive rate, while being significantly faster in terms of verification time.},

Blockchain-based architectures have repeatedly been suggested for this purpose since they can provide transparency and can likely be accepted by a broad group of stakeholders. Yet, there are significant scalability and privacy issues of a blockchain-based approach for storing and processing fine-grained production and consumption data.

abstract = {Zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic protocol that allows one party to prove the correctness of a statement to another party without revealing any information beyond the correctness of the statement itself. It guarantees computation integrity and confidentiality, and is therefore increasingly adopted in industry for a variety of privacy-preserving applications, such as verifiable outsource computing and digital currency. A significant obstacle in using ZKP for online applications is the performance overhead of its proof generation. We develop GZKP, a GPU accelerated zero-knowledge proof system that supports different levels of security requirements and brings significant speedup toward making ZKP truly usable. For polynomial computation over a large finite field, GZKP promotes a cache-friendly memory access pattern while eliminating the costly external shuffle in existing solutions. For multi-scalar multiplication, GZKP adopts a new parallelization strategy, which aggressively combines integer elliptic curve point operations and exploits fine-grained task parallelism with load balancing for sparse integer distribution. GZKP outperforms the state-of-the-art ZKP systems by an order of magnitude, achieving up to 48.1\texttimes{} and 17.6\texttimes{} speedup with standard cryptographic benchmarks and a real-world application workload, respectively.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of smart industry, the data acquisition ability of edge devices in the perception layer of smart factory is gradually improved. The security of Industrial Internet of Things has increasingly become a common focus. Aiming at the data security problem in the security of industrial Internet of things, combined with the current situation of industrial Internet of things equipment, this paper proposed an anonymous storage and verification model of industrial production status which is based on blockchain. The purpose of this paper is to ensure the storage security and efficient use of industrial production data. We improve the existing Industrial Internet of Things architecture and add blockchain to participate in smart factory privacy protection and data automation processing. On this basis, anonymous storage and verification algorithm for production status, DCB (Double Color Ball) algorithm, is designed. Finally, the simulation industry platform is built, and the architecture is realized by taking the simulation industry platform as an example. The proposed structure can verify data anonymously on the premise of ensuring data security through theoretical analysis and experiment. Besides, the IIoT system still maintains a low overhead.},

abstract = {Recent initiatives related to the Metaverse focus on better visualisation, like augmented or virtual reality, but also persistent digital objects. To guarantee real ownership of these digital objects, open systems based on public blockchains and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are emerging together with a nascent decentralized and open creator economy. To manage this emerging economy in a more organised way, and fight the so common NFT plagiarism, we propose CopyrightLY, a decentralized application for authorship and copyright management. It provides means to claim content authorship, including supporting evidence. Content and metadata are stored in decentralized storage and registered on the blockchain. A token is used to curate these claims, and potential complaints, by staking it on them. Staking is incentivized by the fact that the token is minted using a bonding curve. The tokenomics include the resolution of complaints and enabling the monetization of curated claims. Monetization is achieved through licensing NFTs with metadata enhanced by semantic technologies. Semantic data makes explicit the reuse conditions transferred with the token while keeping the connection to the underlying copyright claims to improve the trustability of the NFTs. Moreover, the semantic metadata is flexible enough to enable licensing not just in the real world. Licenses can refer to reuses in specific locations in a metaverse, thus facilitating the emergence of creative economies in them.},

abstract = {The rise of Ethereum has lead to a flourishing decentralized marketplace that has, unfortunately, fallen victim to frontrunning and Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) activities, where savvy participants game transaction orderings within a block for profit. One popular solution to address such behavior is Flashbots, a private pool with infrastructure and design goals aimed at eliminating the negative externalities associated with MEV. While Flashbots has established laudable goals to address MEV behavior, no evidence has been provided to show that these goals are achieved in practice.In this paper, we measure the popularity of Flashbots and evaluate if it is meeting its chartered goals. We find that (1) Flashbots miners account for over 99.9% of the hashing power in the Ethereum network, (2) powerful miners are making more than 2X what they were making prior to using Flashbots, while non-miners' slice of the pie has shrunk commensurately, (3) mining is just as centralized as it was prior to Flashbots with more than 90% of Flashbots blocks coming from just two miners, and (4) while more than 80% of MEV extraction in Ethereum is happening through Flashbots, 13.2% is coming from other private pools.},

abstract = {With the recent proliferation of blockchains, identifying security risks to them has become an important issue. Among the various types of cyberattacks against blockchains, the blockchain poisoning attack involves the storing of malicious data in the blockchain to compromise it. One scenario is an attack that distributes forgeries of digital content traded and managed using Non-Fungible Token (NFT) on the blockchain. Currently, concomitant with the growing interest in NFT-based content trading, blockchain poisoning attacks on NFT trading and their effects have also increased. In this study, we examined the issues that may lead to attacks in the process from generation to distribution of digital content using NFT from the viewpoint of flexibility and interoperability of the content. Consequently, we discovered that there are two types of attack risks in NFT trading using malicious content: fake attacks and reuse attacks. As a countermeasure against these attacks, we propose a method for verifying the authenticity of the content itself using a decentralized scheme. The proposed method ensures the confidentiality of contents by using deep learning as an irreversible transformation operation in the distributed scheme and for privacy protection.},

abstract = {Employee data can be used to facilitate work, but their misusage may pose risks for individuals. Inverse transparency therefore aims to track all usages of personal data, allowing individuals to monitor them to ensure accountability for potential misusage. This necessitates a trusted log to establish an agreed-upon and non-repudiable timeline of events. The unique properties of blockchain facilitate this by providing immutability and availability. For power asymmetric environments such as the workplace, permissionless blockchain is especially beneficial as no trusted third party is required. Yet, two issues remain: (1) In a decentralized environment, no arbiter can facilitate and attest to data exchanges. Simple peer-to-peer sharing of data, conversely, lacks the required non-repudiation. (2) With data governed by privacy legislation such as the GDPR, the core advantage of immutability becomes a liability. After a rightful request, an individual’s personal data need to be rectified or deleted, which is impossible in an immutable blockchain. To solve these issues, we present Kovacs, a decentralized data exchange and usage logging system for inverse transparency built on blockchain. Its new-usage protocol ensures non-repudiation, and therefore accountability, for inverse transparency. Its one-time pseudonym generation algorithm guarantees unlinkability and enables proof of ownership, which allows data subjects to exercise their legal rights regarding their personal data. With our implementation, we show the viability of our solution. The decentralized communication impacts performance and scalability, but exchange duration and storage size are still reasonable. More importantly, the provided information security meets high requirements. We conclude that Kovacs realizes decentralized inverse transparency through secure and GDPR-compliant use of permissionless blockchain.},

Some large files and a lot of redundant data are not suitable for direct link. We propose an on-chain and off-chain collaborative storage model. We use consortium chains in conjunction with IPFS (Interplanetary File System). The proposed framework can meet the needs of all parties to share data in the case of distrust.

Local economics relies on trust and reputation through repeated interactions within a community of participants that know each other, which has not previously been leveraged for the design of crypto-tokens. In this paper, we formulate the design of new local crypto-tokens as a research problem: we present concrete application examples, we identify double-spending detection as a weaker and sufficient alternative to double-spending prevention in local applications, and we formulate desired properties of new local crypto-tokens designs. Based on our analysis, we envision local crypto-tokens to complement existing blockchain projects by facilitating intra-community economics at much lower latency and costs, while evolutions of current blockchain projects will provide global inter-community exchanges of high-value transactions.},

When determinism is not met it can lead to serious implications in the blockchain network while compromising the software development, release, and patching processes. In the industrial context, it is widespread to adopt general-purpose languages, such as Go, for developing blockchain solutions. However, it is not surprising that non-deterministic behaviors may arise, being these programming languages not originally designed for blockchain purposes. In this paper, we present an experience report on ensuring determinism in blockchain software with GoLiSA, a static analyzer based on abstract interpretation for Go applications, in an industrial context. In particular, we ran GoLiSA on Commercio.network, a blockchain-based solution for exchanging electronic documents in a legally binding way. Thanks to GoLiSA, non-trivial bugs got detected and the analysis performed made it possible to identify the critical points where to apply the fixes.},

Scalability is one of the main problems that limit its usage. This paper introduces a full sharding protocol, Geochain, for permissioned blockchains. We first clarify the limitations of state-of-the-art sharding protocols. Then, we propose a locality-based sharding protocol that achieves high scalability. We optimize inter-shard performance by clustering participants using their geographical properties, locality. In addition, the locality is also employed to decide the transaction placement which results in a low ratio of cross-shard transactions for applications, such as everyday banking, retail payments, and electric vehicle charging. We also propose a client-driven efficient mechanism to handle cross-shard transactions and present an analysis. This enables clients to manage their assets across different shards directly. A prototype is implemented on top of Hyperledger Fabric v2.3 and evaluated on Amazon EC2. The experiments show that our protocol doubles the peak throughput, even with a high ratio of cross-shard transactions, while minimizing the transaction latency.},

Transactions are grouped in blocks, and every execution of the block must yield the same deterministic outcome. Block-STM further enforces that the outcome is consistent with executing transactions according to a preset order, leveraging this order to dynamically detect dependencies and avoid conflicts during speculative transaction execution. At the core of Block-STM is a novel, low-overhead collaborative scheduler of execution and validation tasks.Block-STM is implemented on the main branch of the Diem Blockchain code-base and runs in production at Aptos. Our evaluation demonstrates that Block-STM is adaptive to workloads with different conflict rates and utilizes the inherent parallelism therein. Block-STM achieves up to 110k tps in the Diem benchmarks and up to 170k tps in the Aptos Benchmarks, which is a 20x and 17x improvement over the sequential baseline with 32 threads, respectively.

A PSS is a business model in which products and services are tightly connected. One of the main advantages of such a PSS is that it optimizes product use, with a positive environmental impact. Associating the LCMS with a blockchain-based protocol makes it possible to avoid centralization. Semi-formal UML models of such a LCMS, as well as the informal properties it must comply with, were defined in order to explore its design space and evaluate the outcomes of specific design choices. However, the security of the LCMS implementation must be guaranteed, including protocols and architecture. For that purpose, these models and properties were later improved to be formally verifiable, which ensures the security of their implementation at the expense of added complexity. The verification was carried out using two available software tools: VerifPal for the protocol model, and AnimUML (developed by one of the authors) for the architecture model. This makes the procedure accessible for non-specialists in formal verification. Finally, our feedback on the whole process as well as on VerifPal is also provided.},

abstract = {The technological advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) is a well-known phenomenon that mainly affects industrial sectors but also consumers in everyday life. The use of Consumer IoT, i.e. CIoT, devices is increasing, and they are paving the way for a Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication that could highly enrich consumer services. In this paper we position ourselves in the narrowing gap between the world of CIoT and the world of money, and we explore the emerging interaction between the payment needs of a M2M Economy and the "new ways of payment". Indeed, the advent of Distributed Ledger Technology and cryptocurrencies has introduced a tech-oriented dynamism in the monetary and financial sphere. Accordingly, central banks all over the world have started investigations into digital fiat money, i.e., "retail" Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Against this backdrop, we analyze the integration of retail CBDC models into M2M and CIoT dynamics, while heeding regulation-by-design and compliance-by/through-design methodologies, and we propose a preliminary model of integration between a two-tier retail CBDC architecture and CIoT.},

A blockchain-based cable supply chain traceability system is designed using blockchain technology to integrate, share and supervise cable supply chain data. This system includes five functional modules: user management, data upload, two-way traceability, data sharing, and complaint handling. According to the characteristics of the cable traceability cycle, the storage module adopts a combination of blockchain, Inter-planetary File System (IPFS) and MySQL to meet different business needs. The experimental results show that the system basically meets the performance requirements and has good practicability.},

abstract = {Edge computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) are inextricably linked, and much work has been devoted to strengthening their symbiotic relationship, providing better coverage and quality of service. These solutions are typically vertically tailored, provider-specific and bound to work within one administrative domain, as they presume direct deployment and ownership of the resources controlled in a centralised fashion. This model has effectively created a myriad of physically interconnected elements, logically broken down into separate domain-specific islands, each possibly applying different security/privacy policies, device and process control mechanisms, service access and provisioning schemes etc. To address this data and service balkanization phenomena, complex and time-consuming interactions between multiple providers are required to set up and operate federation of resources across domains and/or providers. Without loss of generality, we envision a scenario where stakeholders in a Smart Tourism ecosystem participate in resource federations to enrich their services and exploit complementarities. In this context, we present a decentralized architecture, relying on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), providing a flexible and effective federated access control mechanism to data and services.},

abstract = {Blockchain is a decentralized technology proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, without relying on trust, irrevocable and modified, based on a consensus mechanism. Blockchain technology was not created out of thin air, but was born as the underlying technology of bitcoin, a digital currency. Now it has received widespread attention for its implementation in distributed ledger. However, in the current era, the application of blockchain technology in actual scenarios has not yet matured, mainly due to some characteristics of blockchain technology itself. After weighing its advantages and disadvantages, it is increasingly becoming its limitation. One of the main aspects is the poor scalability of the blockchain, which not only limits the functional expansion of the blockchain and makes it impossible to apply the blockchain technology to a wider range of scenarios, but also limits the throughput of the blockchain system to a certain extent Promotion. Taking into account the characteristics and bottlenecks of the above-mentioned blockchain technology, different from previous studies, this article from the perspective of blockchain expansion, introduces some existing expansion technologies in solving the transaction rate of the blockchain, and analyzes its principles and feasibility. Through the classification and comparison of different expansion technologies, the advantages and possible disadvantages of various expansion technologies are described. Finally, on the basis of fully understanding the existing blockchain expansion technology, the outlook for the future development of blockchain expansion technology is proposed, with a view to providing some suggestions for the development of the blockchain expansion technology.},

abstract = {Social networks have become an inseparable part of human activities. Most existing social networks follow a centralized system model, which despite storing valuable information of users, arise many critical concerns such as content ownership and over-commercialization. Recently, decentralized social networks, built primarily on blockchain technology, have been proposed as a substitution to eliminate these concerns. Since decentralized architectures are mature enough to be on par with the centralized ones, decentralized social networks are becoming more and more popular. Decentralized social networks can offer both common options like writing posts and comments and more advanced options such as reward systems and voting mechanisms. They provide rich eco-systems for the influencers to interact with their followers and other users via staking systems based on cryptocurrency tokens. The vast and valuable data of the decentralized social networks open several new directions for the research community to extend human behavior knowledge. However, accessing and collecting data from these social networks is not easy because it requires strong blockchain knowledge, which is not the main focus of computer science and social science researchers. Hence, our work proposes the SoChainDB framework that facilitates obtaining data from these new social networks. To show the capacity and strength of SoChainDB, we crawl and publish Hive data - one of the largest blockchain-based social networks. We conduct extensive analyses to understand the insight of Hive data and discuss some interesting applications, e.g., game, non-fungible tokens market built upon Hive. It is worth mentioning that our framework is well-adaptable to other blockchain social networks with minimal modification. SoChainDB is publicly accessible at http://sochaindb.com and the dataset is available under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license.},

abstract = {Modern computer systems tend to rely on large trusted computing bases (TCBs) for operations. To address the TCB bloating problem, hardware vendors have developed mechanisms to enable or facilitate the creation of a trusted execution environment (TEE) in which critical software applications can execute securely in an isolated environment. Even under the circumstance that a host OS is compromised by an adversary, key security properties such as confidentiality and integrity of the software inside the TEEs can be guaranteed. The promise of integrity and security has driven developers to adopt it for use cases involving access control, PKS, IoT among other things. Among these applications include blockchain-related use cases. The usage of the TEEs doesn’t come without its own implementation challenges and potential pitfalls. In this paper, we examine the assumptions, security models, and operational environments of the proposed TEE use cases of blockchain-based applications. The exercise and analysis help the hardware TEE research community to identify some open challenges and opportunities for research and rethink the design of hardware TEEs in general.},

Where some degree of consensus has arisen is that the increasing complexity of the contemporary era is driving interdisciplinarity and addressing complexity demands an epistemological shift from a reductionist examination of isolated parts to the systemic examination of the integrated whole. Such a shift compels an approach to knowledge that is one of engagement thus requiring a cognitive toolkit that includes such things as empathy, open-mindedness, tolerance of ambiguity, and intellectual courage. Acquiring such skills typically requires human interaction, and the inadequacy of current educational tools has become very apparent in the amplified online environment prompted by the global pandemic. This paper outlines the epistemological demands of Interdisciplinary Studies and the challenges of current technology. It then proposes the application of the emerging digital technologies to address these challenges.},

abstract = {Limitations on high latency and low scalability of classical blockchain systems retard their adoptions and applications. Reconstructed blockchain systems have been proposed to avoid the consumption of competitive transactions caused by linear sequenced blocks. These systems, instead, structure transactions/blocks in the form of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and consequently rebuild upper layer components. The promise of DAG-based blockchain systems is to enable fast confirmation (complete transactions within million seconds) and high scalability (attach transactions in parallel) without significantly compromising security. However, this field still lacks systematic work that summarises DAG techniques. To bridge the gap, this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) provides a comprehensive analysis of ever-existing and ongoing DAG-based blockchain systems. We abstract a general model to capture the main features and identify six types of design patterns. Then, we evaluate these systems from the perspectives of structure, consensus, property, security, and performance. We further discuss the trade-off between different factors, open challenges, and the potentiality of DAG-based solutions, indicating their promising directions for future research.},

Blockchain technology has the characteristics of transparency and credibility, tamper-proof traceability, privacy security and high reliability of the system, and it is of great significance to study how to apply blockchain technology to improve the logistics and supply chain information system of pandemic prevention materials, so as to better cope with the current and possible future pandemic. To this end, this paper uses the literature analysis method and knowledge map method to reveal the research status, hot spots and evolution context of blockchain technology application in the logistics and supply chain information system under pandemic-hit. The research results show that there is a significant correlation between the number and theme changes of relevant literature and the progress of pandemic prevention and control. There have been a number of research hotspots, but they are still relatively scattered. There are few studies on the organic combination of blockchain technology application, pandemic prevention and control, the logistics and supply chain information system.

abstract = {Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are unique digital identifiers used to represent ownership of various cryptoassets such as music, artwork, collectibles, game assets and allow for an unalterable and provable chain of creation and ownership. The market for NFTs exploded in 2021, and much of the public is being exposed to this new digital ownership medium for the first time. While uptake of this new medium is relatively slow, we feel the prospects of blockchain technology are up-and-coming. NFTs are still largely misunderstood by the wider community, and as such, this provides a fascinating opportunity to explore the NFT marketplace in greater depth. We analyzed sales data from OpenSea - the NFT marketplace with the most extensive user base and sales volume. Our study considered 5.25 million sales that occurred between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2021. We first lead by presenting an overview of our data collection process and summarizing key statistics of the data set. We examine user behaviour in the market to show that a small subset of heavy-hitters is driving massive growth. Secondly, we review the economic activity within the network to show how these power users drive extreme price volatility within the Art and Collectible categories. Lastly, we review the network of buyers and sellers to show that despite the sparsity that exists in the network, communities of users are forming, and most power users tend to congregate in these structures. These findings shed light on areas of the NFT marketplace that have been relatively unexamined and provide a multi-level analysis of a multi-billion dollar market.},

abstract = {The spread of deceptive or misleading information, commonly referred to as misinformation, poses a social, economic, and political threat. Such deceptive information spreads quickly and inexpensively. For example, with the hype around blockchain technologies, misinformation on “get rich quick” scams on the Web is rampant, as evidenced by sophisticated Twitter hacks of celebrities and many social media posts that bait unsuspecting users to visit phishing websites. Unfortunately, AI technologies have contributed to the growing pains of misinformation on the Web, with the advances in technologies such as generative adversarial deep learning techniques that can generate “deep fakes” for nefarious purposes. At the same time, researchers are working on a different set of AI technologies to combat misinformation, akin to “fighting fire with fire.” As there is no clear way to win the online “cat-and-mouse” game against fake news generators and spreaders of misinformation, we believe social media platforms could be fortified with blockchain and AI technologies to mitigate the extent of misinformation propagation in various communities worldwide. Tamper-proof blockchain techniques can provide irrefutable evidence of what content is authentic, guaranteeing how the information has evolved with provenance trails. Various AI models that could be used for detecting fake news can be served on a blockchain for the effective and transparent utility of the model. Such a synergistic combination of AI and blockchain is a burgeoning area of research. This paper outlines a proposal for combining blockchain and AI techniques for handling misinformation on the Web and highlights some of the early ongoing work in this space.},

abstract = {Industrial processes rely on sensory data for decision-making processes, risk assessment, and performance evaluation. Extracting actionable insights from the collected data calls for an infrastructure that can ensure the dissemination of trustworthy data. For the physical data to be trustworthy, it needs to be cross validated through multiple sensor sources with overlapping fields of view. Cross-validated data can then be stored on the blockchain, to maintain its integrity and trustworthiness. Once trustworthy data is recorded on the blockchain, product lifecycle events can be fed into data-driven systems for process monitoring, diagnostics, and optimized control. In this regard, digital twins (DTs) can be leveraged to draw intelligent conclusions from data by identifying the faults and recommending precautionary measures ahead of critical events. Empowering DTs with blockchain in industrial use cases targets key challenges of disparate data repositories, untrustworthy data dissemination, and the need for predictive maintenance. In this survey, while highlighting the key benefits of using blockchain-based DTs, we present a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art research results for blockchain-based DTs. Based on the current research trends, we discuss a trustworthy blockchain-based DTs framework. We also highlight the role of artificial intelligence in blockchain-based DTs. Furthermore, we discuss the current and future research and deployment challenges of blockchain-supported DTs that require further investigation.},

abstract = {The paper discusses the influence exerted by financial systems on the change of the financial sector and its further development. The study is relevant since there is need for building up more trust in blockchain. In the course of the research, the main trends of decentralized financial systems were identified and presented, including the problems related to decentralized financial systems and options for resolving them. The study is aimed at defining the problems and searching for ways to tackle them when regulating decentralized finances (DeFi) in order to ensure effective regulation on the part of the Central Bank and control risks. Rather than eliminating the need for regulation, DeFi, in fact, has to be regulated so as to achieve its main decentralization goal. In addition, DeFi presents a potential possibility for developing a fairly new regulation method: the idea of “integrated regulation”. The paper considers various approaches to regulation, which can be integrated in the DeFi design. It can potentially lead to the decentralization of both finance and its regulation, which eventually expresses RegTech (Regulatory Technology), which is used by financial organizations for being able to meet the requirements of the regulator more easily. The study defines the problems that are encountered in the course of using DeFi and points out the possible ways for dealing with them, including a way for switching to blockchain independently so that the transaction is not charged in ETH for calculation on blockchain; reducing the complexity and costs of use and understanding of DeFi software by most users. A whole lot of risks that decentralized financial protocols are susceptible to is analyzed: vulnerabilities in the code security of smart contracts, their stacking and layout; oracle risk, which is subject to manipulation in the process of data transfer; the financial risk of high volatility, regulatory risk and crisis of the global economy due to the inability to predict in which way the Covid-19 pandemic is going to be resolved.},

abstract = {Developing a bug-free compiler is difficult; modern optimizing compilers are among the most complex software systems humans build. Fuzzing is one way to identify subtle compiler bugs that are hard to find with human-constructed tests. Grammar-based fuzzing, however, requires a grammar for a compiler’s input language, and can miss bugs induced by code that does not actually satisfy the grammar the compiler should accept. Grammar-based fuzzing also seldom uses advanced modern fuzzing techniques based on coverage feedback. However, modern mutation-based fuzzers are often ineffective for testing compilers because most inputs they generate do not even come close to getting past the parsing stage of compilation. This paper introduces a technique for taking a modern mutation-based fuzzer (AFL in our case, but the method is general) and augmenting it with operators taken from mutation testing, and program splicing. We conduct a controlled study to show that our hybrid approaches significantly improve fuzzing effectiveness qualitatively (consistently finding unique bugs that baseline approaches do not) and quantitatively (typically finding more unique bugs in the same time span, despite fewer program executions). Our easy-to-apply approach has allowed us to report more than 100 confirmed and fixed bugs in production compilers, and found a bug in the Solidity compiler that earned a security bounty.},

This demo introduces PhishChain, a transparent and decentralized system for blacklisting phishing URLs. At present, public/private domain blacklists, such as PhishTank, CryptoScamDB, and APWG, are maintained by a centralized authority, but operate in a crowd sourcing fashion to create a manually verified blacklist periodically. In addition to being a single point of failure, the blacklisting process utilized by such systems is not transparent. We utilize the blockchain technology to support transparency and decentralization, where no single authority is controlling the blacklist and all operations are recorded in an immutable distributed ledger. Further, we design a page rank based truth discovery algorithm to assign a phishing score to each URL based on crowd sourced assessment of URLs. As an incentive for voluntary participation, we assign skill points to each user based on their participation in URL verification.},

While payment channels for script-empowered blockchains (such as Bitcoin and Ethereum) have been well studied, developing payment channels for scriptless blockchains (such as Monero) is considered challenging. In particular, nabling bidirectional payment on scriptless blockchains remains an open challenge.This work closes this gap by providing AuxChannel, the first bi-directional payment channel protocol for scriptless blockchains, meaning that building payment channels only requires the support of verifiably encrypted signature (aka adaptor signature) on the underlying blockchain. AuxChannel leverages verifiably encrypted signature to create a commitment for each off-chain payment and deploys a verifiable decentralised key escrow service to resolve dispute. To enable efficient construction of AuxChannel, we introduce a new cryptographic primitive, named Consecutive Verifiably Encrypted Signature (CVES), as a core building block and it can also be of independent interest for other applications. We provide and implement a provably secure instantiation on Schnorr-based CVES. We also provide a formal security analysis on the security of the AuxChannel.},

abstract = {Personal data is an attractive source of insights for a diverse field of research and business. While our data is highly valuable, it is often privacy-sensitive. Thus, regulations like the GDPR restrict what data can be legally published, and what a buyer may do with this sensitive data. While personal data must be protected, we can still sell some insights gathered from our data that do not hurt our privacy. A data marketplace is a platform that helps users to sell their data while assisting buyers in discovering relevant datasets. The major challenge such a marketplace faces is balancing between offering valuable insights into data while preserving privacy requirements. Private data marketplaces try to solve this challenge by offering privacy-preserving computations on personal data. Such computations allow for calculating statistics or training machine learning models on personal data without accessing the data in plain. However, the user selling the data cannot restrict who can buy or what type of computation the data is allowed. We close the latter gap by proposing a flexible access control architecture for private data marketplaces, which can be applied to existing data markets. Our architecture enables data sellers to define detailed policies restricting who can buy their data. Furthermore, a seller can control what computation a specific buyer can purchase on the data, and make constraints on its parameters to mitigate privacy breaches. The data market’s computation system then enforces the policies before initiating a computation. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we provide an implementation for the KRAKEN marketplace, a distributed data market using MPC. We show that our approach is practical since it introduces a negligible performance overhead and is secure against several adversaries.},

abstract = {Blockchain technology has gained increasing popularity among the business community due to its numerous advantages for business such as decentralization, immutability, and transparency. Specifically, with a reliable transaction system, blockchain technology has developed information sharing and supply chain management in the textile industry. Although there is a growing number of research publications in the field of blockchain technology applications, there is a lack of systematic knowledge of the current literature regarding how blockchain technology is effectively applied to the textile industry, increasing the possibility of getting irrelevant, biased, or unclear information. Thus, the purpose of this study is to analyze, identify, and classify the existing literature to provide a comprehensive overview of the state of the art on using blockchain technology in the main activities of textile industry enterprises such as production and marketing. The researchers looked for publications and expert opinions articulating different applications of blockchain technology in marketing and production activities of the textile industry based on the analysis of academic databases selected and stakeholder interviews. The results highlighted that the most common categories of using blockchain technology in the textile industry are information sharing and supply chain traceability to integrate with the production and marketing activities of textile companies. The scientific contributions of this systematic mapping study are expected to be the classified portfolio of key publications and content taxonomy that demonstrates the state of the art in the whole research field. Finally, we concluded the paper with practical and theoretical implications and developed a future research agenda on closing the potential gap between blockchain-enhanced production and marketing activities of textile companies.},

abstract = {Analyses that fulfill differential privacy provide plausible deniability to individuals while allowing analysts to extract insights from data. However, beyond an often acceptable accuracy tradeoff, these statistical disclosure techniques generally inhibit the verifiability of the provided information, as one cannot check the correctness of the participants’ truthful information, the differentially private mechanism, or the unbiased random number generation. While related work has already discussed this opportunity, an efficient implementation with a precise bound on errors and corresponding proofs of the differential privacy property is so far missing. In this paper, we follow an approach based on zero-knowledge proofs&nbsp;(ZKPs), in specific succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge, as a verifiable computation technique to prove the correctness of a differentially private query output. In particular, we ensure the guarantees of differential privacy hold despite the limitations of ZKPs that operate on finite fields and have limited branching capabilities. We demonstrate that our approach has practical performance and discuss how practitioners could employ our primitives to verifiably query individuals’ age from their digitally signed ID card in a differentially private manner.},

abstract = {Blockchain games introduce unique gameplay and incentive mechanisms by allowing players to be rewarded with in-game assets or tokens through financial activities. However, most blockchain games are not comparable to traditional games in terms of lifespan and player engagement. In this paper, we try to see the big picture in a small way to explore and determine the impact of gameplay and financial factors on player behavior in blockchain games. Taking Aavegotchi as an example, we collect one year of operation data to build player profiles. We perform an in-depth analysis of player behavior from the macroscopic data and apply an unsupervised clustering method to distinguish the attraction of the gameplay and incentives. Our results reveal that the whole game is held up by a small number of players with high-frequent interaction or vast amounts of funds invested. Financial incentives are indispensable for blockchain games for they provide attraction and optional ways for players to engage with the game. However, financial services are tightly linked to the free market. The game will face an irreversible loss of players when the market experiences depression. For blockchain games, well-designed gameplay should be the fundamental basis for the long-lasting retention of players.},

abstract = {As blockchain-based commercial projects and startups flourish, efficiency becomes one of the critical metrics in designing blockchain systems. Due to its high efficiency, Proof of Authority (PoA) Aura has become one of the most widely adopted consensus solutions for blockchains. Our research finds over 4,000 projects have used Aura and its variants. In this paper, we provide a rigorous analysis of Aura. We propose three types of time-manipulation attacks, where a malicious leader simply needs to modify the timestamp in its proposed block or delay it to extract extra benefits. These attacks can easily break the legal leader election, thus directly harming the fairness of the block proposal. We apply our attacks to a mature Aura project called OpenEthereum. By repeatedly conducting our attacks1 over 15 days, we find that an adversary can gain on average 200% mining rewards of their fair shares. Furthermore, such attacks can even indirectly break the finality of blocks and the safety of the system. Based on the deployment of Aura as of September 2022, the potentially affected market cap is up to 2.13 billion USD. As a by-product, we further discuss solutions to mitigate such issues and report our observations to official teams.},

abstract = {Blockchain is a distributed ledger technique that guarantees the traceability of transactions. Blockchain is adopted in multiple domains like finance (e.g., cryptocurrency), healthcare, security, and supply chain. In the open-source software (OSS) portal GitHub, we observe a growing adoption of Blockchain-based solutions. Given the rapid emergence of Blockchain-based solutions in our daily life and the evolving cryptocurrency market, it is important to know the status quo, how developers generally interact in those repos, and how much freedom they have in applying code changes. We report an empirical study of 3,664 Blockchain software repositories from GitHub. We divide the Blockchain repositories into two categories: Tool (e.g., SDKs) and Applications (e.g., service/solutions developed using SDKs). The Application category is further divided into two sub-categories: Crypto and Non-Crypto applications. In all Blockchain repository categories, the contribution interactions on commits are the most common interaction type. We found that more organizations contributing to the Blockchain repos than individual users. The median numbers of internal and external users in tools are higher than the application repos. We observed a higher degree of collaboration (e.g., for maintenance efforts) among users in Blockchain tools than those in the application repos. Among the artifacts, issues have a greater number of interactions than commits and pull requests. Related to autonomy we found that less than half of total project contributions are autonomous. Our findings offer implications to Blockchain stakeholders, like developers to stay aware of OSS practices around Blockchain software.},

abstract = {The rapid development of blockchain and cryptocurrency in the past decade has created a huge demand for digital trading platforms. Popular decentralised exchanges (DEXs) such as Uniswap and PancakeSwap were created to address this market gap, facilitating cryptocurrency exchange without intermediaries and hence eliminating security and privacy issues associated with traditional centralised platforms. This, however, due to lack of regulation, results in the emergence of a host of damaging investment fraudulent schemes, including Ponzi, honey pot, pump-and-dump, and rug-pull.In this study, we aim to investigate the problem of detecting rug-pull on Uniswap using supervised learning. We aggregate a list of 23 features and propose the use of a hybrid feature selection technique to find the most relevant features for rug-pull. The classifier, using this refined set of features, outperforms the classifier in the previous studies and achieves an f1-score of 99%, a precision of 97% on non-malicious tokens, and a recall of 99% on malicious tokens. Additionally, we show that the XGBoost classifier, built using these proposed features, can distinguish scam tokens and newly listed tokens, which are often harder to differentiate as they have similar characteristics, and also propose a validation method.},

abstract = {We present an approach to evaluating the carbon-emitting energy provenance of Bitcoin transactions and transaction outputs. Our approach incorporates published global energy production data and existing state-of-the-art estimates of Bitcoin energy consumption into a scoring algorithm for individual mined blocks. We then present two proposals for deriving scores for transactions based on the coinbase origins of the Bitcoin currency values of the transactions' inputs. The first proposal is comparatively simple, and weights coinbase origin contributions to a transaction based on recency in transaction hops from its origin block. The second proposal adjusts the weights of coinbase contributions at each intermediary transaction based on the input and output values of those transactions. Using these methods we are able to associate individual transactions and unspent transaction outputs with specific quantities of atmospheric carbon. Finally, we offer an outline of an incentivization strategy in the form of a blockchain-based carbon-offsetting oracle that would track the creation and exchange of offsets based on the metrics proposed.},

One emerging use case for blockchain is access control, since it solves the problem of trust deficit while being distributed, auditable and private. This paper lists various access control models that have been proposed or implemented on blockchain platforms. It also provides an analysis of the performance of some of these models. Analysis shows that access control models are progressing from the traditional identity-based systems to role/attribute-based systems with observed structural shifts from centralized to decentralized. Key benefits of blockchain-based access control systems noted are improved transparency over access control and logging; improved, more complex policy management; and the possibility to implement access controls in trust-less systems.},

In this study, we explore the usage of LoRaWAN end nodes as traffic sensing sensors to offer a practical traffic management solution. The monitored Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) factor is reported and used in the gateways to assess the traffic of the environment. Our technique utilizes LoRaWAN as a long-range communication technology to provide a large-scale system. In this work, we present a method of using LoRaWAN devices to estimate traffic flows. LoRaWAN end devices then transmit their packets to different gateways. Their RSSI will be affected by the number of cars present on the roadway. We used SVM and clustering methods to classify the approximate number of cars present. This paper details our experiences with the design and real implementation of this system across an area that stretches for miles in urban scenarios. We continuously measured and reported RSSI at different gateways for weeks. Results have shown that if a LoRaWAN end node is placed in an optimal position, up to 96% of correct environment traffic level detection can be obtained. Additionally, we share the lessons learned from such a deployment for traffic sensing.},

abstract = {Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) networks have emerged as a promising solution in the modern electric power transmission network. By leveraging the bidirectional energy trading capabilities of V2G, demand-supply mismatch is managed in wide range of applications. However, performing energy trading decisions at cloud centers leads to increased delay and overhead. The demand to process the 3V's (variety, volume, and velocity) of data generated by V2G with low latency necessitates the usage of edge computing services. Although with the growth of edge computing resources, the trust issue of collaboration also grows among different stakeholders and service providers. Therefore, to deal with the aforementioned issues, this paper presents blockchain and UAV-enabled edge computing based energy trading services for the V2G environment. The decision of selecting a charging station (CS) by an electric vehicle (EV) is processed close to the EV movement via edge nodes. To secure and validate energy trading transactions and automation of the whole system, the blockchain technology is used in the proposal. The result section depicts that the proposed scheme has minimal computational and communicational overhead along with reduced latency in comparison to the existing schemes.},

abstract = {Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD) systems optimize the management of security incidents and facilitate the call for rescue. However, these systems are often heterogeneous and designed to meet the needs of a particular city or region in isolated ways, making them challenging to integrate with CADs from others cities. This integration is necessary to share data and functionalities when there are operations with cooperation between public administration bodies at different levels (local, regional, state, or national). The more CAD systems are integrated, the more difficult this task becomes. For this integration, it is necessary to be concerned with data secrecy for each access level, besides guaranteeing data security and integrity. Blockchain can fulfill these gaps and be a trusted decentralized controller entity based on a consensus mechanism. Therefore, this work-in-progress paper proposes a blockchain strategy for multi-level interoperability in public safety scenarios.},

abstract = {Data traceability with the great serviceability has been widely used in various scenarios. However, the existing traceability mechanism often applies internationally accepted cryptographic algorithms such as MD5 and RSA in the data transmission process. These algorithms have been confirmed to have certain loopholes in security. This paper proposes a traceability system based on SM2, SM3, and SM4 algorithms. We establish a certificate issuance verification mechanism to improve the data transmission security performance of the traceability system based on SM2 and SM3. At the same time, the system uses the SM4 algorithm to design a blockchain interaction scheme using data digest, and uses homomorphic encryption to verify the correctness of the data. In addition, we also replaced the SM2 in the system with the RSA, and the SM3 with the MD5 to test the pros and cons of the two different algorithm systems in terms of security performance and execution efficiency. The test results show that the traceability mechanism based on SM2, SM3, and SM4 performs 1-2 seconds faster than the traceability mechanism based on RSA and MD5 in terms of average transaction response time. At the same time, SM2, SM3, and SM4 also have better security performance.},

abstract = {The use of blockchain in regulatory ecosystems is a promising approach to address challenges of compliance among mutually untrusted entities. In this work, we consider applications of blockchain technologies in telecom regulations. In particular, we address growing concerns around Unsolicited Commercial Communication (UCC aka. spam) sent through text messages (SMS) and phone calls in India. Despite several regulatory measures taken to curb the menace of spam it continues to be a nuisance to subscribers while posing challenges to telecom operators and regulators alike. In this paper, we present a consortium blockchain based architecture to address the problem of UCC in India. Our solution improves subscriber experiences, improves the efficiency of regulatory processes while also positively impacting all stakeholders in the telecom ecosystem. Unlike previous approaches to the problem of UCC, which are all ex-post, our approach to adherence to the regulations is ex-ante. The proposal described in this paper is a primary contributor to the revision of regulations concerning UCC and spam by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). The new regulations published in July 2018 were first of a kind in the world and amended the 2010 Telecom Commercial Communication Customer Preference Regulation (TCCCPR), through mandating the use of a blockchain/distributed ledgers in addressing the UCC problem. In this paper, we provide a holistic account of of the projects’ evolution from (1) its design and strategy, to (2) regulatory and policy action, (3) country wide implementation and deployment, and (4) evaluation and impact of the work. While the scope of the work presented in this paper is in the context of the UCC problem in India, we believe that the approach can be generalized to adopt blockchain based solutions to improve regulatory processes in other contexts and countries. We hope this account will serve as a useful case study for the stakeholders of the telecommunications ecosystem and regulators, and motivate countries across the world facing similar challenges to consider the viability of the technology, be convinced to establish it, continue efforts at addressing active research challenges, and scale the technology from our experiences.},

abstract = {With the global outbreak of COVID-19, hundreds of pneumonias caused by cold chain products occurred worldwide, which seriously threatened the safety of people's lives and properties. To effectively prevent product quality problems caused by cold chain logistics, it is urgent to establish a cold chain logistics traceability system with interoperability of heterogeneous systems, to record, share and track the temperature, location, time, and other specific information. The traditional cold chain logistics traceability systems have many problems, such as broken cold chains, untrustworthy data, and data tampering and sharing, which hinder the coordination and interaction efficiency of cold chain logistics traceability data. This paper creatively proposes a cold chain logistics traceability system framework based on the identification and resolution system for the Industrial Internet. It establishes a general cold chain logistics traceability identification data model. The system framework and data model can effectively solve the difficulties of multi-code identification and multi-source heterogeneous system interaction, to improve the efficiency of cold chain logistics traceability, and ensure the quality of cold chain logistics products.},

abstract = {Players in the building and construction industry have progressively adopted building Information Modelling (BIM) to improve the efficiency of building information management through its rich digital building models used at all building life cycle stages. However, there are still several constraints in the BIM collaboration process and data management regarding data security, accountability, and transparency. On the other hand, blockchain, a distributed ledger technology, is considered a solution to address those constraints. Therefore, this paper aims to integrate blockchain technology into the BIM workflow, focusing on the smart building planning process that holds most data generation of the activities in the whole construction project. To obtain the objectives of this study, literature review, benchmarking study, and expert interviews were conducted in two stages, firstly to identify the characteristics and components of a smart building and then to develop further the blockchain-based framework for smart building planning in the BIM model. By developing the framework that utilizes Ethereum blockchain and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) peer-to-peer storage in Revit BIM client, the results of this study showed that the integration of blockchain in BIM workflow provides an improved platform in terms of data security, accountability, transparency, in which digital signature can be created, and authorization for the models is provided for the planning process of a smart building.},

abstract = {Blockchain Technology's first application is Bitcoin. It started its journey with cryptocurrency in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto. After that, it travelled in many areas such as Government, healthcare, academics, supply chain management, Intellectual property management, social welfare, and energy system. Australia, UAE, Japan are some of the top countries using blockchain technology in various government projects. One can use blockchain technology with decentralised storage of data, which is distributed, immutable, tamper resistance, and securable with a consensus mechanism. Today, many government sectors, organisations, companies, and institutions follow blockchain technology using smart contracts that do not require third-party agreements. We have conducted a systematic survey on blockchain-based digital certification to find the research gap in this research work. We carry out the following: (i) Investigation on the reasons to use the blockchain in education system (ii) Classification of blockchain projects into five categories based on services provided by the projects and platforms used for development (iii) Identification of the services provided by the project and the technologies used for the development.},

abstract = {Source code representation is critical to the machine-learning-based approach to detecting code vulnerability. This paper proposes Compact Abstract Graphs (CAGs) of source code in different programming languages for predicting a broad range of code vulnerabilities with Graph Neural Network (GNN) models. CAGs make the source code representation aligned with the task of vulnerability classification and reduce the graph size to accelerate model training with minimum impact on the prediction performance. We have applied CAGs to six GNN models and large Java/C datasets with 114 vulnerability types in Java programs and 106 vulnerability types in C programs. The experiment results show that the GNN models have performed well, with accuracy ranging from 94.7% to 96.3% on the Java dataset and from 91.6% to 93.2% on the C dataset. The resultant GNN models have achieved promising performance when applied to more than 2,500 vulnerabilities collected from real-world software projects. The results also show that using CAGs for GNN models is significantly better than ASTs, CFGs (Control Flow Graphs), and PDGs (Program Dependence Graphs). A comparative study has demonstrated that the CAG-based GNN models can outperform the existing methods for machine learning-based vulnerability detection.},

abstract = {Centralized networks inevitably exhibit single points of failure that malicious actors regularly target. Decentralized networks are more resilient if numerous participants contribute to the network’s functionality. Most decentralized networks employ incentive mechanisms to coordinate the participation and cooperation of peers and thereby ensure the functionality and security of the network. This article systematically reviews incentive mechanisms for decentralized networks and networked systems by covering 165 prior literature reviews and 178 primary research papers published between 1993 and October 2022. Of the considered sources, we analyze eleven literature reviews and 105 primary research papers in detail by categorizing and comparing the distinctive properties of the presented incentive mechanisms. The reviewed incentive mechanisms establish fairness and reward participation and cooperative behavior. We review work that substitutes central authority through independent and subjective mechanisms run in isolation at each participating peer and work that applies multiparty computation. We use monetary, reputation, and service rewards as categories to differentiate the implementations and evaluate each incentive mechanism’s data management, attack resistance, and contribution model. Further, we highlight research gaps and deficiencies in reproducibility and comparability. Finally, we summarize our assessments and provide recommendations to apply incentive mechanisms to decentralized networks that share computational resources.},

abstract = {In a permissioned blockchain, performance dictates its development, which is substantially influenced by its parameters. However, research on auto-tuning for better performance has somewhat stagnated because of the difficulty posed by distributed parameters; thus, it is possible only with difficulty to propose an effective auto-tuning optimization scheme. To alleviate this issue, we lay a solid basis for our research by first exploring the relationship between parameters and performance in Hyperledger Fabric, a permissioned blockchain, and we propose Athena, a Fabric-based auto-tuning system that can automatically provide parameter configurations for optimal performance. The key of Athena is designing a new Permissioned Blockchain Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (PB-MADDPG) to realize heterogeneous parameter-tuning optimization of different types of nodes in Fabric. Moreover, we select parameters with the most significant impact on accelerating recommendation. In its application to Fabric, a typical permissioned blockchain system, with 12 peers and 7 orderers, Athena achieves a throughput improvement of 470.45% and a latency reduction of 75.66% over the default configuration. Compared with the most advanced tuning schemes (CDBTune, Qtune, and ResTune), our method is competitive in terms of throughput and latency.},

abstract = {Blockchain databases have attracted widespread attention but suffer from poor scalability due to underlying non-scalable blockchains. While blockchain sharding is necessary for a scalable blockchain database, it poses a new challenge named on-chain cross-shard database services. Each cross-shard database service (e.g., cross-shard queries or inter-shard load balancing) involves massive cross-shard data exchanges, while the existing cross-shard mechanisms need to process each cross-shard data exchange via the consensus of all nodes in the related shards (i.e., on-chain) to resist a Byzantine environment of blockchain, which eliminates sharding benefits.To tackle the challenge, this paper presents GriDB, the first scalable blockchain database, by designing a novel off-chain cross-shard mechanism for efficient cross-shard database services. Borrowing the idea of off-chain payments, GriDB delegates massive cross-shard data exchange to a few nodes, each of which is randomly picked from a different shard. Considering the Byzantine environment, the untrusted delegates cooperate to generate succinct proof for cross-shard data exchanges, while the consensus is only responsible for the low-cost proof verification. However, different from payments, the database services' verification has more requirements (e.g., completeness, correctness, freshness, and availability); thus, we introduce several new authenticated data structures (ADS). Particularly, we utilize consensus to extend the threat model and reduce the complexity of traditional accumulator-based ADS for verifiable cross-shard queries with a rich set of relational operators. Moreover, we study the necessity of inter-shard load balancing for a scalable blockchain database and design an off-chain and live approach for both efficiency and availability during balancing. An evaluation of our prototype shows the performance of GriDB in terms of scalability in workloads with queries and updates.},

abstract = {Distributed ledger technology (DLT), including blockchain, has a number of properties that make it useful for distributed systems. However, the immutability of blockchain and most forms of DLT make it impossible to delete data, as is required for compliance with many privacy rules regarding personally identifiable information. Thus, there is a need for DLT that can provide the integrity-preserving property of DLT while also allowing support for privacy rules. The data block matrix (DBM) is a variant of distributed ledger technology. It provides the integrity assurance of blockchain but allows for controlled revision or deletion of data. This property is essential for using DLT in applications that must guarantee privacy requirements by the deleting of a user's private data at their request. The DBM design solves the blockchain privacy conflict thus expanding the range of blockchain applications by also allowing exception management. It has been implemented and is available () as a configurable option for Hyperledger Fabric (HF), with a proof-of-concept application for data sharing in a health care environment. Other potential applications include logistics management and digital currency. This paper will cover the DBM properties and data structure, the DBM implementation in HF, and a use case and application design of the DBM implementation using the pharmaceutical industry supply chain.},

abstract = {Fuzz testing (fuzzing) has witnessed its prosperity in detecting security flaws recently. It generates a large number of test cases and monitors the executions for defects. Fuzzing has detected thousands of bugs and vulnerabilities in various applications. Although effective, there lacks systematic analysis of gaps faced by fuzzing. As a technique of defect detection, fuzzing is required to narrow down the gaps between the entire input space and the defect space. Without limitation on the generated inputs, the input space is infinite. However, defects are sparse in an application, which indicates that the defect space is much smaller than the entire input space. Besides, because fuzzing generates numerous test cases to repeatedly examine targets, it requires fuzzing to perform in an automatic manner. Due to the complexity of applications and defects, it is challenging to automatize the execution of diverse applications. In this article, we systematically review and analyze the gaps as well as their solutions, considering both breadth and depth. This survey can be a roadmap for both beginners and advanced developers to better understand fuzzing.},

The consensus module is used to combine the PBFT consensus algorithm, multi-layer nodes and incentive mechanism to achieve optimization. Furthermore, this paper uses the modules in a personal files system to highlight its usability. Finally, performance experiments show that our design effectively reduces the total consensus delay and the number of consensus communications, solved the shortcomings of the sharp decline in the performance of the alliance chain when the number of nodes increases, and improves its performance and availability.},

abstract = {Payment channels (PC) are a promising solution to the scalability issue of cryptocurrencies, allowing users to perform the bulk of the transactions off-chain without needing to post everything on the blockchain. Many PC proposals however, suffer from a severe limitation: Both parties need to constantly monitor the blockchain to ensure that the other party did not post an outdated transaction. If this event happens, the honest party needs to react promptly and engage in a punishment procedure. This means that prolonged absence periods (e.g., a power outage) may be exploited by malicious users. As a mitigation, the community has introduced watchtowers, a third-party monitoring the blockchain on behalf of off-line users. Unfortunately, watchtowers are either trusted, which is critical from a security perspective, or they have to lock a certain amount of coins, called collateral, for each monitored PC in order to be held accountable, which is financially infeasible for a large network. We present Sleepy Channels, the first bi-directional PC protocol without watchtowers (or any other third party) that supports an unbounded number of payments and does not require parties to be persistently online. The key idea is to confine the period in which PC updates can be validated on-chain to a short, pre-determined time window, which is when the PC parties have to be online. This behavior is incentivized by letting the parties lock a collateral in the PC, which can be adjusted depending on their mutual trust and which they get back much sooner if they are online during this time window. Our protocol is compatible with any blockchain that is capable of verifying digital signatures (e.g., Bitcoin), as shown by our proof of concept. Moreover, our experimental results show that Sleepy Channels impose a communication and computation overhead similar to state-of-the-art PC protocols while removing watchtower's collateral and fees for the monitoring service.},

abstract = {The rapid advances in fitness wearable devices are redefining privacy around interactions. Fitness wearables devices record a considerable amount of sensitive and private details about exercise, blood oxygen level, and heart rate. Privacy concerns have emerged about the interactions between an individual’s raw fitness data and data analysis by the providers of fitness apps and wearable devices. This paper describes the importance of adopting and applying legal frameworks within the fitness tracker ecosystem. In this review, we describe the studies on the current privacy policies of fitness app providers, heuristically evaluate the methods for consent management by fitness providers, summarize the gaps identified in our review of these studies, and discuss potential solutions for filling the gaps identified. We have identified four main problems related to preserving the privacy of users of fitness apps: lack of system transparency, lack of privacy policy legibility, concerns regarding one-time consent, and issues of noncompliance regarding consent management. After discussing feasible solutions, we conclude by describing how blockchain is suitable for solving these privacy issues.},

abstract = {Public cloud platforms have leveraged Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) technology to provide confidential computing services. However, TEE-protected applications still suffer from rollback or forking attacks, in which their states could be rolled back to a stale version or be forked into multiple versions, resulting in state continuity violations. Existing solutions against these attacks either rely on weak threat models based on centralized trust (e.g., trusted server) or suffer from large performance overheads (e.g., tens of state updates per second). In this paper, we propose Narrator, a secure and practical system, (1) that relies on a blockchain (i.e., decentralized trust) and TEEs, and (2) that provides high-performance state continuity protection like unlimited and fast state updates for applications in cloud TEEs. The intuition behind our design is simple. Our design uses the blockchain to initialize a distributed system of TEEs, laying down the decentralized trust base with a small interaction overhead, while the distributed system provides performant state continuity protection. Our distributed system adopts a customized version of the consistent broadcast protocol and leverages advanced techniques to make state updates processed with one round trip delay on average. We build a proof-of-concept of Narrator on Intel SGX (i.e., a representative design of TEEs) and do extensive experiments to evaluate its performance. Our evaluation results show that in a LAN environment with 5 nodes, Narrator can support about 6k state updates per second, meanwhile keeping the latency as low as 3-8 ms. The throughput is 30x larger than that in ROTE and 70x larger than using a TPM counter.},

abstract = {The traditional industrial Internet platform adopts a centralized data storage model, and the security sharing of data generated by terminal devices is a major bottleneck that hinders the development of industrial Internet. Along with the geometric growth of terminal data, protecting the security and integrity of data has become the core research area of the Industrial Internet. Blockchain is distributed, open, transparent and tamper-evident, and can provide a reliable underlying service to realize a distributed data security sharing system. Therefore, this paper proposes a blockchain-based data security sharing model for industrial Internet platforms, with a distributed blockchain network as the core to build up a decentralized data security sharing service. Meanwhile, to address the problems of high consensus latency, low throughput and performance, and no support for node dynamic management of the practical Byzantine fault-tolerant (PBFT) algorithm used in blockchain, a simplified consistency protocol and a new node management mechanism are introduced to achieve dynamic management of nodes while reducing the complexity of algorithm communication.},

abstract = {The beginning of 2020 is associated with the emergence and spread of the COVID-19 disease. The characteristics of this virus, such as high transmission power and lack of definitive treatment have caused problems in all aspects of organizational economics. Restrictions that were imposed to deal with the virus affected the global economy. Fear of being exposed to the virus, quarantine and lockdown led to a massive increase in online shopping. However, people’s concern about the health and authenticity of the products offered online and their incompatibility with consumer standards raised concerns about the reliability of the existing e-commerce models. Fraud, counterfeit products, ethical sourcing and product safety are some of the concerns that affected online business acceptance. To address these challenges, we examine the use of a blockchain-based e-commerce approach to guarantee authenticity through blockchains trace and trace capabilities. In this approach, we evaluate the profit gains achieved through addressing consumer concerns on safety and authenticity. To examine these benefits, we use a game theory leader-follower approach. We evaluate the profitability of e-commerce in three scenarios, including when non of seller and e-commerce website use blockchain, only when the seller uses the blockchain and when both the seller and the e-commerce websites use blockchain. The evaluation results show that the situation in which both the seller and the website use blockchain has the highest profitability for the seller due to the maximum reduction of customer concerns.},

The critical civil and military domains include, but are not limited to, battlefield, healthcare, transportation, and rescue missions. Given the sensitive nature and modernization of tactical domains, the security of C3I systems has recently become a critical concern. This is because cyber-attacks on C3I systems have catastrophic consequences including loss of human lives. Despite the increasing number of cyber-attacks on C3I systems and growing concerns about C3I systems’ security, there is a paucity of a comprehensive review to systematize the body of knowledge on the security of C3I systems. Therefore, in this article, we have gathered, analyzed, and synthesized the body of knowledge on the security of C3I systems. We have identified and reported security vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and countermeasures/defenses for C3I systems. In particular, this article has enabled us to (i) propose a taxonomy for security vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and countermeasures; (ii) interrelate attack vectors with security vulnerabilities and countermeasures; and (iii) propose future research directions for advancing the state-of-the-art on the security of C3I systems. We believe that our findings will serve as a guideline for practitioners and researchers to advance the state-of-the-practice and state-of-the-art on the security of C3I systems.},

abstract = {Upon its arrival, the Ethereum blockchain promised to introduce a new paradigm of Internet-based applications that would revolutionize multiple fields, from finance to IoT to the public sector. Until now, scientific efforts have been primarily focused on theoretical discussions about the implications of the technology and on technical proposals to improve and consolidate the underlying infrastructure, neglecting the experience of people using blockchain-based systems. However, for this technology to permeate the mainstream, blockchain technology should be easily accessible to the general public. This paper reports on evaluations conducted with first-time blockchain users of two Internet-mediated communities using prototype applications built on Ethereum. Results unveil that even users familiar with technology experienced severe difficulties using blockchain-based apps. Also, we saw how blockchain metaphors and transaction-mediated interactions challenge established mental models for modern applications, imposing heavy workloads on users. We conclude the paper by discussing design implications resulting from blockchain’s paradigm change.},

abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) is a promising technology for cloud-edge collaborative computing in Industrial Internet of Things. Its hierarchical framework is compatible with cloud-edge collaboration and can keep the raw data locally by way of preserving privacy. However, the defect of FL is that it may be tampered with by malicious nodes and suffer attacks during the model transmission between client and server. To address this issue, we propose a new Scalable Blockchain Secure Federated learning (SBSF) architecture. First, the scheme of blockchain combined with the Feldman verifiable secret sharing is designed to ensure the model secure storage and defend attacks in the model transmission of FL. Then, a scalable blockchain in terms of off-chain storage supported by InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) put forward to meet the increasing storage demand in cloud-edge collaboration IIoT. Last but not least, in the process of block generation, an optimized Raft consensus algorithm Named-data Networking (NDN)-based is raised to improve the blockchain network transmission efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SBSF which outperforms baseline in promoting storage scalability and guaranteeing efficiency and accuracy.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of embedded smart devices, a new data collection paradigm, mobile crowd-sensing (MCS), has been proposed. MCS allows individuals from the crowd to act as sensors and contribute their observation data. However, existing MCS systems are mostly based on third-party platforms, and there is no guarantee that a center is completely credible. In addition, security and privacy issues should not be ignored. During MCS’ execution, the participants’ various information and truth value are usually exposed, and the computation related to data privacy cannot be verified. In this paper, we integrate the blockchain into the MCS scenario to design a blockchain based privacy-preserving quality control mechanism, which prevents data from being tampered with, and denied, ensuring that the reward is distributed fairly. In the new system, we propose a privacy preserving participant selection scheme and the result can be verified (i.e., security against malicious node) without any third-party arbiter. Finally, considering the issues with sensing data privacy and efficiency in the truth discovery process, we propose a new privacy-aware crowdsensing design with iterative truth discovery based on rational secure multi-party computation. The experimental results show that compared to the prior result, the proposed solutions are highly practical and facilitate quality control without violating the participant’s privacy.},

NFT-related content has been widely shared on social media sites such as Twitter. We aim to understand the dominant factors that influence NFT asset valuation. Towards this objective, we create a first-of-its-kind dataset linking Twitter and OpenSea (the largest NFT marketplace) to capture social media profiles and linked NFT assets. Our dataset contains 245,159 tweets posted by 17,155 unique users, directly linking 62,997 NFT assets on OpenSea worth 19 Million USD. We have made the dataset publicly available.1We analyze the growth of NFTs, characterize the Twitter users promoting NFT assets, and gauge the impact of Twitter features on the virality of an NFT. Further, we investigate the effectiveness of different social media and NFT platform features by experimenting with multiple machine learning and deep learning models to predict an asset’s value. We model the problem as a binary classification as well as an ordinal classification task. Our results show that social media features improve the ordinal classification accuracy by 6% over baseline models that use only NFT platform features. Among social media features, count of user membership lists, number of likes and replies are important features. On the other hand, OpenSea features like offer entered, bids withdrawn, bid entered and is presale turn out to be important predictors.},

However, the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant algorithm (PBFT) is not suitable for large-scale supply chain due to its poor scalability, arbitrary selection of master nodes and simple grouping. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a Re-PBFT algorithm (Reputation-PBFT, Re-PBFT) based on reputation-value assessment group. Firstly, the reputation value of the node is evaluated according to the historical transaction record of the node. Secondly, the nodes are grouped according to their reputation value, and the nodes with high reputation value are selected as the master nodes to construct a double-layer PBFT algorithm to improve their efficiency in multi-node situation. Finally, the impeachment mechanism is established to optimize the nodes of the consensus group. Experimental results show that Re-PBFT algorithm has higher scalability and reliability than PBFT algorithm, and the efficiency of the algorithm is also improved.},

However, significant issues w.r.t. system throughput, transaction confidentiality, and the security guarantee of the DApp transaction execution and order correctness hinder the border adoption of blockchain DApps.To address these issues, we propose L2chain, a novel blockchain framework aiming to scale the system through a layer-2 network where DApps process transactions in the layer-2 network and only the system state digest, acting as the state integrity proof, is maintained on-chain. To achieve high performance, we introduce the split-execute-merge (SEM) transaction processing workflow with the help of the RSA accumulator, allowing DApps to lock and update a part of the state digest in parallel. We also design a witness cache mechanism for DApp executors to reduce the transaction processing latency. To fulfill confidentiality, we leverage the trusted execution environment (TEE) for DApps to execute encrypted transactions off-chain. To ensure transaction execution and order correctness, we propose a two-step execution process for DApps to prevent attacks (i.e., rollback attacks) from subverting the state transition. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that L2chain can achieve 1.5X to 42.2X and 7.1X to 8.9X throughput improvements in permissioned and permissionless settings respectively.},

However, it is not clear whether voting preferences in the virtual world will mirror real-world voting preferences. We present a within-subject study in which participants were asked to allocate voting power in two scenarios. The first scenario probed participants’ opinion about the divisibility of voting rights. The second scenario presented participants with the case of unequal allocation of voting power in a virtual world, enforced by smart contracts. In both scenarios, participants allocated voting power and rated the fairness of their decision. Our study finds that participants’ voting preferences in the virtual world scenario did not mirror their real-world preferences and beliefs. Voting systems in the metaverse need to be carefully designed to align with human values and ethics.},

Although classic distributed consensus algorithms made significant contributions to the development of blockchain consensus protocols, there are still many issues to be resolved due to the complexity and diversity of the blockchain. In this survey, we summarize the state-of-the-art blockchain consensus protocols. We first introduce the theoretical basis, models, and challenges of blockchain consensus protocols. Then, we present the existing blockchain protocols in the categories of proof-based protocols, committee-based protocols, and other miscellaneous protocols. Finally, we analyze their performance and discuss future research directions by comparing existing protocols.},

abstract = {Networked edge servers constitute an edge storage system in edge computing (EC). Upon users’ requests, data must be delivered from edge servers in the system or from the cloud to users. Existing studies of edge storage systems have unfortunately neglected the fact that an excessive number of users accessing the same edge server for data may impact users’ data rates seriously due to the wireless interference. Thus, users must first be allocated to edge servers properly for ensuring their data rates. After that, requested data can be delivered to users to minimize their average data delivery latency. In this paper, we formulate this Interference-aware Data Delivery at the network Edge (IDDE) problem, and demonstrate its NP-hardness. To tackle it effectively and efficiently, we propose IDDE-G, a novel approach that first finds a Nash equilibrium as the strategy for allocating users. Then, it finds an approximate strategy for delivering requested data to allocated users. We analyze the performance of IDDE-G theoretically and evaluate its performance experimentally to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of IDDE-G on solving the IDDE problem.},

abstract = {SwissCovid is the Swiss digital contact tracing app, which was deployed to help fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic. After a year of activity, it is high time to evaluate how effective it has been in its mission. At the highest peak, about 22% of the Swiss population was actively using SwissCovid. The activity of SwissCovid follows the curve on the number of COVID-19 cases. However, performances are rather poor. About 1% of the cases may have been discovered by SwissCovid and much less than 2% of SwissCovid alerts may have been useful, while SwissCovid generates 5% of the quarantines. The measure of the proximity of each encounter and its duration are also imprecise. It further comes with security and privacy issues: adversaries can inject false alerts for SwissCovid users and users can be tracked. On top of that, SwissCovid contributes to strengthen the monopoly of Apple and Google and to make users and their data captive of these giants. It also digs the digital divide. Contrarily to the original plan, the implementation is not open source and the law was twisted to fit the constraints by Apple and Google. Therefore, SwissCovid did not meet its goals.},

One of the biggest challenges facing the clinical trial research community is satisfying Part 11 of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations [7] and ISO 27789 [40]. These controls provide audit requirements that guarantee the reliability of the data contained in the electronic records. Context-aware smart devices and wearable IoT devices have become increasingly common in clinical trials. Electronic Data Capture (EDC) and Clinical Data Management Systems (CDMS) do not currently address the new challenges introduced using these devices. The healthcare digital threat landscape is continually evolving, and the prevalence of sensor fusion and wearable devices compounds the growing attack surface. We propose Scrybe, a permissioned blockchain, to store proof of clinical trial data provenance. We illustrate how Scrybe addresses each control and the limitations of the Ethereum-based blockchains.

Some activities are due to the exploitation of vulnerabilities which are present in the blockchain infrastructure, some activities target its users through social engineering techniques, while some activities use it to facilitate different malicious activities. Since cryptocurrency-based permissionless blockchains provide pseudonymity to its users, bad actors prefer to carry out transactions related to malicious activities on them. Towards this, we aim at automatically flagging blockchain accounts as suspects that indulge in malicious activities, thus reducing the unintended support that cryptocurrency-based permissionless blockchains provide to malicious actors. We first use the cosine similarity (CS) metrics to study the similarities between the feature vector of accounts associated with different malicious activities and find that most of the malicious activities associated with the Ethereum blockchain behave similarly. We then use the K-Means clustering algorithm to check if accounts associated with similar malicious activities cluster together. We also study the effect of bias on the performance of a machine learning (ML) algorithm, due to the number of accounts associated with malicious activity. We then compare the different state-of-the-art models and identify that Neural Networks (NNs) are resistant to bias associated with a malicious activity and are also robust against adversarial attacks. The previously used ML algorithms for identifying malicious accounts also show bias towards an over-represented malicious activity.},

abstract = {With the rapid growth of the Internet, human daily life has become deeply bound to the Internet. To take advantage of massive amounts of data and information on the internet, the Web architecture is continuously being reinvented and upgraded. From the static informative characteristics of Web 1.0 to the dynamic interactive features of Web 2.0, scholars and engineers have worked hard to make the internet world more open, inclusive, and equal. Indeed, the next generation of Web evolution (i.e., Web 3.0) is already coming and shaping our lives. Web 3.0 is a decentralized Web architecture that is more intelligent and safer than before. The risks and ruin posed by monopolists or criminals will be greatly reduced by a complete reconstruction of the Internet and IT infrastructure. In a word, Web 3.0 is capable of addressing web data ownership according to distributed technology. It will optimize the internet world from the perspectives of economy, culture, and technology. Then it promotes novel content production methods, organizational structures, and economic forms. However, Web 3.0 is not mature and is now being disputed. Herein, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of Web 3.0, with a focus on current technologies, challenges, opportunities, and outlook. This article first introduces a brief overview of the history of World Wide Web as well as several differences among Web 1.0, Web 2.0, Web 3.0, and Web3. Then, some technical implementations of Web 3.0 are illustrated in detail. We discuss the revolution and benefits that Web 3.0 brings. Finally, we explore several challenges and issues in this promising area.},

abstract = {Nowadays, Online Social Media (OSM) are among the most popular web services. Traditional OSM are known to be affected by serious issues including misinformation, fake news, censorship, and privacy violations, to the point that a pressing demand for new paradigms is raised by users all over the world. Among such paradigms, the concepts around the Web 3.0 are fueling a new revolution of online sociality, pushing towards the adoption of innovative and groundbreaking technologies. In particular, the decentralization of social services through the blockchain technology is representing the most valid alternative to current OSM, enabling the development of rewarding strategies for value redistribution, and fake news detection. However, the so-called Blockchain Online Social Media (BOSMs) are far from being mature, with different platforms that continually try to redefine their services in order to attract larger audiences, thus causing blockchain forks and massive user migrations, with the latter dominating the dynamics of the current OSM landscape, too. In this paper, we deal with the evolution of BOSMs from the perspective of user migration across platforms as a consequence of a fork event. We propose a general user migration model applicable to BOSMs to represent the evolution patterns of fork-based migrations, the multi-interaction structural complexity of BOSMs, and their growth characteristics. Within this framework, we also cope with the task of predicting how users will behave in the case of a fork, i.e. they will remain on the original blockchain or they will migrate to the new one. We apply our framework to the case study of the Steem-Hive fork event, and show the importance of considering both social and economic information, regardless of the learning algorithm considered. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on blockchain fork and its related user migration.},

abstract = {Coin mixing services allow users to mix their cryptocurrency coins and thus enable unlinkable payments in a way that prevents tracking of honest users' coins by both the service provider and the users themselves. The easy bootstrapping of new users and backwards compatibility with cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin) with limited support for scripts are attractive features of this architecture, which has recently gained considerable attention in both academia and industry.A recent work of Tairi et al. [IEEE S&amp;P 2021] formalizes the notion of a coin mixing service and proposes A2L, a new cryptographic protocol that simultaneously achieves high efficiency and interoperability. In this work, we identify a gap in their formal model and substantiate the issue by showing two concrete counterexamples: we show how to construct two encryption schemes that satisfy their definitions but lead to a completely insecure system. To amend this situation, we investigate secure constructions of coin mixing services. First, we develop the notion of blind conditional signatures (BCS), which acts as the cryptographic core for coin mixing services. We propose game-based security definitions for BCS and propose A2L+, a modified version of the protocol by Tairi et al. that satisfies our security definitions. Our analysis is in an idealized model (akin to the algebraic group model) and assumes the hardness of the one-more discrete logarithm problem. Finally, we propose A2L-UC, another construction of BCS that achieves the stronger notion of UC-security (in the standard model), albeit with a significant increase in computation cost. This suggests that constructing a coin mixing service protocol secure under composition requires more complex cryptographic machinery than initially thought.},

abstract = {As the demand for taxi reservation services has increased, increasing the income of taxi drivers with advanced services has attracted attention. In this article, we propose a path decision framework that considers real-time spatial-temporal predictions and traffic network information. The goal is to optimize a taxi driver's profit when considering a reservation. Our framework contains four components. First, we build a grid-based road network graph for modeling traffic network information for speeding up the search process. Next, we conduct two prediction modules that adopt advanced deep learning techniques to guide proper search directions for recommending cruising locations. One module of the taxi demand prediction is used to estimate the pick-up probabilities of passengers in the city. Another one is destination prediction, which can predict the distribution of drop-off probabilities and capture the flow of potential passengers. Finally, we propose the H* (Heuristic-star) algorithm, which jointly considers pick-up probabilities, drop-off distribution, road network, distance, and time factors based on the attentive heuristic function to dynamically recommend next cruising locations. Compared with existing route planning methods, the experimental results on a real-world dataset have shown that our proposed approach is more effective and robust. Moreover, our designed search scheme in H* can decrease the computing time and allow the search process to be more efficient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that focuses on guiding a route, which can increase the income of taxi drivers under the constraint of booking information.},

abstract = {Most NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) use multi-hop URLs to address the off-chain assets due to the costly on-chain storage, but the path from NFTs to the underlying assets is fraught with instability, which may degrade its value. Hence, this paper aims to answer the question: Is the NFT-to-Asset connection fragile? This paper makes a first step towards this end by characterizing NFT-to-Asset connections of 12,353 Ethereum NFT Contracts (6,234,141 NFTs in total) from three perspectives, storage, accessibility, and duplication. In order to overcome challenges of affecting the measurement accuracy, e.g., IPFS instability and the changing availability of both IPFS and servers’ data, we propose to leverage multiple gateways to enlarge the data coverage and extend a longer measurement period with non-trivial efforts. Results of our extensive study show that such connection is very fragile in practice. The loss, unavailability, or duplication of off-chain assets could render the value of NFTs worthless. For instance, we find that assets of 25.24% of Ethereum NFT contracts are not accessible, and 21.48% of Ethereum NFT contracts include duplicated assets. Our work sheds light on the fragility along the NFT-to-Asset connection, which could help the NFT community to better enhance the trust of off-chain assets.},

abstract = {The increasing popularity of WebAssembly creates a demand for understanding and reverse engineering WebAssembly binaries. Recovering high-level function types is an important part of this process. One method to recover types is data-flow analysis, but it is complex to implement and may require manual heuristics when logical constraints fall short. In contrast, this paper presents SnowWhite, a learning-based approach for recovering precise, high-level parameter and return types for WebAssembly functions. It improves over prior work on learning-based type recovery by representing the types-to-predict in an expressive type language, which can describe a large number of complex types, instead of the fixed, and usually small type vocabulary used previously. Thus, recovery of a single type is no longer a classification task but sequence prediction, for which we build on the success of neural sequence-to-sequence models. We evaluate SnowWhite on a new, large-scale dataset of 6.3 million type samples extracted from 300,905 WebAssembly object files. The results show the type language is expressive, precisely describing 1,225 types instead the 7 to 35 types considered in previous learning-based approaches. Despite this expressiveness, our type recovery has high accuracy, exactly matching 44.5% (75.2%) of all parameter types and 57.7% (80.5%) of all return types within the top-1 (top-5) predictions.},

abstract = {We provide optimized range proofs, called Sharp, in discrete logarithm and hidden order groups, based on square decomposition. In the former setting, we build on the paradigm of Couteau et al. (Eurocrypt '21) and optimize their range proof (from now on, CKLR) in several ways: (1) We introduce batching via vector commitments and an adapted ∑;-protocol. (2) We introduce a new group switching strategy to reduce communication. (3) As repetitions are necessary to instantiate CKLR in standard groups, we provide a novel batch shortness test that allows for cheaper repetitions. The analysis of our test is nontrivial and forms a core technical contribution of our work. For example, for λ = 128 bit security and B = 64 bit ranges for N = 1 (resp. N = 8) proof(s), we reduce the proof size by 34% (resp. 75%) in arbitrary groups, and by 66% (resp. 88%) in groups of order 256-bit, compared to CKLR.As Sharp and CKLR proofs satisfy a "relaxed" notion of security, we show how to enhance their security with one additional hidden order group element. In RSA groups, this reduces the size of state of the art range proofs (Couteau et al., Eurocrypt '17) by 77% (λ = 128, B = 64, N = 1).Finally, we implement our most optimized range proof. Compared to the state of the art Bulletproofs (B\"{u}nz et al., S&amp;P 2018), our benchmarks show a very significant runtime improvement. Eventually, we sketch some applications of our new range proofs.},

abstract = {A distributed and reliable source of randomness is always a critical element in cryptography, both in the construction and application of cryptographic primitives. Modern cryptography such as blockchain, cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance is heavily dependent on a trusted randomness source. In particular, Decentralized Randomness Beacon (DRB) protocols can be a reliable source of randomness. A DRB protocol generates a continuous stream of publicly verifiable random values. Almost all the available DRB protocols are collaborative in nature where participants of a DRB protocol collaborate their local entropy to generate global randomness.A DRB protocol can also be competitive where the participants compete to generate the global randomness. RANDCHAIN (ePrint 2020/1033) is the first Competitive Decentralized Randomness Beacon Protocol. Although RANDCHAIN claims to provide fairness and scalability, it still has a few problems concerning blockchain-oriented attacks and fairness to the participants. Therefore, to solve the existing problems of RANDCHAIN, we present a general model to construct competitive DRB protocols. Our competitive DRB model is a composition of committee selection strategy followed by a moderately hard cryptographic puzzle. To provide different levels of fairness, we present a variety of committee selection strategies. Our competitive DRB protocols provide better fairness, linear communication complexity, and better scalability compared to the existing DRB protocols.},

abstract = {Sealed bid auctions are used to allocate a resource among a set of interested parties. Traditionally, auctions need the presence of a trusted auctioneer to whom the bidders provide their private bid values. Existence of such a trusted party is not an assumption easily realized in practice. Generic secure computation protocols can be used to remove a trusted party. However, generic techniques result in inefficient protocols, and typically do not provide fairness -- that is, a corrupt party can learn the output and abort the protocol thereby preventing other parties from learning the output. At CRYPTO 2009, Miltersen, Nielsen and Triandopoulos~citeC:MilNieTri09, introduced the problem of building auctions that are secure against rational bidders. Such parties are modeled as self-interested agents who care more about maximizing their utility than about learning information about bids of other agents. To realize this, they put forth a novel notion of information utility and introduce a game-theoretic framework that helps analyse protocols while taking into account both information utility as well as monetary utility. Unfortunately, their construction makes use a of generic MPC protocol and, consequently, the authors do not analyze the concrete efficiency of their protocol. In this work, we construct the first concretely efficient and provably secure protocol for First Price Auctions in therational setting. Our protocol guarantees privacy, public verifiability and fairness. Inspired by~citeC:MilNieTri09, we put forth a solution concept that we callPrivacy Enhanced Computational Weakly Dominant Strategy Equilibrium that captures parties' privacy and monetary concerns in the game theoretic context, and show that our protocol realizes this. We believe this notion to be of independent interest. Our protocol is crafted specifically for the use case of auctions, is simple, using off-the-shelf cryptographic components. Executing our auction protocol on commodity hardware with 30 bidders, with bids of length 10, our protocol runs to completion in 0.429s and has total communication of 82KB.},

abstract = {Adversaries in cryptography have traditionally been modeled as either semi-honest or malicious. Over the years, however, several works have investigated the design of cryptographic protocols against rational adversaries. The most well-known example are covert adversaries in secure computation (Aumann &amp; Lindell, TCC '07) which are adversaries that wish to deviate from the protocol but without being detected. Protocols secure against such covert adversaries guarantee that deviations are detected with probability at least - which is known as the deterrence factor.In this work, we initiate the study of contracts in cryptographic protocol design. We show how to design, use and analyze contracts between parties for the purpose of incentivizing honest behavior from rational adversaries. We refer to such contracts as adversarial level agreements (ALA). The framework we propose can result in more efficient protocols and can enforce deterrence in covert protocols; meaning that one can guarantee that a given deterrence factor will deter the adversary instead of assuming it.We show how to apply our framework to two-party protocols, including secure two-party computation (2PC) and proofs of storage (PoS). In the 2PC case, we integrate ALAs to publicly-verifiable covert protocols and show, through a game-theoretic analysis, how to set the parameters of the ALA to guarantee honest behavior. We do the same for PoS which are two-party protocols that allow a client to efficiently verify the integrity of a file stored in the cloud.},

However, the contradiction between the high Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of massive data and the limited network bandwidth and the heterogeneous network is becoming deeper and deeper. The heterogeneity of smart factory networks brings many challenges to unified access and fusion, real-time transmission, and centralized control and management. This article provides a survey on heterogeneous networks in smart factories. We first study and discuss the heterogeneity of smart factory networks, and then discuss the existing mainstream wired and wireless network technologies, as well as promising future technologies, including 5G, OLE for Process Control Unified Architecture (OPC UA), and Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). In addition, we also analyze current heterogeneous network fusion architecture and discuss the enabling technologies of heterogeneous network fusion in view of the shortcoming of the current solutions. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of open challenges and future research directions towards the effective realization of the smart factory.},

abstract = {Cryptographic accumulators are a common solution to proving information about a large set S. They allow one to compute a short digest of S and short certificates of some of its basic properties, notably membership of an element. Accumulators also allow one to track set updates: a new accumulator is obtained by inserting/deleting a given element. In this work we consider the problem of generating membership and update proofs for em batches of elements so that we can succinctly prove additional properties of the elements (i.e., proofs are of constant size regardless of the batch size), and we can preserve privacy. Solving this problem would allow obtaining blockchain systems with improved privacy and scalability. The state-of-the-art approach to achieve this goal is to combine accumulators (typically Merkle trees) with zkSNARKs. This solution is however expensive for provers and does not scale for large batches of elements. In particular, there is no scalable solution for proving batch membership proofs when we require zero-knowledge (a standard definition of privacy-preserving protocols). In this work we propose new techniques to efficiently use zkSNARKs with RSA accumulators. We design and implement two main schemes: 1) harisa, which proves batch membership in zero-knowledge; 2) insarisa, which proves batch updates. For batch membership, the prover in harisa is orders of magnitude faster than existing approaches based on Merkle trees (depending on the hash function). For batch updates we get similar cost savings compared to approaches based on Merkle trees; we also improve over the recent solution of Ozdemir et al. [USENIX'20].},

On the one hand, the unprecedented changes in the threat landscape place demands for securing provenance information to facilitate its trustworthiness. With the recent growth of provenance studies in security, in this work, we examine the role of data provenance in security and privacy. To set this work in context, we outline fundamental principles and models of data provenance and explore how the existing studies achieve security principles.

abstract = {Byzantine consensus is a critical component in many permissioned Blockchains and distributed ledgers. We propose a new paradigm for designing BFT protocols called DQBFT that addresses three major performance and scalability challenges that plague past protocols: (i) high communication costs to reach geo-distributed agreement, (ii) uneven resource utilization hampering performance, and (iii) performance degradation under varying node and network conditions and high-contention workloads. Specifically, DQBFT divides consensus into two parts: 1) durable command replication without a global order, and 2) consistent global ordering of commands across all replicas. DQBFT achieves this by decentralizing the heavy task of replicating commands while centralizing the ordering process.Under the new paradigm, we develop a new protocol, Destiny that uses a combination of three techniques to achieve high performance and scalability: using a trusted subsystem to decrease consensus's quorum size, using threshold signatures to attain linear communication costs, reducing client communication. Our evaluations on 300-replica geo-distributed deployment reveal that DQBFT protocols achieve significant performance gains over prior art: ≈3x better throughput and ≈50% better latency.},

abstract = {Most blockchain-based cryptocurrencies suffer from a heavily limited transaction throughput, which is a barrier to their growing adoption. Payment channel networks (PCNs) are one of the promising solutions to this problem. PCNs reduce the on-chain load of transactions and increase the throughput by processing many payments off-chain. In fact, any two users connected via a path of payment channels (i.e., joint addresses between the two channel end-points) can perform payments, and the underlying blockchain is used only when there is a dispute between users. Unfortunately, payments in PCNs can only be conducted securely along a path, which prevents the design of many interesting applications. Moreover, the most widely used implementation, the Lightning Network in Bitcoin, suffers from a collateral lock time linear in the path length, it is affected by security issues, and it relies on specific scripting features called Hash Timelock Contracts that hinders the applicability of the underlying protocol in other blockchains.In this work, we present Thora, the first Bitcoin-compatible off-chain protocol that enables the atomic update of arbitrary channels (i.e., not necessarily forming a path). This enables the design of a number of new off-chain applications, such as payments across different PCNs sharing the same blockchain, secure and trustless crowdfunding, and channel rebalancing. Our construction requires no specific scripting functionalities other than digital signatures and timelocks, thereby being applicable to a wider range of blockchains. We formally define security and privacy in the Universal Composability framework and show that our cryptographic protocol is a realization thereof. In our performance evaluation, we show that our construction requires only constant collateral, independently from the number of channels, and has only a moderate off-chain communication as well as computation overhead.},

The peer-to-peer distributed ledger platform connects organizations and car owners with disparate interests and hidden intentions. While previous literature has chiefly examined incentives for permissionless platforms, we leverage studies about crowdsensing applications to stimulate research on incentives in permissioned blockchains. This article uses the action design research approach to create an incentive system featuring a rating mechanism influenced by data correction measures. Furthermore, we propose relying on certain institutions capable of assessing data generated within the system. This combined approach of a decentralized data correction and an institutionalized data assessment is distinct from similar incentive systems suggested by literature. By using an agent-based model with strategy evolution, we evaluate the proposed incentive system. Our findings indicate that a rating-based revenue distribution leads to markedly higher data quality in the system. Additionally, the incentive system reveals hidden information of the agents and alleviates agency problems, contributing to an understanding of incentive design in inter-organizational blockchain-based data platforms. Furthermore, we explore incentive design in permissioned blockchains and discuss its latest implications.},

We have investigated 2,500+ in the wild projects and selected 10+ as our main focus (covering Ethereum, Binance smart chain, etc.). We have identified two types of order manipulation attacks to separately break the transaction-level (a.k.a. transaction ordering) and the block-level (sealer position ordering) fairness. Both of them merely rely on honest-but-profitable sealer assumption without modifying original settings. We launch these attacks on the forked branches under an isolated environment and carefully evaluate the attacking scope towards different implementations. To date (as of Nov 2021), the potentially affected PoA market cap can reach up to 681,087 million USD. Besides, we further dive into the source code of selected projects, and accordingly, propose our recommendation for the fix. To the best of knowledge, this work provides the first exploration of the unfairness issue in PoA algorithms.},

Existing literature focused on one of the features mentioned before, while we considered all of them. Our systematic study shows that there is a considerable variety of attack vectors, which we have divided into six subcategories, (i) Memory and Storage, (ii) Operating Systems, (iii) Software Layer, (iv) Network Layer, (v) Blockchain Protocol, and (vi) Others.

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is impacting the world’s connectivity landscape. More and more IoT devices are connected, bringing many benefits to our daily lives. However, the influx of IoT devices poses non-trivial challenges for the existing cloud-based computing paradigm. In the cloud-based architecture, a large amount of IoT data is transferred to the cloud for data management, analysis, and decision making. It could not only cause a heavy workload on the cloud but also result in unacceptable network latency, ultimately undermining the benefits of cloud-based computing. To address these challenges, researchers are looking for new computing models for the IoT. Edge computing, a new decentralized computing model, is valued by more and more researchers in academia and industry. The main idea of edge computing is placing data processing in near-edge devices instead of remote cloud servers. It is promising to build more scalable, low-latency IoT systems. Many studies have been proposed on edge computing and IoT, but a comprehensive survey of this crossover area is still lacking.In this survey, we first introduce the impact of edge computing on the development of IoT and point out why edge computing is more suitable for IoT than other computing paradigms. Then, we analyze the necessity of systematical investigation on the edge-computing-driven IoT (ECDriven-IoT) and summarize new challenges occurring in ECDriven-IoT. We categorize recent advances from bottom to top, covering six aspects of ECDriven-IoT. Finally, we conclude lessons learned and propose some challenging},

However, these conventional wireless technologies are insufficient to meet the high throughput, latency, and reliability of emerging vertical services such as autonomous vehicles, metaverse, and holographic communications. These emerging novel services not only exchange data but also critically rely on accurate information about the surrounding environment for their operation. Moving to mmWave/THz frequencies and beyond, integrating communication and sensing, embedding artificial intelligence into wireless networks, etc., are essential for future wireless networks.

abstract = {State-separating proofs (SSP) is a recent methodology for structuring game-based cryptographic proofs in a modular way, by using algebraic laws to exploit the modular structure of composed protocols. While promising, this methodology was previously not fully formalized and came with little tool support. We address this by introducing SSProve, the first general verification framework for machine-checked state-separating proofs. SSProve combines high-level modular proofs about composed protocols, as proposed in SSP, with a probabilistic relational program logic for formalizing the lower-level details, which together enable constructing machine-checked cryptographic proofs in the Coq proof assistant. Moreover, SSProve is itself fully formalized in Coq, including the algebraic laws of SSP, the soundness of the program logic, and the connection between these two verification styles. To illustrate SSProve we use it to mechanize the simple security proofs of ElGamal and PRF-based encryption. We also validate the SSProve approach by conducting two more substantial case studies: First, we mechanize an SSP security proof of the KEM-DEM public key encryption scheme, which led to the discovery of an error in the original paper proof that has since been fixed. Second, we use SSProve to formally prove security of the sigma-protocol zero-knowledge construction, and we moreover construct a commitment scheme from a sigma-protocol to compare with a similar development in CryptHOL. We instantiate the security proof for sigma-protocols to give concrete security bounds for Schnorr’s sigma-protocol.},

ASPLOS ’23 features 3 deadlines spaced throughout the year and papers will be published in three volumes. Multiple deadlines are meant to encourage authors to submit their papers when ready and to facilitate the selection of some papers for revision. For this volume of ASPLOS ’23, we discontinued the use of the 2-page extended abstract submissions that were used in ASPLOS ’21 and ASPLOS ’22. We found the extended abstract offered limited filtering and moved to a more traditional two phase review process. Each paper received 3 reviews in phase 1 and papers with positive scores advanced to the second round and received up to 2 more reviews. In our preface to Volume III, we will give a more detailed rundown of how the process worked.},
