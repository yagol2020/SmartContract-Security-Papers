abstract = {Smart contracts are gaining popularity as a means to support transparent, traceable, and self-executing decentralized applications, which enable the exchange of value in a trustless environment. Developers of smart contracts rely on various libraries, such as OpenZeppelin for Solidity contracts, to improve application quality and reduce development costs. The API documentations of these libraries are important sources of information for developers who are unfamiliar with the APIs. Yet, maintaining high-quality documentations is non-trivial, and errors in documentations may place barriers for developers to learn the correct usages of APIs. In this paper, we propose a technique, DocCon, to detect inconsistencies between documentations and the corresponding code for Solidity smart contract libraries. Our fact-based approach allows inconsistencies of different severity levels to be queried, from a database containing precomputed facts about the API code and documentations. DocCon successfully detected high-priority API documentation errors in popular smart contract libraries, including mismatching parameters, missing requirements, outdated descriptions, etc. Our experiment result shows that DocCon achieves good precision and is applicable to different libraries: 29 and 22 out of our reported 40 errors have been confirmed and fixed by library developers so far.},

abstract = {Learning smart contract representations can greatly facilitate the development of smart contracts in many tasks such as bug detection and clone detection. Existing approaches for learning program representations are difficult to apply to smart contracts which have insufficient data and significant homogenization. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose SRCL, a novel, self-supervised approach for learning smart contract representations. Unlike existing supervised methods, which are tied on task-specific data labels, SRCL leverages large-scale unlabeled data by self-supervised learning of both local and global information of smart contracts. It automatically extracts structural sequences from abstract syntax trees (ASTs). Then, two discriminators are designed to guide the Transformer encoder to learn local and global semantic features of smart contracts. We evaluate SRCL on a dataset of 75,006 smart contracts collected from Etherscan. Experimental results show that SRCL considerably outperforms the state-of-the-art code representation models on three downstream tasks.},

abstract = {The ongoing public interest in blockchains and smart contracts has brought a rise to a magnitude of different blockchain implementations. The rate at which new concepts are envisioned and implemented makes it hard to vet their impact on security. Especially smart contract platforms, executing untrusted code, are very complex by design. Still, people put their trust and money into chains that may lack proper testing. A behavior deviation for edge cases of single op-codes is a critical bug class in this brave new world. It can be abused for Denial of Service against the blockchain, chain splits, double-spending, or direct attacks on applications operating on the blockchain. In this paper, we propose an automated methodology to uncover such differences. Through coverage-guided and state-guided fuzzing, we explore smart contract virtual machine behavior against multiple VMs in parallel. We develop NeoDiff, the first framework for feedback-guided differential fuzzing of smart contract VMs. We discuss real, monetary consequences our tool prevents. NeoDiff can be ported to new smart contract platforms with ease. Apart from fuzzing Ethereum VMs, NeoDiff found a range of critical differentials in VMs for the Neo blockchain. Moreover, through a higher-layer semantics mutator, we uncovered semantic discrepancies between Neo smart contracts written in Python when executed on the blockchain vs. classic CPython. Along the way, NeoDiff uncovered memory corruptions in the C# Neo VM.},

Blockchain technology is strictly related to the exchange of sensitive information, and its massive adoption is corresponding to interest from attackers. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically detect whether a Smart Contract (i.e. a contract between two parties concerning the exchange of goods and services, it is executed automatically and is governed by a source code written by a developer, contains clearly conditions accepted by both parties and resides on a distributed and decentralised network of computers) exhibits vulnerability. The proposed method relies on model checking and, through the adoption of μ-Calculus rules, is aimed to detect four different vulnerabilities on Smart Contracts modeled as automata. We preliminary evaluate the proposed method on a dataset composed by 40 (vulnerable and legitimate) contracts, by obtaining a precision ranging from 0.98 to 1 and a recall equal to 1, confirming that the proposed method can be promising in vulnerable Smart Contract detection.},

abstract = {Abstract - Smart contracts are essentially agreements between two parties, and the information included within them must be kept private and not shared with the outside community. Simultaneously, the most typical smart contract systems’ public nature limits the meaning of contracts. Smart contract confidentiality problems are a major impediment to their widespread adoption. A viable technique to protecting sensitive information is to hide it with cryptographic primitives or a hashing algorithm, however, hashing is irreversible, thus to address these issues, we first observed the privacy leakage of public smart contracts in this study. We next introduced our technique for privacy-preserving smart contracts, which includes encrypted user output values and defines holders of private values to prevent unintentional data leakage.},

abstract = {The Blockchain 2.0 era integrated with smart contract along with its platforms and applications have experienced explosive growth in recent years. However, many smart contracts deployed in practice are prone to errors and cannot be modified due to the immutability of the blockchain. In light of this, it is vital to ensure the security of correctness of smart contracts before deployment. This paper proposes a formal modeling method based on Timed Colored Petri net (TCPN) to anlyze smart contracts with time constrains. We apply this formalism to a concrete voting contract system. Its functional requirements are formalized by the improved computing timing logic ASK-CTL with ML (Meta Language). Simulation and experiment show that the security and reliability of the voting contract can be effectively guaranteed.},

abstract = {The skyrocketing market value of cryptocurrencies has prompted more investors to pour funds into cryptocurrencies to seek asset hedging. However, the anonymity of blockchain makes cryptocurrency naturally a tool of choice for criminals to commit smart contract scams. Consequently, smart contract scam detection is particularly critical for investors to avoid economic loss. Previous methods mainly leverage specific code logic of smart contracts and/or design rules based on abnormal transaction behaviors for scam detection. Although these methods gain success at detecting particular scams, they perform worse when applied to scams with highly similar codes. Besides, well-designed decision rules rely on expert knowledge and tedious data collection steps, which causes poor flexibility. To combat these challenges, we consider the problem of smart contract scam detection via mining topological features of account interaction information that dynamically evolves. We adopt interactive features extracted from dynamic interaction information of accounts and propose a framework named TTG-SCSD to utilize the features and Topological Data Analysis for smart contract scams detection. The TTG-SCSD constructs discrete dynamic interaction graphs for each contract and designs interactive features that characterize account behaviors. The features are modeled combined with a topology quantification mechanism to capture contract intentions in transactions. Experimental results on real-world transaction datasets from Ethereum show that TTG-SCSD obtains better generalizability and improves the performance of the bare versions of the comparison methods.},

Because of this, verification and validation of smart contracts is of vital importance. Indeed, it is industrial practice to hire independent specialized companies to audit smart contracts before deployment. Auditors typically rely on a combination of tools and experience but still fail to identify problems in smart contracts before deployment, causing significant losses. In this paper, we propose using predicate abstraction to construct models which can be used by auditors to explore and validate smart contact behaviour at the function call level by proposing predicates that expose different aspects of the contract. We propose predicates based on requires clauses and enum-type state variables as a starting point for contract validation and report on an evaluation on two different benchmarks.},

abstract = {Over the past couple of years, smart contracts have been plagued by multifarious vulnerabilities, which have led to catastrophic financial losses. Their security issues, therefore, have drawn intense attention. As countermeasures, a family of tools has been developed to identify vulnerabilities in smart contracts at the source-code level. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of smart contracts is currently open-sourced. Another spectrum of work is presented to deal with pure bytecode, but most such efforts still suffer from relatively low performance due to the inherent difficulty in restoring abundant semantics in the source code from the bytecode. This paper proposes a novel cross-modality mutual learning framework for enhancing smart contract vulnerability detection on bytecode. Specifically, we engage in two networks, a student network as the primary network and a teacher network as the auxiliary network. takes two modalities, i.e., source code and its corresponding bytecode as inputs, while is fed with only bytecode. By learning from , is trained to infer the missed source code embeddings and combine both modalities to approach precise vulnerability detection. To further facilitate mutual learning between and , we present a cross-modality mutual learning loss and two transfer losses. As a side contribution, we construct and release a labeled smart contract dataset that concerns four types of common vulnerabilities. Experimental results show that our method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art approaches.},

Unfortunately, as reported, existing symbolic tools cost too much time, since they need to execute all paths to detect vulnerabilities. Thus, their accuracy is limited by time. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose Park, the first general framework of parallel-fork symbolic execution for smart contracts. The main idea is to use multiple processes during symbolic execution, leveraging multiple CPU cores to enhance efficiency. Firstly, we propose a fork-operation based dynamic forking algorithm to achieve parallel symbolic contract execution. Secondly, to address the SMT performance loss problem in parallelization, we propose an adaptive processes restriction and adjustment algorithm. Thirdly, we design a shared-memory based global variable reconstruction method to collect and rebuild the global variables from different processes. We implement Park as a plug-in and apply it to two popular symbolic execution tools for smart contracts: Oyente and Mythril. The experimental results with third-party datasets show that Park-Oyente and Park-Mythril can provide up to 6.84x and 7.06x speedup compared to original tools, respectively.},

It is highly desired to ensure the quality of smart contract source code before they are deployed. This paper proposes a new deep learning-based tool, MANDO-GURU, that aims to accurately detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts at both coarse-grained contract-level and fine-grained line-level. Using a combination of control-flow graphs and call graphs of Solidity code, we design new heterogeneous graph attention neural networks to encode more structural and potentially semantic relations among different types of nodes and edges of such graphs and use the encoded embeddings of the graphs and nodes to detect vulnerabilities. Our validation of real-world smart contract datasets shows that MANDO-GURU can significantly improve many other vulnerability detection techniques by up to 24% in terms of the F1-score at the contract level, depending on vulnerability types. It is the first learning-based tool for Ethereum smart contracts that identify vulnerabilities at the line level and significantly improves the traditional code analysis-based techniques by up to 63.4%. Our tool is publicly available at https://github.com/MANDO-Project/ge-sc-machine.

abstract = {Blockchain technology is becoming increasingly popular, and smart contracts (i.e., programs that run on top of the blockchain) represent a crucial element of this technology. In particular, smart contracts running on Ethereum (i.e., one of the most popular blockchain platforms) are often developed with Solidity, and their deployment and execution consume gas (i.e., a fee compensating the computing resources required). Smart contract development frequently involves code reuse, but poor readable smart contracts could hinder their reuse. However, writing readable smart contracts is challenging, since practices for improving the readability could also be in contrast with optimization strategies for reducing gas consumption. This paper aims at better understanding (i) the readability aspects for which traditional software and smart contracts differ, and (ii) the specific smart contract readability features exhibiting significant relationships with gas consumption. We leverage a set of metrics that previous research has proven correlated with code readability. In particular, we first compare the values of these metrics obtained for both Solidity smart contracts and traditional software systems (written in Java). Then, we investigate the correlations occurring between these metrics and gas consumption and between each pair of metrics. The results of our study highlight that smart contracts usually exhibit lower readability than traditional software for what concerns the number of parentheses, inline comments, and blank lines used. In addition, we found some readability metrics (such as the average length of identifiers and the average number of keywords) that significantly correlate with gas consumption.},

In this context, optimizing gas fees in smart contracts becomes necessary to save costs for both developers and users who interact directly with these contracts. To optimize gas, developers typically need to have deep knowledge of blockchain and programming languages, making it a significant challenge for new programmers. In this paper, we introduce GasSaver - an open-source tool that analyzes Solidity-based contracts and suggests modifications to reduce transaction fees. Our tool, which relies on a set of seven rules for identifying non-optimized codes, shows that 6,333 in a total of 10,245 top most interactive contracts on Ethereum contain at least one optimization problem and the total problems are more than 30,000. Hence, the use of this tool can reduce a considerable cost for the deployment and interaction of smart contracts.},

abstract = {Unlike traditional software, smart contracts have the unique organization in which a sequence of transactions shares persistent states. Unfortunately, such a characteristic makes it difficult for existing fuzzers to find out critical transaction sequences. To tackle this challenge, we employ both static and dynamic analyses for fuzzing smart contracts. First, we statically analyze smart contract bytecodes to predict which transaction sequences will lead to effective testing, and figure out if there is a certain constraint that each transaction should satisfy. Such information is then passed to the fuzzing phase and used to construct an initial seed corpus. During a fuzzing campaign, we perform a lightweight dynamic data-flow analysis to collect data-flow-based feedback to effectively guide fuzzing. We implement our ideas on a practical open-source fuzzer, named Smartian. Smartian can discover bugs in real-world smart contracts without the need for the source code. Our experimental results show that Smartian is more effective than existing state-of-the-art tools in finding known CVEs from real-world contracts. Smartian also outperforms other tools in terms of code coverage.},

abstract = {Copyright protection in multimedia protection distribution is a challenging problem. To protect multimedia data, many watermarking methods have been proposed in the literature. However, most of them cannot be used effectively in a multimedia distribution network (MDN) as they are not designed to support multi-layer watermark embedding. Multi-layer watermarking mechanisms were developed to protect multimedia data across different layers in an MDN. However, in those mechanisms, we need to trust the entities in the MDN, such as regional and country distributors. To overcome this potential drawback, in this article, we propose a novel privacy protection mechanism for MDNs by combining the advantages of both blockchain and watermarking technologies. A specifically designed watermarking algorithm is used to link the copyright information with the audio file, while a novel blockchain-based smart contract mechanism is developed to enforce the proper functioning of each entity in the distribution network. Moreover, the new audio mechanism is computationally efficient. Although audio signals are used to show the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism, the proposed approach can easily be extended to other multimedia objects, such as an image. The validity of the proposed mechanism is demonstrated by our simulation results. The proposed mechanism can benefit multimedia production companies and other entities in the MDN.},

abstract = {Tokens have become an essential part of blockchain ecosystem, so recognizing token transfer behaviors is crucial for applications depending on blockchain. Unfortunately, existing solutions cannot recognize token transfer behaviors accurately and efficiently because of their incomplete patterns and inefficient designs. This work proposes TokenAware, a novel online system for recognizing token transfer behaviors. To improve accuracy, TokenAware infers token transfer behaviors from modifications of internal bookkeeping of a token smart contract for recording the information of token holders (e.g., their addresses and shares). However, recognizing bookkeeping is challenging, because smart contract bytecode does not contain type information. TokenAware overcomes the challenge by first learning the instruction sequences for locating basic types and then deriving the instruction sequences for locating sophisticated types that are composed of basic types. To improve efficiency, TokenAware introduces four optimizations. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate TokenAware with real blockchain data. Results show that TokenAware can automatically identify new types of bookkeeping and recognize 107,202 tokens with 98.7% precision. TokenAware with optimizations merely incurs 4% overhead, which is 1/345 of the overhead led by the counterpart with no optimization. Moreover, we develop an application based on TokenAware to demonstrate how it facilitates malicious behavior detection.},

abstract = {Smart contracts have been widely and rapidly used to automate financial and business transactions together with blockchains, helping people make agreements while minimizing trusts. With millions of smart contracts deployed on blockchain, various bugs and vulnerabilities in smart contracts have emerged. Following the rapid development of deep learning, many recent studies have used deep learning for vulnerability detection to conduct security checks before deploying smart contracts. These approaches show effective results on detecting whether a smart contract is vulnerable or not whereas their results on locating suspicious statements responsible for the detected vulnerability are still unsatisfactory. To address this problem, we propose a deep learning based two-phase smart contract debugger for reentrancy vulnerability, one of the most severe vulnerabilities, named as ReVulDL: Reentrancy Vulnerability Detection and Localization. ReVulDL integrates the vulnerability detection and localization into a unified debugging pipeline. For the detection phase, given a smart contract, ReVulDL uses a graph-based pre-training model to learn the complex relationships in propagation chains for detecting whether the smart contract contains a reentrancy vulnerability. For the localization phase, if a reentrancy vulnerability is detected, ReVulDL utilizes interpretable machine learning to locate the suspicious statements in smart contract to provide interpretations of the detected vulnerability. Our large-scale empirical study on 47,398 smart contracts shows that ReVulDL achieves promising results in detecting reentrancy vulnerabilities (e.g., outperforming 16 state-of-the-art vulnerability detection approaches) and locating vulnerable statements (e.g., 70.38% of the vulnerable statements are ranked within Top-10).},

abstract = {Programming errors enable security attacks on smart contracts, which are used to manage large sums of financial assets. Automated program repair (APR) techniques aim to reduce developers’ burden of manually fixing bugs by automatically generating patches for a given issue. Existing APR tools for smart contracts focus on mitigating typical smart contract vulnerabilities rather than violations of functional specification. However, in decentralized financial (DeFi) smart contracts, the inconsistency between intended behavior and implementation translates into the deviation from the underlying financial model, resulting in monetary losses for the application and its users. In this work, we propose DeFinery—a technique for automated repair of a smart contract that does not satisfy a user-defined correctness property. To explore a larger set of diverse patches while providing formal correctness guarantees w.r.t. the intended behavior, we combine search-based patch generation with semantic analysis of an original program for inferring its specification. Our experiments in repairing 9 real-world and benchmark smart contracts prove that DeFinery efficiently generates high-quality patches that cannot be found by other existing tools.},

abstract = {With the development of decentralized networks, smart contracts, especially those for ERC tokens, are attracting more and more Dapp users to implement their applications. There are some functions in ERC token contracts that only a specific group of accounts could invoke. Among those functions, some even can influence other accounts or the whole system without prior notice or permission. These functions are referred to as contract backdoors. Once exploited by an attacker, they can cause property losses and harm users’ privacy.In this work, we propose Pied-Piper, a hybrid analysis method that integrates datalog analysis and directed fuzzing to detect backdoor threats in Ethereum ERC token contracts. First, datalog analysis is applied to abstract the data structures and identification rules related to the threats for preliminary static detection. Then, directed fuzzing is applied to eliminate false positives caused by the static analysis. We first evaluated Pied-Piper on 200 smart contracts, which are injected with different types of backdoors. It reported all problems without false positives, and none of the injected problems was missed. Then, we applied Pied-Piper on 13,484 real token contracts deployed on Ethereum. Pied-Piper reported 189 confirmed problems, four of which have been assigned unique CVE ids while others are still in the review process. Each contract takes 8.03 seconds for datalog analysis on average, and the fuzzing engine can eliminate the false positives within one minute.},

abstract = {Smart contracts deployed on permissionless blockchains, such as Ethereum, are accessible to any user in a trustless environment. Therefore, most smart contract applications implement access control policies to protect their valuable assets from unauthorized accesses. A difficulty in validating the conformance to such policies, i.e., whether the contract implementation adheres to the expected behaviors, is the lack of policy specifications. In this paper, we mine past transactions of a contract to recover a likely access control model, which can then be checked against various information flow policies and identify potential bugs related to user permissions. We implement our role mining and security policy validation in tool SPCon. The experimental evaluation on labeled smart contract role mining benchmark demonstrates that SPCon effectively mines more accurate user roles compared to the state-of-the-art role mining tools. Moreover, the experimental evaluation on real-world smart contract benchmark and access control CVEs indicates SPCon effectively detects potential permission bugs while having better scalability and lower false-positive rate compared to the state-of-the-art security tools, finding 11 previously unknown bugs and detecting six CVEs that no other tool can find.},

abstract = {Smart contracts are programs stored on blockchains to execute transactions. When input constraints or security properties are violated at runtime, the transaction being executed by a smart contract needs to be reverted to avoid undesirable consequences. On Ethereum, the most popular blockchain that supports smart contracts, developers can choose among three transaction-reverting statements (i.e., require, if...revert, and if...throw) to handle anomalous transactions. While these transaction-reverting statements are vital for preventing smart contracts from exhibiting abnormal behaviors or suffering malicious attacks, there is limited understanding of how they are used in practice. In this work, we perform the first empirical study to characterize transaction-reverting statements in Ethereum smart contracts. We measured the prevalence of these statements in 3,866 verified smart contracts from popular dapps and built a taxonomy of their purposes via manually analyzing 557 transaction-reverting statements. We also compared template contracts and their corresponding custom contracts to understand how developers customize the use of transaction-reverting statements. Finally, we analyzed the security impact of transaction-reverting statements by removing them from smart contracts and comparing the mutated contracts against the original ones. Our study led to important findings. For example, we found that transaction-reverting statements are commonly used to perform seven types of authority verifications or validity checks, and missing such statements may compromise the security of smart contracts. We also found that current smart contract security analyzers cannot effectively handle transaction-reverting statements when detecting security vulnerabilities. Our findings can shed light on further research in the broad area of smart contract quality assurance and provide practical guidance to smart contract developers on the appropriate use of transaction-reverting statements.},

abstract = {With the increasing popularity of blockchain, automatically detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts is becoming a significant problem. Prior research mainly identifies smart contract vulnerabilities without considering the interactions between multiple contracts. Due to the lack of analyzing the fine-grained contextual information during cross-contract invocations, existing approaches often produced a large number of false positives and false negatives. This paper proposes SmartDagger, a new framework for detecting cross-contract vulnerability through static analysis at the bytecode level. SmartDagger integrates a set of novel mechanisms to ensure its effectiveness and efficiency for cross-contract vulnerability detection. Particularly, SmartDagger effectively recovers the contract attribute information from the smart contract bytecode, which is critical for accurately identifying cross-contract vulnerabilities. Besides, instead of performing the typical whole-program analysis which is heavy-weight and time-consuming, SmartDagger selectively analyzes a subset of functions and reuses the data-flow results, which helps to improve its efficiency. Our further evaluation over a manually labelled dataset showed that SmartDagger significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art tools (i.e., Oyente, Slither, Osiris, and Mythril) for detecting cross-contract vulnerabilities. In addition, running SmartDagger over a randomly selected dataset of 250 smart contracts in the real-world, SmartDagger detects 11 cross-contract vulnerabilities, all of which are missed by prior tools.},

abstract = {Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are becoming a standard to represent unique and valuable items, such as a piece of art, a videogame item, or other digital or physical goods, and keep track of their provenance. Thanks to blockchain technology and the power of smart contracts, NFT holders have true ownership over them, because they are the only ones who can transfer them. However, through an attack called sleepminting, an attacker is able to impersonate another person, including an artist, and create NFTs on the artist’s behalf, while still maintaining its possession, leveraging bugs in the code of the smart contract that manages the NFTs. Therefore, the attacker can cheat concerning the provenance of an NFT and then sell the fake NFTs to unaware buyers. In this paper, we propose a study that sheds light on this phenomenon. In particular, we collect over 1.3 million events that are connected to sleepminting and analyse the events under multiple aspects. The study uncovers that, by using the sleepminting attack, some users are able to create fake NFTs of popular brands, and are able to mint them to famous personalities in the NFT field, such as well known artists and collectors.},

abstract = {Static analysis of smart-contracts is becoming more widespread on blockchain platforms. Analyzers rely on techniques like symbolic execution or model checking, but few of them can provide strong soundness properties and guarantee the analysis termination at the same time. As smart-contracts often manipulate economic assets, proving numerical properties beyond the absence of runtime errors is also desirable. Smart-contract execution models differ considerably from mainstream programming languages and vary from one blockchain to another, making state-of-the-art analyses hard to adapt. For instance, smart-contract calls may modify a persistent storage impacting subsequent calls. This makes it difficult for tools to infer invariants %and high-level security properties required to formally ensure the absence of exploitable vulnerabilities. The Michelson smart-contract language, used in the Tezos blockchain, is strongly typed, stack-based, and has a strict execution model leaving few opportunities for implicit runtime errors. We present a work in progress static analyzer for Michelson based on Abstract Interpretation and implemented within MOPSA, a modular static analyzer. Our tool supports the Michelson semantic features, including inner calls to external contracts. It can prove the absence of runtime errors and infer invariants on the persistent storage over an unbounded number of calls. It is also being extended to prove high-level numerical and security properties.},

abstract = {Despite the benefits that the Blockchain technology brings to many application fields, its adoption does not come without challenges. Smart contracts, which are at the core of 2nd generation blockchains, can often be riddled with vulnerabilities that can be exploited to attack the platform and threaten its security. It is therefore crucial for the protection of the designed systems to prove the correctness of the smart contracts to be deployed. Approaches have been proposed to detect generic vulnerabilities like reentrancy, but the results would often include false positives where the detected bug is either non existent or not exploitable. Besides, such approaches do not offer to check contract-specific properties. The work presented in this paper is situated as part of a formal approach that we have proposed in an attempt to bridge this gap. This previously outlined approach is based on the transformation of Solidity smart contracts into Coloured Petri nets, which provides the possibility to verify smart contracts with reference to properties expressed as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulae. Herein we extend our previous work on mainly two levels: first, by taking into account the concept of function calls in the transformation and second, by focusing on the LTL properties that can define the correctness of a smart contract. Such properties can be specific to the control- or data-flow of the contracts being checked. They can also be used to express vulnerabilities as we showcase by proposing LTL formalizations for six vulnerabilities from the literature. We then leverage the capability of the Helena model checker to detect these vulnerabilities while discerning their exploitability, as well as check temporal-based contract-specific properties.},

Thus, it is crucial and urgent to detect the vulnerabilities of smart contracts. However, existing fuzzers for smart contracts are still inefficient to detect sophisticated vulnerabilities that require specific vulnerable transaction sequences to trigger. To address this challenge, we propose a novel vulnerability-guided fuzzer based on reinforcement learning, namely RLF, for generating vulnerable transaction sequences to detect such sophisticated vulnerabilities in smart contracts. In particular, we firstly model the process of fuzzing smart contracts as a Markov decision process to construct our reinforcement learning framework. We then creatively design an appropriate reward with consideration of both vulnerability and code coverage so that it can effectively guide our fuzzer to generate specific transaction sequences to reveal vulnerabilities, especially for the vulnerabilities related to multiple functions. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate RLF’s performance. The experimental results demonstrate that our RLF outperforms state-of-the-art vulnerability-detection tools (e.g., detecting 8%-69% more vulnerabilities within 30 minutes).},

To deal with the vulnerabilities, security auditing has been emerging and widely adopted for manual code inspection. However, little is known about how manual security auditing impacts the blockchain community. In this work, we investigated security audits on blockchain by answering three research questions covering the type, severity, and resolve status of issues in the audit reports. We in total collected 2,421 security audit reports consisting of the details of 28,782 security issues. We found that manual security auditing has superior merit over static analysis tools in identifying logic-related issues, considering 27.65% of all findings are logical issues. We also found that 87.28% of 2,421 projects have at least one centralization issue that breaks the decentralization primitive of blockchain. Moreover, while 21.17% of issues are of major or critical severity, we surprisingly found that 61.83% of all issues were unresolved or partially resolved. We concluded that while manual security auditing can help identify security vulnerabilities uniquely, project developers need to take serious actions to address and secure their smart contracts.},

We propose a system which implements Ethereum for the blockchain and React web application for the interface of the system. Data management and the access control are provided through Ethereum smart contracts, and the access control requires different role-based permission to upload and access the patients’ data. The system works successfully with average time taken to verify the role is 1.8033 seconds per session. The privacy of the patients’ data is ensured because only the patients that are allowed to keep the ID of their own data.},

The recent emergence of blockchain with IoT provides significant growth in the healthcare industry to improve security, privacy, efficiency, and transparency with more business opportunities. Nevertheless, conventional healthcare schemes suffer from various security attacks like collusion, phishing, masquerade, etc. Therefore, a privacy-preserving Distributed Application (DA) is proposed in this paper using blockchain technology to create and maintain healthcare certificates. Here, the distributed application provides an interface between the blockchain network and system objects like healthcare centers, verifiers, and regular authorities to generate and issue medical documents. In addition, it also ensures security by specifying rules using various smart contracts. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, various experimental tests are conducted using the Etherscan tool for measuring operation cost, latency, and processing time. Here, the efficiency of the proposed system is also compared to the existing systems in terms of latency, throughput, and response time. The experimental results and comparative analysis show that the proposed work is more efficient than the existing techniques.},

abstract = {At present, using a large number of unsafe IoT devices to form botnets and launching DDoS attacks have become one of the main threats to IoT security. However, most of the existing DDoS attack defense methods are limited to being implemented within a single controller management network domain. In fact, many IoT devices that attackers build botnets are usually located in the jurisdiction of different controllers. Therefore, a mechanism is needed for each domain to cooperate with each other and share information about the attack source, so as to realize the defense against DDoS attacks across multiple domains. Blockchain technology's decentralization and group trusted collaboration mechanism provide a new method for solving cross-domain DDoS attack defense. This article combines SDN and blockchain with IoT, and proposes a cross-domain collaborative DDoS defense scheme based on blockchain and SDN architecture. It allows multiple SDN-based domains to collaborate with each other and share attack source information in a decentralized manner, making collaborative DDoS attack defense across multiple domains more flexible. Experimental results show that the defense mechanism has flexibility, feasibility, and safety.},

abstract = {The development of the Internet has revolutionized the news industry. While bringing various advantages, it has also caused an overflow of fake and malicious news, which has damaged social and economic benefits. In recent years, new news detection schemes are constantly proposed. In the scheme based on artificial detection, blockchain has become an important infrastructure and tool. Because blockchain is open, transparent, tamper-resistant, and traceable, it has important use value in the scenario of artificial detection, which requires the consensus of multiple entities. However, most of the current blockchain-based solutions focus on ex-ante detection, and they do not implement fine-grained detection division. Obviously, one validator cannot detect the authenticity of all types of news, which leads to a reduction in the credibility of the detection results. In this paper, we propose a framework for news full lifecycle management. First, the news is matched with the professional validators through a fine-grained detection control strategy. Then, based on sealed bid auction and secret sharing technology, a Six-stage Submission Protocol is proposed, which places the validator's consensus process off-chain, saving transaction costs and ensuring the credibility of the detection results. We analyzed the cost and performance of the proposed framework, and the results proved its correctness and feasibility.},

abstract = {Ponzi schemes are financial scams that lure users under the promise of high profits. With the prosperity of Bitcoin and blockchain technologies, there has been growing anecdotal evidence that this classic fraud has emerged in the blockchain ecosystem. Existing studies have proposed machine-learning based approaches for detecting Ponzi schemes. However, these state-of-the-art approaches face several major limitations, including lacking interpretability, high false positive rates and the weak robustness to evasion techniques, These limitations mean that existing real-world methods for detecting Ponzi schemes are ineffective.In this paper, we propose SADPonzi, a semantic-aware detection approach for identifying Ponzi schemes in Ethereum smart contracts. Specifically, we propose a heuristic-guided symbolic execution technique to identify investor-related transfer behaviors and the distribution strategies adopted. Experimental result on a well-labelled benchmark suggests that SADPonzi can achieve 100% precision and recall, outperforming all existing machine-learning based techniques. We further apply SADPonzi to all 3.4 million smart contracts deployed by EOAs in Ethereum and identify 835 Ponzi scheme contracts, with over 17 million US Dollars invested by victims. Our observations confirm the urgency of identifying and mitigating Ponzi schemes in the blockchain ecosystem.},

However, the testing technology of Hyperledger Fabric smart contracts (also known as chaincode) is not yet mature currently. Based on this, this paper studies the vulnerability detection of Golang chaincodes. Firstly, we summarize 17 kinds of Golang chaincode vulnerabilities by investigating existing research. Secondly, taking the high accuracy of dynamic detection and the high efficiency of static detection into consideration, we propose a chaincode vulnerability detection framework that combines the dynamic symbolic execution and the static abstract syntax tree analysis technology. We also implement a supporting-tool that can detect the above 15 types of vulnerabilities. Finally, we test the tool by 15 chaincodes collected from GitHub and unknown vulnerabilities were detected in 13 projects. The precision turned out to be 91% after manual inspection. In order to verify the recall rate, we manually inject 30 vulnerabilities into the collected chaincodes and all of them are detected. The evaluation results show the accuracy of the proposed vulnerability detection method for Hyperledger Fabric smart contracts.},

The more gas used indicates a higher transaction fee. In my doctoral research, we aim to investigate two widely studied issues regarding gas, i.e., gas estimation and gas optimization. The former is to predict gas costs for executing a transactions to avoid out-of-gas exceptions, and the latter is to modify existing contracts to save transaction fee. We target some problems that previous work did not solve: gas estimation for loop functions, and gas optimization for storage usage and arrays. We expect that my research can help Ethereum users avoid economical loss for out-of-gas exceptions and pay less transaction fee.},

abstract = {Healthcare systems based on the Internet of Things have an increasing demand for health sensing technology. To manage the data collected and sampled by medical devices, traditional centralized data management will lead to attacks such as single point of failure, which pose a security threat. Aiming at the problems of low data trust and uncontrolled data sharing in telemedicine, we proposed blockchain-based secure medical data management and disease prediction. To securely manage healthcare data, we carefully designed three-tier architecture. Specifically, in the user sensor layer, medical sensors monitor the patient status in real-time. In the storage layer, to protect the privacy of patients, we stored their data in blocks and quantified the medical data by using information entropy technology. In addition, in the blockchain layer, we also used smart contracts for application, authorization, and access control of health data to eliminate privacy leaks caused by internal and external security risks. The information summary is recorded on the blockchain to ensure the integrity of backtracking and anti-repudiation. We designed an extensible machine learning algorithm to predict disease types using a disease prediction model algorithm based on transfer learning. Security analysis and numerical results showed that the proposed scheme can effectively manage the safety data of telemedicine and predict the patient's future condition.},

abstract = {The blockchain technology has been gaining an increasing popularity for the last years, and smart contracts are being used for a growing number of applications in several scenarios. The execution of smart contracts on public blockchains can be invoked by any user with a transaction, although in many scenarios there would be the need for restricting the right of executing smart contracts only to a restricted set of users. To help deal with this issue, this article proposes a system based on a popular access control framework called RT, Role-based Trust Management, to regulate smart contracts execution rights. The proposed system, called Layer 2 DecentrAlized Role-based Trust management (L2DART), implements the RT framework on a public blockchain, and it is designed as a layer-2 technology that involves both on-chain and off-chain functionalities to reduce the blockchain costs while keeping blockchain auditability, i.e., immutability and transparency. The on-chain costs of L2DART have been evaluated on Ethereum and compared with a previous solution implementing on-chain all the functionalities. The results show that the on-chain costs of L2DART are relatively low, making the system deployable in real-world scenarios.},

abstract = {Fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks are now operational to deploy all over the world. The technology of 5G’s objective is to link heterogeneous machines and devices with significant improvements high quality of service (QoS), internet bandwidth, and improved system throughput to enable several upright applications. Despite all these benefits that 5G will provide, still, significant issues need to be resolved, such as decentralization, transparency, and risks associated with data interoperability, network privacy, and security vulnerabilities. Modern networks link an enormous number of devices to the Internet, and in this complicated situation, the use of BC and SDN has been effectively advocated to assure security, privacy, and secrecy. This study offers a blockchain-enabled SDN framework for securing transactions that makes use of Software Defined Network (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) to overcome these issues. The proposed framework can address the man-in-the-middle attack between control and data plane in SDN networks. A controller authentication scheme is provided using smart contracts. Smart contracts automatically authenticate the SDN controller to increase the efficiency of controller verification. The communicated data can also be authenticated using smart contracts. The proposed framework can enhance network transparency, data security, and user privacy. Each SDN controller can access verifiable data using the proposed framework.},

abstract = {Federated Learning (FL) presents a privacy-compliant approach by sharing model parameters instead of raw data. However, how to motivate data owners to participate in and stay within an FL ecosystem by continuously contributing their data to the FL model remains a challenge. In this article, we propose a hybrid incentive mechanism based on blockchain to address the above challenge. The proposed mechanism comprises two primary smart contract-based modules, namely the reputation module and the reverse auction module. The former is used to dynamically calculate the reputation score of each FL participant. It employs a trust-jointed reputation scheme to balance the weights between trust values of parameters and bid prices. The latter is responsible for initiating FL auction tasks, calculating price rankings, and assigning corresponding token rewards. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the feasibility and performance of the proposed mechanism against the three typical threats. Experimental results indicate that our mechanism can successfully reduce incentive costs while preventing participants from colluding and over-bidding in the data sharing auction.},

abstract = {Blockchain has introduced new opportunities with the potential to enhance systems and services across diverse application domains. Fundamental characteristics of blockchains such as immutability, decentralisation, transparency and traceability have a profound role in this. However, integration with contemporary systems and among disparate blockchain-based applications is a non-trivial challenge primarily due to differences with respect to platforms, consensus mechanism, and governance. Although this challenge has received some attention from the research community, it requires careful analysis to analyse existing work and ascertain gaps to achieve effective and efficient solution to this challenge. This article presents a thorough systematic review of existing research within blockchain interoperability highlighting significant contributions. Leveraging this analysis, the article presents an internet-inspired framework (Chain-Net) to facilitate interoperability within blockchain-based systems whereby two systems within independent Blockchain networks can securely exchange data with each other. This is achieved by using gateway module at each network. This module is a lightweight node registered by the Blockchain network, equipped with discovery service to lookup a target blockchain, and is responsible for forwarding cross-chain transactions to gateway module at the target blockchain. Gateway module plays a vital role in the Chain-Net model, as it holds a cross-chain transaction in a pending state until a confirmation is received from the target blockchain, thus maintaining the record integrity between the two chains. The article presents our efforts to evaluate the proposed blockchain interoperability framework against success criteria based on our analysis of the blockchain interoperability challenge.},

abstract = {This paper presents DeCon, a declarative programming language for implementing smart contracts and specifying contract-level properties. Driven by the observation that smart contract operations and contract-level properties can be naturally expressed as relational constraints, DeCon models each smart contract as a set of relational tables that store transaction records. This relational representation of smart contracts enables convenient specification of contract properties, facilitates run-time monitoring of potential property violations, and brings clarity to contract debugging via data provenance. Specifically, a DeCon program consists of a set of declarative rules and violation query rules over the relational representation, describing the smart contract implementation and contract-level properties, respectively. We have developed a tool that can compile DeCon programs into executable Solidity programs, with instrumentation for run-time property monitoring. Our case studies demonstrate that DeCon can implement realistic smart contracts such as ERC20 and ERC721 digital tokens. Our evaluation results reveal the marginal overhead of DeCon compared to the open-source reference implementation, incurring 14% median gas overhead for execution, and another 16% median gas overhead for run-time verification.},

abstract = {The blockchain technology, initially created for cryptocurrency, has been re-purposed for recording state transitions of smart contracts — decentralized applications that can be invoked through external transactions. Smart contracts gained popularity and accrued hundreds of billions of dollars in market capitalization in recent years. Unfortunately, like all other computer programs, smart contracts are prone to security vulnerabilities that have incurred multibillion-dollar damages over the past decade. As a result, many automated threat mitigation solutions have been proposed to counter the security issues of smart contracts. These threat mitigation solutions include various tools and methods that are challenging to compare. This survey develops a comprehensive classification taxonomy of smart contract threat mitigation solutions within five orthogonal dimensions: defense modality, core method, targeted contracts, input-output data mapping, and threat model. We classify 133 existing threat mitigation solutions using our taxonomy and confirm that the proposed five dimensions allow us to concisely and accurately describe any smart contract threat mitigation solution. In addition to learning what the threat mitigation solutions do, we also show how these solutions work by synthesizing their actual designs into a set of uniform workflows corresponding to the eight existing defense core methods. We further create an integrated coverage map for the known smart contract vulnerabilities by the existing threat mitigation solutions. Finally, we perform the evidence-based evolutionary analysis, in which we identify trends and future perspectives of threat mitigation in smart contracts and pinpoint major weaknesses of the existing methodologies. For the convenience of smart contract security developers, auditors, users, and researchers, we deploy and maintain a regularly updated comprehensive open-source online registry of threat mitigation solutions, called Security Threat Mitigation (STM) Registry at https://seit.egr.msu.edu/research/stmregistry/.},

To enable developers discover vulnerabilities in smart contracts, several static analysis tools have been proposed. However, despite the numerous bug-finding tools, security vulnerabilities abound in smart contracts, and developers rely on finding vulnerabilities manually. Our goal in this dissertation study is to expand the space of security vulnerabilities detection by proposing effective static analysis approaches for smart contracts. We study the effectiveness of the existing static analysis tools and propose solutions for security vulnerabilities detection relying on analyzing the dependency of the contract code on user inputs that lead to security vulnerabilities. Our results of evaluating static analysis tools show that existing static tools for smart contracts have significant false-negatives and false-positives. Further, the results show that our first vulnerability detection approach achieves a significant improvement in the effectiveness of detecting vulnerabilities compared to the prior work.},

abstract = {Now a days, people spend most of their times in social media. Due to availability of news and also for the free scope of sharing, most of the time rumors are being extensive in a short period of time. Detecting and preventing rumors and false information remains a significant challenge for social network. The introduction of blockchain technology has paved the way for the development of decentralized apps in order to address this issue. In this technology any information is recorded permanently. We will explore a strategy to eliminate bogus news on social media by utilizing the benefits of peer-to-peer network ideas. By issuing non-fungible token content rating we can detect and ensure appropriate news. The findings revealed that the suggested technique has a satisfactory performance and efficiency in recognizing rumors and preventing their spread.},

abstract = {Ethereum has been attracting lots of attacks, hence there is a pressing need to perform timely investigation and detect more attack instances. However, existing systems suffer from the scalability issue due to the following reasons. First, the tight coupling between malicious contract detection and blockchain data importing makes them infeasible to repeatedly detect different attacks. Second, the coarse-grained archive data makes them inefficient to replay transactions. Third, the separation between malicious contract detection and runtime state recovery consumes lots of storage.In this article, we propose a scalable attack detection framework named EthScope, which overcomes the scalability issue by neatly re-organizing the Ethereum state and efficiently locating suspicious transactions. It leverages the fine-grained state to support the replay of arbitrary transactions and proposes a well-designed schema to optimize the storage consumption. The performance evaluation shows that EthScope can solve the scalability issue, i.e., efficiently performing a large-scale analysis on billions of transactions, and a speedup of around ( text{2,300}times ) when replaying transactions. It also has lower storage consumption compared with existing systems. Further analysis shows that EthScope can help analysts understand attack behaviors and detect more attack instances.},

abstract = {Smart contracts are programs deployed on a blockchain. They are executed for a monetary fee paid in gas—a clear optimization target for smart contract compilers. Because smart contracts are a young, fast-moving field without (manually) fine-tuned compilers, they highly benefit from automated and adaptable approaches, especially as smart contracts are effectively immutable, and as such need a high level of assurance. This makes them an ideal domain for applying formal methods. Super-optimization is a technique to find the best translation of a block of instructions by trying all possible sequences of instructions that produce the same result. We present a framework for super-optimizing smart contracts based on Max-SMT with two main ingredients: (1) a stack functional specification extracted from the basic blocks of a smart contract, which is simplified using rules capturing the semantics of arithmetic, bit-wise, and relational operations, and (2) the synthesis of optimized blocks, which finds—by means of an efficient SMT encoding—basic blocks with minimal gas cost whose stack functional specification is equal (modulo commutativity) to the extracted one.We implemented our framework in the tool syrup&nbsp;2.0. Through large-scale experiments on real-world smart contracts, we analyze performance improvements for different SMT encodings, as well as tradeoffs between quality of optimizations and required optimization time.},

abstract = {Smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain greatly benefit from cutting-edge analysis techniques and pose significant challenges. A primary challenge is the extremely low-level representation of deployed contracts. We present Elipmoc, a decompiler for the next generation of smart contract analyses. Elipmoc is an evolution of Gigahorse, the top research decompiler, dramatically improving over it and over other state-of-the-art tools, by employing several high-precision techniques and making them scalable. Among these techniques are a new kind of context sensitivity (termed “transactional sensitivity”) that provides a more effective static abstraction of distinct dynamic executions; a path-sensitive (yet scalable, through path merging) algorithm for inference of function arguments and returns; and a fully context sensitive private function reconstruction process. As a result, smart contract security analyses and reverse-engineering tools built on top of Elipmoc achieve high scalability, precision and completeness. Elipmoc improves over all notable past decompilers, including its predecessor, Gigahorse, and the state-of-the-art industrial tool, Panoramix, integrated into the primary Ethereum blockchain explorer, Etherscan. Elipmoc produces decompiled contracts with fully resolved operands at a rate of 99.5% (compared to 62.8% for Gigahorse), and achieves much higher completeness in code decompilation than Panoramix—e.g., up to 67% more coverage of external call statements—while being over 5x faster. Elipmoc has been the enabler for recent (independent) discoveries of several exploitable vulnerabilities on popular protocols, over funds in the many millions of dollars.},

To fill the research gap, we propose PonziLens, a novel visualization approach to help investors achieve early identification of Ponzi schemes by investigating the operation codes of smart contracts. Specifically, we conduct symbolic execution of opcode and extract the control flow for investing and rewarding with critical opcode instructions. Then, an intuitive directed-graph based visualization is proposed to display the investing and rewarding flows and the crucial execution paths, enabling easy identification of Ponzi schemes on Ethereum. Two usage scenarios involving both Ponzi and non-Ponzi schemes demonstrate the effectiveness of PonziLens.},

To fix this issue, we propose Acics, an item data consistency auditing scheme in untrusted cloud services for cloud-aided IIoT systems. Acics presents two variants named S-Acics and L-Acics. S-Acics enables industrial participants to audit item data consistency for each item and circularly play the auditing role. L-Acics further enables industrial participants to audit item data consistency for a sampled subset of items while resisting data selection attack via a new separated storage mechanism. Finally, Acics integrates a fair payment mechanism built on smart contract to incentivize the cloud server to provide consistent item data access service for industrial participants. The experiment results show that our solution can audit item data consistency with reasonable cost.},

abstract = {With the rising popularity of Ethereum, there is also an uptick in the number of smart contract based decentralized applications (DApps). Consequently, Ethereum transaction volume is growing steadily over the last few years, but so are the various types of attacks on it. In Ethereum vulnerable smart contracts are always taken advantage of by adversaries. One of the primary ways of exploiting Ethereum with malicious intent is through frontrunning attacks that take advantage of the waiting time of transactions in the pending pool by adjusting the gas price. Attackers willing to execute such attacks constantly monitor the pending transaction pool and try to frontrun transactions. Mitigating such attacks is a critical step for ensuring secure DApp operations in Ethereum. In this paper, we propose a model-based attack detection and prevention scheme. We extract specific features for each transaction and transform each transaction into a feature vector which is then analyzed by a machine learning model to detect if it is a frontrunning attack transaction or not in real time. Extensive experiments on a large dataset of transactions establish the effectiveness of our approach.},

With parallel execution on the PoH Sealevel runtime (instead of PoW), it achieves 100X-1000X speedups compared to Ethereum in terms of transactions per second. With the new programming model, new constraints (owner, signer, keys, bump seeds) and vulnerabilities (missing checks, overflows, type confusion, etc.) must be carefully verified to ensure the security of Solana smart contracts. This paper proposes VRust, the first automated smart contract vulnerability detection framework for Solana. A key technical novelty is a set of static analysis rules for validating untrustful input accounts that are unique in the Solana programming model. We have developed a total of eight different vulnerability types, and VRust is able to check all of them fully automatically by translating source code into Rust MIR-based inference rules without any code annotations. VRust has been evaluated on over a hundred of Solana projects, and it has revealed 12 previously unknown vulnerabilities, including 3 critical vulnerabilities in the official Solana Programming Library confirmed by core developers.},

abstract = {Inter-domain routing is the cornerstone of the modern Internet, and the security of inter-domain routing is very important to the reliability and security of Internet basic services. However, BGP protocol, as a current standard inter-domain routing protocol, lacks security considerations at the beginning of its design and does not authenticate routing messages. Because the BGP Community attribute is widely used, researchers have found a variety of new routing attacks using the Community attribute. This kind of attack is more covert and flexible, the detection mechanism is difficult to detect its existence, and the current trusted verification scheme can not completely defend against this kind of attack. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a BGP Community attribute authentication scheme based on blockchain. This scheme authenticates the use of BGP Community attributes based on the blockchain smart contract for the first time. Based on the routing source authentication provided by the routing source authentication mechanism, this scheme further puts forward the concept of "the right to know about using". Through the agent authentication mechanism, it can effectively resist a variety of new routing attacks without changing the existing BGP routing protocol.},

abstract = {WebAssembly (Wasm) smart contracts have shown growing popularity across blockchains (e.g., EOSIO) recently. Similar to Ethereum smart contracts, Wasm smart contracts suffer from various attacks exploiting their vulnerabilities. Even worse, few developers released the source code of their Wasm smart contracts for security review, raising the bar for uncovering vulnerable contracts. Although a few approaches have been proposed to detect vulnerable Wasm smart contracts, they have several major limitations, e.g., low code coverage, low accuracy and lack of scalability, unable to produce exploit payloads, etc. To fill the gap, in this paper, we design and develop WASAI, a new concolic fuzzer for uncovering vulnerabilities in Wasm smart contract after tackling several challenging issues. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate WASAI, and the results show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. For example, it achieves 2x code coverage than the baselines and surpasses them in detection accuracy, with an F1-measure of 99.2%. Moreover, WASAI can handle complicated contracts (e.g., contracts with obfuscation and sophisticated verification). Applying WASAI to 991 deployed smart contracts in the wild, we find that over 70% of smart contracts are vulnerable. By the time of this study, over 300 vulnerable contracts have not been patched and are still operating on the EOSIO Mainnet. One fake EOS vulnerability reported to the EOSIO ecosystem was recently assigned a CVE identifier (CVE-2022-27134).},

Healthcare authorities needs to effectively manage the healthcare supply chain processes not just during pandemics like COVID-19, but also in their everyday operations to guarantee best possible services. Product recalls, product supply shortage monitoring, expiry, and counterfeiting are some of the critical healthcare supply chain operations which must be ensured. Our suggested solution combines blockchain technology and distributed storage to increase transparency, improve stakeholder communication, and shorten product procurement timelines while eliminating crucial disparities and faults. We present a generic framework for the healthcare supply chain, equipped with comprehensive algorithms showing various stakeholder interactions. Our system uses the Ethereum network to link all parties, including the healthcare authority, manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer, and healthcare provider. Remix IDE platform was used to develop and test the smart contract codes. As decentralized storage, we have used the combination of InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Hyperledger Fabric. We have also examined a variety of security issues, provided a cost analysis of the various transactions proposed in our solution while making comparison with similar blockchain-based solutions.},

abstract = {Ethereum is one of the most popular platforms for the development of blockchain-powered applications. These applications are known as \DH{}Apps. When engineering \DH{}Apps, developers need to translate requests captured in the front-end of their application into one or more smart contract transactions. Developers need to pay for these transactions and, the more they pay (i.e., the higher the gas price), the faster the transaction is likely to be processed. Developing cost-effective \DH{}Apps is far from trivial, as developers need to optimize the balance between cost (transaction fees) and user experience (transaction processing times). Online services have been developed to provide transaction issuers (e.g., \DH{}App developers) with an estimate of how long transactions will take to be processed given a certain gas price. These estimation services are crucial in the Ethereum domain and several popular wallets such as Metamask rely on them. However, despite their key role, their accuracy has not been empirically investigated so far. In this article, we quantify the transaction processing times in Ethereum, investigate the relationship between processing times and gas prices, and determine the accuracy of state-of-the-practice estimation services. Our results indicate that transactions are processed in a median of 57 seconds and that 90% of the transactions are processed within 8 minutes. We also show that higher gas prices result in faster transaction processing times with diminishing returns. In particular, we observe no practical difference in processing time between expensive and very expensive transactions. With regards to the accuracy of processing time estimation services, we observe that they are equivalent. However, when stratifying transactions by gas prices, we observe that Etherscan’s Gas Tracker is the most accurate estimation service for the very cheap and cheap transactions. EthGasStation’s Gas Price API, in turn, is the most accurate estimation service for regular, expensive, and very expensive transactions. In a post-hoc study, we design a simple linear regression model with only one feature that outperforms the Gas Tracker for very cheap and cheap transactions and that performs as accurately as the EthGasStation model for the remaining categories. Based on our findings, \DH{}App developers can make more informed decisions concerning the choice of the gas price of their application-issued transactions.},

abstract = {Blockchain-based systems have gained immense popularity as enablers of independent asset transfers and smart contract functionality. They have also, since as early as the first Bitcoin blocks, been used for storing arbitrary contents such as texts and images. On-chain data storage functionality is useful for a variety of legitimate use cases. It does, however, also pose a systematic risk. If abused, for example by posting illegal contents on a public blockchain, data storage functionality can lead to legal consequences for operators and users that need to store and distribute the blockchain, thereby threatening the operational availability of entire blockchain ecosystems. In this paper, we develop and apply a cloud-based approach for quickly discovering and classifying content on public blockchains. Our method can be adapted to different blockchain systems and offers insights into content-related usage patterns and potential cases of abuse. We apply our method on the two most prominent public blockchain systems—Bitcoin and Ethereum—and discuss our results. To the best of our knowledge, the presented study is the first to systematically analyze non-financial content stored on the Ethereum blockchain and the first to present a side-by-side comparison between different blockchains in terms of the quality and quantity of stored data.},

abstract = {Energy storage provides an effective way of shifting temporal energy demands and supplies, which enables significant cost reduction under time-of-use energy pricing plans. Despite its promising benefits, the cost of present energy storage remains expensive, presenting a major obstacle to practical deployment. A more viable solution to improve the cost-effectiveness is by sharing energy storage, such as community sharing, cloud energy storage and peer-to-peer sharing. However, revealing private energy demand data to an external energy storage operator may compromise user privacy, and is susceptible to data misuses and breaches. In this paper, we explore a novel approach to support energy storage sharing with privacy protection, based on privacy-preserving blockchain and secure multi-party computation. We present an integrated solution to enable privacy-preserving energy storage sharing, such that energy storage service scheduling and cost-sharing can be attained without the knowledge of individual users' demands. It also supports auditing and verification by the grid operator via blockchain. Furthermore, our privacy-preserving solution can safeguard against a majority of dishonest users, who may collude in cheating, without requiring a trusted third-party. We implemented our solution as a smart contract on real-world Ethereum blockchain platform, and provided empirical evaluation in this paper1.},

While blockchain is in the stage of developing, thus there exists a lot of problems on these established blockchain applications. Supervision on chain data is one of these problems and it is always difficult, in order to resolve this problem, we propose a supervising method based on relay mechanism to monitor the chain data adaptively and to detect and control the abnormal data timely. We generate the data according to the data structure of the power distribution automation system for anomaly detection. The experimental results show that the proposed supervision algorithm detects abnormal power data in time, and adaptively updates the algorithm parameters according to the changes of the data on the chain, ensuring the accuracy of the detection results, and can help the supervisory unit to supervise the data on chain.},

abstract = {Retail energy markets are increasingly consumer-oriented, thanks to a growing number of energy plans offered by a plethora of energy suppliers, retailers and intermediaries. To maximize the benefits of competitive retail energy markets, group purchasing is an emerging paradigm that aggregates consumers' purchasing power by coordinating switch decisions to specific energy providers for discounted energy plans. Traditionally, group purchasing is mediated by a trusted third-party, which suffers from the lack of privacy and transparency. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm of decentralized privacy-preserving group purchasing, empowered by privacy-preserving blockchain and secure multi-party computation, to enable users to form a coalition for coordinated switch decisions in a decentralized manner, without a trusted third-party. The coordinated switch decisions are determined by a competitive online algorithm, based on users' private consumption data and current energy plan tariffs. Remarkably, no private user consumption data will be revealed to others in the online decision-making process, which is carried out in a transparently verifiable manner to eliminate frauds from dishonest users and supports fair mutual compensations by sharing the switching costs to incentivize group purchasing. We implemented our decentralized group purchasing solution as a smart contract on Solidity-supported blockchain platform (e.g., Ethereum), and provide extensive empirical evaluation.},

abstract = {Traditional public blockchain systems typically had very limited transaction throughput because of the bottleneck of the consensus protocol itself. With recent advances in consensus technology, the performance limit has been greatly lifted, typically to thousands of transactions per second. With this, transaction execution has become a new performance bottleneck. Exploiting parallelism in transaction execution is a clear and direct way to address this and to further increase transaction throughput. Although some recent literature introduced concurrency control mechanisms to execute smart contract transactions in parallel, the reported speedup that they can achieve is far from ideal. The main reason is that the proposed parallel execution mechanisms cannot effectively deal with the conflicts inherent in many blockchain applications.In this work, we thoroughly study the historical transaction execution traces in Ethereum. We observe that application-inherent conflicts are the major factors that limit the exploitable parallelism during execution. We propose to use partitioned counters and special commutative instructions to break up the application conflict chains in order to maximize the potential speedup. When we evaluated the maximum parallel speedup achievable, these techniques doubled this limit to an 18x overall speedup compared to serial execution, thus approaching the optimum. We also propose OCC-DA, an optimistic concurrency control scheduler with deterministic aborts, which makes it possible to use OCC scheduling in public blockchain settings.},

abstract = {Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have emerged as a way to collect digital art as well as an investment vehicle. Despite having been popularized only recently, NFT markets have witnessed several high-profile (and high-value) asset sales and a tremendous growth in trading volumes over the last year. Unfortunately, these marketplaces have not yet received much security scrutiny. Instead, most academic research has focused on attacks against decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and automated techniques to detect smart-contract vulnerabilities. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the market dynamics and security issues of the multi-billion dollar NFT ecosystem.In this paper, we first present a systematic overview of how the NFT ecosystem works, and we identify three major actors: marketplaces, external entities, and users. We then perform an in-depth analysis of the top 8 marketplaces (ranked by transaction volume) to discover potential issues, many of which can lead to substantial financial losses. We also collected a large amount of asset and event data pertaining to the NFTs being traded in the examined marketplaces. We automatically analyze this data to understand how the entities external to the blockchain are able to interfere with NFT markets, leading to serious consequences, and quantify the malicious trading behaviors carried out by users under the cloak of anonymity.},

abstract = {Fixing bugs is easiest by patching source code. However, source code is not always available: only 0.3% of the ∼ 49M smart contracts that are currently deployed on Ethereum have their source code publicly available. Moreover, since contracts may call functions from other contracts, security flaws in closed-source contracts may affect open-source contracts as well. However, current state-of-the-art approaches that operate on closed-source contracts (i.e.,&nbsp;EVM bytecode), such as EVMPatch and SmartShield, make use of purely hard-coded templates that leverage fix patching patterns. As a result, they cannot dynamically adapt to the bytecode that is being patched, which severely limits their flexibility and scalability. For instance, when patching integer overflows using hard-coded templates, a particular patch template needs to be employed as the bounds to be checked are different for each integer size (i.e.,&nbsp;one template for uint256, another template for uint64, etc.). In this paper, we propose Elysium, a scalable approach towards automatic smart contract repair at the bytecode level. Elysium combines template-based and semantic-based patching by inferring context information from bytecode. Elysium is currently able to patch 7 different types of vulnerabilities in smart contracts automatically and can easily be extended with new templates and new bug-finding tools. We evaluate its effectiveness and correctness using 3 different datasets by replaying more than 500K transactions on patched contracts. We find that Elysium outperforms existing tools by patching at least 30% more contracts correctly. Finally, we also compare the overhead of Elysium in terms of deployment and transaction cost. In comparison to other tools, we find that generally Elysium minimizes the runtime cost (i.e.,&nbsp;transaction cost) up to a factor of 1.7, for only a marginally higher deployment cost, where deployment cost is a one-time cost as compared to the runtime cost.},

abstract = {Out-of-gas errors occur when smart contract programs are provided with inputs that cause excessive gas consumption and which will be easily exploited to perform DoS attacks. Various approaches have been proposed to estimate the gas limit of a function in smart contracts to avoid such error. However, underestimation often occurs when the contract is complex In this work, we propose V-Gas, which automatically generates inputs that maximize the gas cost and reduce underestimation. V-Gas is designed based on static analysis and feedback-directed mutational fuzz testing. First, V-Gas builds the gas weighted control flow graph (WCFG) of functions in smart contracts. Then, V-Gas develops gas consumption guided selection and mutation strategies to generate the input that maximize the gas consumption. For evaluation, we implement V-Gas based on js-evm, a widely used ethereum virtual machine written in Javascript, and conduct experiments on 736 real-world transactions recorded on Ethereum. 44.02% of the transactions would have out-of-gas errors based on the estimation results given by solc, means that the recorded real gas consumption for those transactions is larger than the gas limit estimated by solc. In comparison V-Gas could reduce the under estimation ratio to 13.86%. In order to evaluate the performance of feedback-directed engine in V-Gas, we implemented other directed fuzzing engines and compare their performance with V-Gas’s. The results showed that V-Gas generates the same or higher gas estimation value on 97.8% of the transactions with less time, usually within 5 minutes. Furthermore, V-Gas has exposed 25 previously unknown out-of-gas vulnerabilities in widely-used smart contracts, 6 of which have been assigned unique CVE identifiers in the US National Vulnerability Database.},

abstract = {The Solidity programming language is the most widely used language for smart contract development. Improving smart contracts’ correctness, security, and performance has been the driving force for research in vulnerability detection, program analysis, and compiler techniques for Solidity. Similar to system-level languages such as C, Solidity enables the embedding of low-level code in programs, in the form of inline assembly code. Developers use inline assembly for low-level optimizations, extending the Solidity language through libraries, and using blockchain-specific opcodes only available through inline assembly. Nevertheless, inline assembly fragments are not well understood by an average developer and can introduce security threats as well as affect the optimizations that can be applied to programs by the compiler; it also significantly limits the effectiveness of source code static analyzers that operate on the Solidity level. A better understanding of how inline assembly is used in practice could in turn increase the performance, security, and support for inline assembly in Solidity. This paper presents a large-scale quantitative study of the use of inline assembly in 6.8M smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. We find that 23% of the analyzed smart contracts contain inline assembly code, and that the use of inline assembly has become more widespread over time. We further performed a manual qualitative analysis for identifying usage patterns of inline assembly in Solidity smart contracts. Our findings are intended to help practitioners understand when they should use inline assembly and guide developers of Solidity tools in prioritizing which parts of inline assembly to implement first. Finally, the insights of this study could be used to enhance the Solidity language, improve the Solidity compiler, and to open up new research directions by driving future researchers to build appropriate methods and techniques for replacing inline assembly in Solidity programs when there is no real necessity to use it.},

abstract = {We present a measurement study on compositions of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols, which aim to disrupt traditional finance and offer services on top of distributed ledgers, such as Ethereum. Understanding DeFi compositions is of great importance, as they may impact the development of ecosystem interoperability, are increasingly integrated with web technologies, and may introduce risks through complexity. Starting from a dataset of 23 labeled DeFi protocols and 10,663,881 associated Ethereum accounts, we study the interactions of protocols and associated smart contracts. From a network perspective, we find that decentralized exchange (DEX) and lending protocol account nodes have high degree and centrality values, that interactions among protocol nodes primarily occur in a strongly connected component, and that known community detection methods cannot disentangle DeFi protocols. Therefore, we propose an algorithm to decompose a protocol call into a nested set of building blocks that may be part of other DeFi protocols. This allows us to untangle and study protocol compositions. With a ground truth dataset that we have collected, we can demonstrate the algorithm’s capability by finding that swaps are the most frequently used building blocks. As building blocks can be nested, that is, contained in each other, we provide visualizations of composition trees for deeper inspections. We also present a broad picture of DeFi compositions by extracting and flattening the entire nested building block structure across multiple DeFi protocols. Finally, to demonstrate the practicality of our approach, we present a case study that is inspired by the recent collapse of the UST stablecoin in the Terra ecosystem. Under the hypothetical assumption that the stablecoin USD Tether would experience a similar fate, we study which building blocks — and, thereby, DeFi protocols — would be affected. Overall, our results and methods contribute to a better understanding of a new family of financial products.},

However, the development of blockchain technology has promoted the birth of a new type of software system–decentralized applications. Composed of smart contracts, a type of application that implements the Ponzi scheme logic (called smart Ponzi schemes) has caused irreversible loss and hindered the development of blockchain technology. These smart contracts generally had a short life but involved a large amount of money. Whereas identification of these Ponzi schemes before causing financial loss has been significantly important, existing methods suffer from three main deficiencies, i.e., the insufficient dataset, the reliance on the transaction records, and the low accuracy. In this study, we first build a larger dataset. Then, a large number of features from multiple views, including bytecode, semantic, and developers, are extracted. These features are independent of the transaction records. Furthermore, we leveraged machine learning methods to build our identification model, i.e., Multi-view Cascade Ensemble model (MulCas). The experiment results show that MulCas can achieve higher performance and robustness in the scope of our dataset. Most importantly, the proposed method can identify smart Ponzi scheme at the creation time.},

However, traditional federated learning still faces the challenge of security and data heterogeneity. Specifically, the central server will introduce a single point of failure. Malicious clients and statistical heterogeneity of data will affect the performance of the model. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes FedDetectionBC, a federated learning framework for object detection model training, which takes advantage of blockchain to ensure the robustness and auditability of federated learning. To deal with data heterogeneity, a new algorithm (Exchange-FedAvg) is also proposed. Experimental results that FedDetectionBC is more robust than traditional federated learning when there exist malicious clients in the system.

abstract = {Smart contracts are self-executing computer programs deployed on blockchain to enable trustworthy exchange of value without the need of a central authority. With the absence of documentation and specifications, routine tasks such as program understanding, maintenance, verification, and validation, remain challenging for smart contracts. In this paper, we propose a dynamic invariant detection tool, InvCon, for Ethereum smart contracts to mitigate this issue. The detected invariants can be used to not only support the reverse engineering of contract specifications, but also enable standard-compliance checking for contract implementations. InvCon provides a Web-based interface and a demonstration video of it is available at: https://youtu.be/Y1QBHjDSMYk.},

abstract = {In the world of cryptocurrencies, public listing of a new token often generates significant hype, in many cases causing its price to skyrocket in a few seconds. In this scenario, timing is crucial to determine the success or failure of an investment opportunity. In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of sniper bots, automated tools designed to buy tokens as soon as they are listed on the market. We leverage GitHub open-source repositories of sniper bots to analyze their features and how they are implemented. Then, we build a dataset of Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain (BSC) liquidity pools to identify addresses that serially take advantage of sniper bots. Our findings reveal 14,029 sniping operations on Ethereum and 1,395,042 in BSC that bought tokens for a total of $10,144,808 dollars and $18,720,447, respectively. We find that Ethereum operations have a higher success rate but require a larger investment. Finally, we analyze token smart contracts to identify mechanisms that can hinder sniper bots.},

abstract = {Improving the quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE) for users of cyber-physical systems (CPS) is the key to the widespread promotion and deployment of this technology. Network latency is an important factor affecting users' network experience. Due to the limited processing capacity of a single device node of CPS, the communication relationship between equipment is extremely complicated, and multi-hop device nodes may be passed through in the middle, so designing an efficient routing scheme for CPS is a serious challenge. CPS routing also faces a security crisis. System nodes may send viruses or erroneous results to user equipment, and user equipment may also refuse to pay for routing services to system nodes. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a secure routing scheme based on blockchain. Blockchain is used to ensure secure transactions between system nodes and user equipment. At the same time, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technology is used, and two deep neural networks are used to train intelligent agent to achieve low-latency adaptive traffic scheduling. Experimental results show that the proposed autonomous routing technology can reduce the system communication latency by about 31.7%-45.4%.},

abstract = {Blockchain has attracted more and more attention of academia, industry and government in recent decade. Different usage demands have inspired various blockchain designs, forming different blockchain systems, which however leads to information islands. Many cross-chain technologies have been proposed to link different blockchains together and expand the utility of blockchain. Nevertheless, the cross-chain technology is still in its infancy, which faces many problems that retard its wide application, for example, the issues related to security, privacy and effectiveness. In order to further investigate cross-chain technologies, it is essential to understand its current state of arts. Although there are some surveys about cross-chain technologies driven by specific demands, the literature still lacks a comprehensive survey focusing on security, privacy and effectiveness of cross-chain technologies. In this paper, we provide a review on existing cross-chain technologies based on a comprehensive set of criteria on security, privacy and other performance. We first propose a blockchain interoperability architecture for the purpose of analyzing potential threats and problems regarding security, privacy and effectiveness. We then summarize a set of criteria regarding these quality attributes. Next, we comprehensively review the representative works on cross-chain technologies according to a taxonomy based on applied types of techniques and cross-chain purposes. In each work review, we provide a serious discussion on its pros and cons by employing our proposed criteria. Finally, based on our review and analysis, we figure out a number of open issues and step ahead to direct future research directions on cross-chain technologies.},

Contracts in SigVM can emit signal events, on which other contracts can listen. Once an event is triggered, corresponding handler functions are automatically executed as signal transactions. We build an end-to-end blockchain platform SigChain and a contract language compiler SigSolid to realize the potential of SigVM. Experimental results show that our benchmark applications can be reimplemented with SigVM in a truly decentralized way, eliminating the dependency on centralized and unreliable mechanisms like off-chain relay servers. The development effort of reimplementing these contracts with SigVM is small, i.e., we modified on average 3.17% of the contract code. The runtime and the gas overhead of SigVM on these contracts is negligible.},

Open source licenses such as GPL, MIT, Apache, Mozilla, BSD, etc have varying terms and conditions for usage, modification, and distribution. Given the availability of source code for open source software, it is difficult to scrutinize adherence of licenses and more often than not it is left to the good faith of organizations and individuals. Violation of licensing terms knowingly or unknowingly can lead to copyright, ethical, compliance and security issues. In this paper, we propose a blockchain based approach in managing open source software licenses by enforcing certain practices to improve awareness and increase transparency, thus minimizing the possibility of violations. We present a solution design that relies on the use of 4 modules: InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), Smart contracts, Transaction manager (Meta-Mask) and a Permissioned Blockchain to enforce the conformance of licenses.},

abstract = {Ethereum is a blockchain platform that enables the use of smart contracts. Smart contracts will execute a set of instructions without an intermediary party when called upon. The possibility to make calls to another contract or exchange cryptocurrency allows for potential exploits to occur, most notable reentrancy. The Solidity language for coding smart contracts has syntactic constructs created to be safer alternatives, and guards to aid in securing code against exploits. In this paper, we collect a total of 26,799 verified Solidity smart contracts from Etherscan, to analyze the language constructs used in calling another contract or exchanging ether. We also analyze the usage of guards to make the code more secure. For instance, even though call is the unsafest function, it is still used by 50% of the contracts in our dataset. The safe method transfer is used by approximately one-third of contracts, and send is rarely used. We noticed that contracts using call have a higher average and median size in Lines of Code than normal. We also found an increased percentage of call contracts using more guards. Moreover, 97% of all contracts are using the require guard, with 23 uses of require on average per contract. This may be an indication that Solidity developers are using more guards to prevent exploits in their contracts},

As the core part of the DeFi ecosystem, decentralized lending protocols allow users to become lenders or borrowers in a completely decentralized fashion, such that an individual has complete control over their funds at all times. Collecting, analyzing, and visualizing lending data are crucial as these lending protocols are growing steadily. This paper presents an analysis model for decentralized lending protocols. Our main contributions are as follows. (i) We analyze and compare the top lending protocols; (ii) We present a general model to collect and process a large amount of data from multiple lending protocols in an exact and efficient manner; (iii) We design and implement a lending visualization system with various charts divided into three categories, i.e., lending market overview, token analysis, and user analysis.},

abstract = {Smart grids leverage the data collected from smart meters to make important operational decisions. However, they are vulnerable to False Data Injection (FDI) attacks in which an attacker manipulates meter data to disrupt the grid operations. Existing works on FDI are based on a simple threat model in which a single grid operator has access to all the data, and only some meters can be compromised.Our goal is to secure smart grids against FDI under a realistic threat model. To this end, we present a threat model in which there are multiple operators, each with a partial view of the grid, and each can be fully compromised. An effective defense against FDI in this setting is to share data between the operators. However, the main challenge here is to incentivize data sharing. We address this by proposing an incentive mechanism that rewards operators for uploading data, but penalizes them if the data is missing or anomalous. We derive formal conditions under which our incentive mechanism is provably secure against operators who withhold or distort measurement data for profit. We then implement the data sharing solution on a private blockchain, introducing several optimizations that overcome the inherent performance limitations of the blockchain. Finally, we conduct an experimental evaluation that demonstrates that our implementation has practical performance.},

Questions based on previous incidents interactively support the classification. Post submission a security incident response committee then discusses these observations on our decentralized platform to decide on an appropriate response. For evaluation, we implement our model as a decentralized application and demonstrate its practical suitability in a preliminary user study.},

Initial approaches attempt to solve this problem by using centralised systems with trusted authorities. However, sharing vaccine passport data between different organisations, regions and countries has become a major challenge. A platform for creating, storing and verifying digital COVID-19 vaccine certifications is presented, making use of InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to guarantee that there is no single point of failure and to allow data to be securely distributed globally. Blockchain and smart contracts are also integrated into the platform to explicitly determine policies and log access rights to the passport data while ensuring all actions are audited and verifiably immutable. Our proposed platform realises General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements in terms of user consent, data encryption, data erasure and accountability obligations. We assess the scalability and performance of the platform using IPFS and Blockchain test networks.},

abstract = {With the explosion of COVID-19 cases and the government’s needs to control virus spreading, the development of effective and robust systems for managing vaccination certificates to restrict citizens’ activities has been in the centre of many governments. This paper proposes a system that allows for the update of the status of certificates and bases its function on a specific form of logs stored on Blockchains and a set of rules for the interpretation of these logs. Also an outline of a proof of concept implementation of the system in Ethereum together with a cost and security analysis are provided in the paper. The proposed architecture provides several benefits with the most prominent one being the suspension of certificates in case an already vaccinated individual is found positive. In existing certificate management systems a vaccinated individual that is tested positive still holds a valid vaccination certificate during the self-isolation period. This vulnerability allows infected individuals to commute freely and thus facilitates the spread of the pandemic. The proposed solution is not limited to COVID-19 related certificates, but rather it could be deployed in any kind of digital certificate.},

abstract = {The number of fake news written by bots or malicious actors on social media is rising. One cause is the ability of users to post anything, at any place, at any time. This offers great flexibility, but it also poses the risk that users share misinformation. One type includes events that allegedly have occurred in a location, without the reporting user necessarily having been present. A user may add her location to posts to appear as an eyewitness and thus more trustworthy; however, basing that trust on commonly used and easily faked GPS locations is not reasonable.We present EventChain, which enriches social media posts with hard to fake trust scores based on the user's recent motion profile to give actual eyewitnesses more credibility. Users' motion profiles are integrity- and privacy-preservingly logged in a blockchain. Once the user posts an event, her locality is evaluated for a location rating. The location evaluation is secured by a trusted execution environment to ensure users' location data is private and under the users' control at all times. EventChain also enables interactive assessments of a post via nearby users, whose location is similarly evaluated. This way other eyewitnesses can credibly provide further information, thus leading to a consensus about the event's actual occurrences, increasing trust in social media posts, and limiting the spread of fake news.},

This implies that the micro network operator dedicated to a specific sector of users has the potential to improve the 5G architecture in terms of scalability and autonomy. However, the traditional AKA protocol does not allow the micro operator to authenticate mobile users independently. To solve this problem, we propose the Fast AKA protocol, which disseminates a subscriber’s profile among base stations via a Blockchain and mutually authenticates the subscriber and serving base station locally for roaming. The proposed architecture speeds up the authentication process, provides forward/backward secrecy, and resists replay attack as well as man-in-the-middle attack. We believe that Fast AKA can serve as a cornerstone for B5G.},

In this paper, we propose a data sharing scheme for location data based on a high-performance consortium blockchain combined with proxy re-encryption, which can guarantee location data sharing under user authorization while ensure the efficiency and security in the process of data sharing. The performance analysis and simulation results illustrate that the proposed scheme can meet the performance requirements in practical scenarios, guarantee the privacy of personal location data while making the data useful for stemming the spread of COVID-19.},

abstract = {Blockchain, as a distributed ledger technology, becomes increasingly popular, especially for enabling valuable cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. However, the blockchain software systems inevitably have many bugs. Although bugs in smart contracts have been extensively investigated, security bugs of the underlying blockchain systems are much less explored. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on blockchain’s system vulnerabilities from four representative blockchains, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, and Stellar. Specifically, we first design a systematic filtering process to effectively identify 1,037 vulnerabilities and their 2,317 patches from 34,245 issues/PRs (pull requests) and 85,164 commits on GitHub. We thus build the first blockchain vulnerability dataset, which is available at https://github.com/VPRLab/BlkVulnDataset. We then perform unique analyses of this dataset at three levels, including (i) file-level vulnerable module categorization by identifying and correlating module paths across projects, (ii) text-level vulnerability type clustering by natural language processing and similarity-based sentence clustering, and (iii) code-level vulnerability pattern analysis by generating and clustering code change signatures that capture both syntactic and semantic information of patch code fragments. Our analyses reveal three key findings: (i) some blockchain modules are more susceptible than the others; notably, each of the modules related to consensus, wallet, and networking has over 200 issues; (ii) about 70% of blockchain vulnerabilities are of traditional types, but we also identify four new types specific to blockchains; and (iii) we obtain 21 blockchain-specific vulnerability patterns that capture unique blockchain attributes and statuses, and demonstrate that they can be used to detect similar vulnerabilities in other popular blockchains, such as Dogecoin, Bitcoin SV, and Zcash.},

abstract = {The prosperity of decentralized finance motivates many investors to profit via trading their crypto assets on decentralized applications (DApps for short) of the Ethereum ecosystem. Apart from Ether (the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum), many ERC20 (a widely used token standard on Ethereum) tokens obtain vast market value in the ecosystem. Specifically, the approval mechanism is used to delegate the privilege of spending users’ tokens to DApps. By doing so, the DApps can transfer these tokens to arbitrary receivers on behalf of the users. To increase the usability, unlimited approval is commonly adopted by DApps to reduce the required interaction between them and their users. However, as shown in existing security incidents, this mechanism can be abused to steal users’ tokens. In this paper, we present the first systematic study to quantify the risk of unlimited approval of ERC20 tokens on Ethereum. Specifically, by evaluating existing transactions up to 31st July 2021, we find that unlimited approval is prevalent (60%, 15.2M/25.4M) in the ecosystem, and 22% of users have a high risk of their approved tokens for stealing. After that, we investigate the security issues that are involved in interacting with the UIs of 22 representative DApps and 9 famous wallets to prepare the approval transactions. The result reveals the worrisome fact that all DApps request unlimited approval from the front-end users and only 10% (3/31) of UIs provide explanatory information for the approval mechanism. Meanwhile, only 16% (5/31) of UIs allow users to modify their approval amounts. Finally, we take a further step to characterize the user behavior into five modes and formalize the good practice, i.e., on-demand approval and timely spending, towards securely spending approved tokens. However, the evaluation result suggests that only 0.2% of users follow the good practice to mitigate the risk. Our study sheds light on the risk of unlimited approval and provides suggestions to secure the approval mechanism of the ERC20 tokens on Ethereum.},

abstract = {Publish/subscribe is a scalable communication method for one-to-many communications. Centralized Pub/Sub protocols rely on a centralized broker that is a trusted third party managing the subscriptions. To prevent data alteration by the broker, or by an entity outside of the system, the literature proposes E2E security solutions. The issue with this solution is that they all introduce a third party who is hardly trustable in practice. Recently, Pub/Sub protocols have been proposed using the blockchain to manage the subscriptions and provable data deliveries. In this paper, we focus our work on one publish/subscribe protocol, called SUPRA, that uses the blockchain only when necessary. We explain why the current version of the protocol does not respect the publish/subscribe paradigm because a subscriber has to encrypt and sign each data as many times as there are subscribers. Then, present how to update the protocol in order for each data to be encrypted and signed only once, regardless of the number of subscribers, while keeping the security properties of the protocol. The result is a publish/subscribe protocol with strong delivery guarantees and traceability that can be used to share sensitive data.},

abstract = {The blockchain-powered decentralized applications and systems have been widely deployed in recent years. The decentralization feature promises users anonymity, security, and non-censorship, which is especially welcomed in the areas of decentralized finance and digital assets. From the perspective of most common users, a decentralized ecosystem means every service follows the principle of decentralization. However, we find that the services in a decentralized ecosystem still may contain centralized components or scenarios, like third-party SDKs and privileged operations, which violate the promise of decentralization and may cause a series of centralized security risks. In this work, we systematically study the centralized security risks existing in decentralized ecosystems. Specifically, we identify seven centralized security risks in the deployment of two typical decentralized services – crypto wallets and DApps, such as anonymity loss and overpowered owner. Also, to measure these risks in the wild, we designed an automated detection tool called Naga and carried out large-scale experiments. Based on the measurement of 28 Ethereum crypto wallets (Android version) and 110,506 on-chain smart contracts, the result shows that the centralized security risks are widespread. Up to 96.4% of wallets and 83.5% of contracts exist at least one security risk, including 260 well-known tokens with a total market cap of over $98 billion.},

However, the drawbacks of centralized storage, data leakage risk, and the lack of trust mechanisms among entities exposed by traditional data sharing models have seriously reduced users' willingness to share data and hindered the maximization of data value. Blockchain technology, which has emerged and gradually popularized, provides new ideas for secure data sharing by virtue of its decentralization, traceability, trustlessness and programmability, but a series of problems such as compatibility, performance, security and privacy have also brought serious challenges to it. According to the research results in recent years, we conduct an overview of the layered technology architecture of blockchain-based secure data sharing model by particularly emphasizing on the distributed storage technology, data sharing mechanisms and associated cryptography algorithms.

In a VCS infrastructure, sensing devices and computing units hold on smart cars as well as cloud server form an IoT-edge-cloud continuum to perform real-time sensing tasks. In order to encourage the smart cars to participate the real-time VCS process, blockchain technology can be combined with VCS to provide automated incentive for VCS data trading without relying on trusted third parties. However, directly using blockchain to enforce VCS data trading process incurs expensive service fees and participants still can conduct various misbehavior. In this paper, we propose a secure blockchain-based data trading system for VCS named BTT system to address the above issues. In particular, we first integrate the blockchain-based data trading process with a lightweight privacy-preserving truth discovery algorithm to ensure the accuracy of sensing data while preserving data privacy. we then propose a gas-aware optimization mechanism to minimize the gas consumption of the data trading process. Finally, we carefully design a distributed judgment mechanism to regulate all participants to behave correctly in the data trading process. To demonstrate the practicability of our design, we implement a prototype of BTT system deployed on Ethereum test network and conduct extensive simulations.},

The first block of the chain is the creation block, which is the beginning of the whole chain data structure. This topic studies the design of transmission line allocation algorithm based on blockchain. This paper considers a power communication network scenario using blockchain technology, which includes a power cloud platform and edge servers. In the process of scheduling storage resources, this paper mainly defines resource scheduling preferences according to resource reliability, resource confidence, storage performance and network cost. The research shows that the algorithm in this paper will choose to upload some high-priority and large-scale services, which affects the delay optimization, but compared with the delay optimization algorithm, its delay is only about 0.051s worse. Some nodes join the core nodes, thus increasing the transmission cost, but the core ratio keeps increasing, and the transmission costs of the two nodes are balanced and reach the maximum value.},

abstract = {In a blockchain-based system, the lack of centralized control requires active participation and cooperative behaviors of system entities to ensure system security and sustainability. However, dynamic environments and unpredictable entity behaviors challenge the performances of such systems in practice. Therefore, designing a feasible incentive mechanism to regulate entity behaviors becomes essential to improve blockchain system performance. The prosperous characteristics of blockchain can also contribute to an effective incentive mechanism. Unfortunately, current literature still lacks a thorough survey on incentive mechanisms related to the blockchain to understand how incentive mechanisms and blockchain make each other better. To this end, we propose evaluation requirements in terms of the properties and costs of incentive mechanisms. On the one hand, we provide a taxonomy of the incentive mechanisms of blockchain systems according to blockchain versions, incentive forms, and incentive goals. On the other hand, we categorize blockchain-based incentive mechanisms according to application scenarios and incentive goals. During the review, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of state-of-the-art incentive mechanisms based on the proposed evaluation requirements. Through careful review, we present how incentive mechanisms and blockchain benefit with each other, discover a number of unresolved issues, and point out corresponding potential directions for future research.},

abstract = {A blockchain is a form of distributed ledger technology where transactions as data state changes are permanently recorded securely and transparently without the need for third parties. Besides, introducing smart contracts to the blockchain has added programmability, revolutionizing the software ecosystem toward decentralized applications. Although promising, the usability of smart contracts is primarily limited to on-chain data without access to the external systems (i.e., off-chain) where real-world data and events reside. This connectability to off-chain data for smart contracts and blockchain is an open practical problem referred to as the “oracle problem” and is defined as how real-world data can be transferred into/from the blockchain. Hence, Blockchain oracles are introduced and implemented in the form of application programming interfaces connecting the real world to the blockchain for mitigating such a limitation. This article studies and analyzes how blockchain oracles provide final feedback (i.e., outcome) to smart contracts and survey blockchain oracle technologies and mechanisms regarding data integrity and correctness. Since the existing solutions are extensive in terms of characteristics and usage, we investigate their structure and principles by classifying the blockchain oracle implementation techniques into two major groups voting-based strategies and reputation-based ones. The former mainly relies on participants’ stakes for outcome finalization, while the latter considers reputation and performance metrics in conjunction with authenticity-proof mechanisms for data correctness and integrity. We present the result of this classification with a thorough discussion of the state of the art and provide the remaining challenges and future research directions in the end.},

Different values are assigned corresponding to the object's importance in the region and the ownership of the area is managed and given to the required user. The detected areas are individually encrypted by XOR cipher, and a corresponding key image is created to decrypt to protect ownership of selected object regions detected by the object recognition algorithm. We use non-fungible tokens(NFTs) to secure key images by managing ownership of each object on image data. Key images to decrypt are registered as NFTs. Ownership NFTs are also created to access and retrieve the key image NFTs. Each key image NFT is generated by key holders and ownership NFTs are obtained by users requiring them. In addition, there is a judging function that clarifies if ownership and key NFTs match. Key NFTs appear on the screen only when they are matched.With this method, we can give different value to partial areas of image and ensure ownership of them. Besides, ownership can be transferred and shared with multiple people. Furthermore, original image holders can get financial profit depending on how valuable the images are. Lastly, this method would improve securing image data.},

Nevertheless, the traditional data deduplication models which support public auditing can endure the enormous waste of storage and computation resources induced through data redundancy and repeated audit work by multiple tenants on trusted third-party auditor (TPA). In this work, we introduce blockchain-based secure decentralized public auditing in a decentralized cloud storage with an efficient deduplication model. We employ blockchain to take on the task of centralized TPA, which also mitigates the implications of malicious blockchain miners by using the concept of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Specifically, we employ the idea of redactability for blockchain to handle often neglected security issues that would adversely affect the integrity of stored auditing records on blockchain in decentralized auditing models. On the other hand, the proposed model also employs an efficient deduplication scheme to attain adequate storage savings while preserving the users from data loss due to duplicate faking attacks. Moreover, the detailed concrete security analysis demonstrates the computational infeasibility of the proposed model against proof-of-ownership, duplicate faking attack (DFA), collusion attack, storage free-riding attack, data privacy, and forgery attack; with high efficiency. Finally, the comprehensive performance analysis shows the scalability and feasibility of the proposed model.},

There are many challenging issues in federated learning, such as coordinating participants’ activities, arbitrating their benefits, and aggregating models. Most existing solutions employ a centralized approach, in which a trustworthy central authority is needed for coordination. Such an approach incurs many disadvantages, including vulnerability to attacks, lack of credibility, and difficulty in calculating rewards. Recently, blockchain was identified as a potential solution for addressing the abovementioned issues. Extensive research has been conducted, and many approaches, methods, and techniques have been proposed. There is a need for a systematic survey to examine how blockchain can empower federated learning. Although there are many surveys on federated learning, few of them cover blockchain as an enabling technology. This work comprehensively surveys challenges, solutions, and future directions for blockchain-empowered federated learning (BlockFed). First, we identify the critical issues in federated learning and explain why blockchain provides a potential approach to addressing these issues. Second, we categorize existing system models into three classes: decoupled, coupled, and overlapped, according to how the federated learning and blockchain functions are integrated. Then we compare the advantages and disadvantages of these three system models, regard the disadvantages as challenging issues in BlockFed, and investigate corresponding solutions. Finally, we identify and discuss the future directions, including open problems in BlockFed.},

Nevertheless, there are some serious concerns about the trustworthiness of blockchain due to the vulnerabilities in on-chain algorithmic mechanisms, and tedious disputes and debates in off-chain communities. Accordingly, blockchain governance has received great attention for improving the trustworthiness of all decisions that direct a blockchain platform. However, there is a lack of systematic knowledge to guide practitioners to perform blockchain governance. We have performed a systematic literature review to understand the state-of-the-art of blockchain governance. We identify the lifecycle stages of a blockchain platform, and present 14 architectural patterns for blockchain governance in this study. This pattern language can provide guidance for the effective use of patterns for blockchain governance in practice, and support the architecture design of governance-driven blockchain systems.},

abstract = {With the recent advent of blockchains, we have witnessed a plethora of blockchain proposals. These proposals range from using work to using time, storage or stake in order to select blocks to be appended to the chain. As a drawback it makes it difficult for the application developer to choose the right blockchain to support their applications. In particular, the scalability and performance one can obtain from a specific blockchain is typically unknown. The claimed results are often obtained in isolation by the developers of the blockchain themselves. The experimental conditions corresponding to these results are generally missing and the lack of details make these results irreproducible.In this paper, we propose the most extensive evaluation of blockchain to date. First, we show how the experimental settings impact the performance of 6 state-of-the-art blockchains and argue for more detailed experiments. Second, and to cope with this limitation, we propose a unifying framework to evaluate blockchains on the same ground. The framework includes a suite of 5 realistic Decentralized Applications (DApps), helps deploy the blockchain nodes at different scales and evaluate their performance. Finally, we show that selecting a particular virtual machine or weakening guarantees can help handle computationally demanding workloads but that none of the tested blockchains can yet support the load of these realistic DApps.},

abstract = {We present LedgerView -- a system that adds access control views to permissioned blockchains. The approach is motivated by an AT&amp;T application of tracking refurbished devices. A blockchain is a decentralized tamper-resistant ledger managed by a group of peers. It is used in many applications for storing and sharing sensitive information, e.g., monetary transactions, health records, personal documents, etc. But in blockchain, all the peers see all the stored transactions, while in some applications, access to sensitive information should be limited, that is, concealed from peers and users who do not have proper access permissions. In database management systems, sets of records that are visible to some users and concealed from others are defined by views, but existing blockchain systems lack such access-control capabilities. Thus, in this paper, we introduce access-control views for Hyperledger Fabric. We present two types of views -- irrevocable and revocable, according to whether access to sensitive information can or cannot be revoked. We explain how to implement the two types of view by using cryptographic hash functions and encryption keys, and we show how to support Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Experiments with supply chain transactions illustrate the incurred costs of the views in LedgerView, including latency, transaction rate and storage overhead.},

abstract = {The execution of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain consumes gas paid for by users submitting contracts' invocation requests. A contract execution proceeds as long as the users dedicate enough gas, within the limit set by Ethereum. If insufficient gas is provided, the contract execution halts and changes made during execution get reverted. Unfortunately, contracts may contain code patterns that increase execution cost, causing the contracts to run out of gas. These patterns can be manipulated by malicious attackers to induce unwanted behavior in the targeted victim contracts, e.g., Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. We call these gas-related vulnerabilities. We propose eTainter, a static analyzer for detecting gas-related vulnerabilities based on taint tracking in the bytecode of smart contracts. We evaluate eTainter by comparing it with the prior work, MadMax, on a dataset of annotated contracts. The results show that eTainter outperforms MadMax in both precision and recall, and that eTainter has a precision of 90% based on manual inspection. We also use eTainter to perform large-scale analysis of 60,612 real-world contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. We find that gas-related vulnerabilities exist in 2,763 of these contracts, and that eTainter analyzes a contract in eight seconds, on average.},

News reports frequently bear witness to scams, hacked exchanges, and fortunes beyond retrieval. However, we lack a systematic understanding of user-centered cryptocurrency threats, as causes leading to loss are scattered across publications. To address this gap, we conducted a focus group (n=6) and an expert elicitation study (n=25) following a three-round Delphi process with a heterogeneous group of blockchain and security experts from academia and industry. We contribute the first systematic overview of threats cryptocurrency users are exposed to and propose six overarching categories. Our work is complemented by a discussion on how the human-computer-interaction community can address these threats and how practitioners can use the model to understand situations in which users might find themselves under the pressure of an attack to ultimately engineer more secure systems.},

abstract = {Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) has been extensively applied in various types of conditional access control systems since its introduction because of its ability to provide fine-grained and flexible access control to confidential data, thus offering a safe and effective data sharing environment. However, while developing rapidly, the existing CP-ABE access schemes also face some problems, such as trustworthiness issues involving third-party intermediary entities, secret key management problems brought by single attribute authorization centers, and privacy leakage of attributes. How to achieve safe and effective decentralized access control has been a problem to be explored and solved. In this paper, a trustworthy, secure, and efficient ABE(TSE ABE) based on blockchain and fast attribute-based message encryption (FAME) is proposed by us. First, we combine blockchain and FAME and optimize them to make CP-ABE perform better. Second, we implement a trusted authorization model with multiple entities based on the BLS signature and smart contracts to address key privacy issues. Finally, we protect the privacy of attributes in the authorization matching process by RSA encryption algorithm. Through the experimental results, it can be found that the scheme not only has good security and execution performance but also achieves effective protection of user privacy.},

abstract = {Web3, based on blockchain technology, is the evolving next generation Internet of value. Massive active applications on Web3, e.g. DeFi and NFT, usually rely on blockchain transactions to achieve value transfer as well as complex and diverse custom logic and intentions. Various risky or illegal behaviors such as financial fraud, hacking, money laundering are currently rampant in the blockchain ecosystem, and it is thus important to understand the intent behind the pseudonymous transactions. To reveal the intent of transactions, much effort has been devoted to extracting some particular transaction semantics through specific expert experiences. However, the limitations of existing methods in terms of effectiveness and generalization make it difficult to extract diverse transaction semantics in the rapidly growing and evolving Web3 ecosystem. In this paper, we propose the Motif-based Transaction Semantics representation method (MoTS), which can capture the transaction semantic information in the real-time transaction data workflow. To the best of our knowledge, MoTS is the first general semantic extraction method in Web3 blockchain ecosystem. Experimental results show that MoTS can effectively distinguish different transaction semantics in real-time, and can be used for various downstream tasks, giving new insights to understand the Web3 blockchain ecosystem. Our codes are available at https://github.com/wuzhy1ng/MoTS.},

This paper proposes a data privacy protection and fingerprint tracing method based on the features of decentralization, traceability and non-tampering in blockchain technology. And we combined with the protection of data by secure network platform in trusted computing and differential-traceability algorithm (DTA). We propose a data privacy protection and fingerprint traceability method, and use the SkipList table index structure to improve interaction efficiency. We discuss the proposed data fingerprint-based traceability framework model in a trusted environment using the features of blockchain and trusted computing platforms. In this paper, the data can be processed safely and efficiently to solve the privacy problem, the transaction data is encrypted and recorded on the chain by DTA, and the interaction process uses the SkipList table index to enhance retrieval efficiency. Finally, through multiple experiments and comparison of the results obtained from security testing, it is verified that the blockchain-trusted computing data privacy protection and data fingerprint traceability SkipList table indexing method can achieve traceability for data privacy protection, transaction security management and peer-to-peer verification of encryption and decryption algorithms. We not only provide a secure, trustworthy and efficient data privacy protection model, but also bring a time efficiency optimization of 6ms per 10,000 queries.},

abstract = {While permissioned blockchains enable a family of data center applications, existing systems suffer from imbalanced loads across compute and memory, exacerbating the underutilization of cloud resources. This paper presents FlexChain, a novel permissioned blockchain system that addresses this challenge by physically disaggregating CPUs, DRAM, and storage devices to process different blockchain workloads efficiently. Disaggregation allows blockchain service providers to upgrade and expand hardware resources independently to support a wide range of smart contracts with diverse CPU and memory demands. Moreover, it ensures efficient resource utilization and hence prevents resource fragmentation in a data center. We have explored the design of XOV blockchain systems in a disaggregated fashion and developed a tiered key-value store that can elastically scale its memory and storage. Our design significantly speeds up the execution stage. We have also leveraged several techniques to parallelize the validation stage in FlexChain to further improve the overall blockchain performance. Our evaluation results show that FlexChain can provide independent compute and memory scalability, while incurring at most 12.8% disaggregation overhead. FlexChain achieves almost identical throughput as the state-of-the-art distributed approaches with significantly lower memory and CPU consumption for compute-intensive and memory-intensive workloads respectively.},

This study believes that blockchain technology can be used to build a massive private data retrieval and sharing platform, considering the realization of privacy protection under horizontal federated learning and vertical federated learning, combined with privacy computing technology, to verify the results of massive data retrieval, and to build a "data availability that is not available." The "visible" security reduction model involves three cryptographic algorithms, namely functional encryption, zero-knowledge proof and asymmetric encryption. By combining blockchain and cloud servers, a hybrid storage architecture with data storage on the chain and off-chain storage is realized. And use function encryption and zero-knowledge proof to achieve privacy protection and secure data sharing of verifiable results. The final experimental results prove that the security feasibility of this model is proposed in this paper, which can fully improve the level of data log security management, operation and maintenance supervision, and the quality and efficiency of data security protection, and improve the network security protection system of the power grid in all scenarios.},

Doing so is trivial if the mechanism is allowed to observe all actions taken in the game, as this allows it to simply punish those agents who deviate from the intended strategy. Instead, we consider an abstraction where the mechanism probabilistically infers information about the outcome of the game. We show that payment schemes can be used to implement any set of utilities if and only if the mechanism can essentially infer completely what happened. We show that finding an optimal payment scheme for games of perfect information is P-complete, and conjecture it to be PPAD-hard for games of imperfect information. We prove a lower bound on the size of the payments, showing that the payments must be linear in the intended level of security. We demonstrate the applicability of our model to concrete problems in distributed computing, namely decentralized commerce and secure multiparty computation, for which the payments match the lower bound asymptotically.},

In this paper, we focus on sandwich attacks, where attackers take advantage of the transaction confirmation delay and cause financial losses for victims. We evaluate the impact and investigate users’ perceptions of sandwich attacks through a mix-method study. We find that due to users’ lack of technical background and insufficient notifications from the markets, many users were not aware of the existence and the impact of sandwich attacks. They also had a limited understanding of how to resolve the security issue. Interestingly, users showed high tolerance for the impact of sandwich attacks on individuals and the ecosystem, despite potential financial losses. We discuss general implications for users, DeFi applications, and the community.},

To prevent this attack on a PoS chain, we propose a protocol that checkpoints the state of the PoS chain to a proof-of-work blockchain such as Bitcoin. Our checkpointing protocol hence does not rely on any central authority. Our work uses Schnorr signatures and leverages Bitcoin recent Taproot upgrade, allowing us to create a checkpointing transaction of constant size.

Instead of matching the buy and sell sides, automated market makers (AMMs) employ a peer-to-pool method and determine asset price algorithmically through a so-called conservation function. To facilitate the improvement and development of AMM-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs), we create the first systematization of knowledge in this area. We first establish a general AMM framework describing the economics and formalizing the system’s state-space representation. We then employ our framework to systematically compare the top AMM protocols’ mechanics, illustrating their conservation functions, as well as slippage and divergence loss functions. We further discuss security and privacy concerns, how they are enabled by AMM-based DEXs’ inherent properties, and explore mitigating solutions. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive literature review on related work covering both DeFi and conventional market microstructure.},

We explore the general principles and procedures for interoperable blockchain systems to highlight their design commons. Then, we survey practical instances and compare state-of-the-art systems to present their unique features between distinct solutions.

abstract = {The ability to capture and quantify any aspect of daily life via sensors, enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT), data have become one of the most important resources of the 21st century. However, the high value of data also renders data an appealing target for criminals. Two key protection goals when dealing with data are therefore to maintain their permanent availability and to ensure their integrity. Blockchain technology provides a means of data protection that addresses both of these objectives. On that account, blockchains are becoming increasingly popular for the management of critical data. As blockchains are operated in a decentralized manner, they are not only protected against failures, but it is also ensured that neither party has sole control over the managed data. Furthermore, blockchains are immutable and tamper-proof data stores, whereby data integrity is guaranteed. While these properties are preferable from a data security perspective, they also pose a threat to privacy and confidentiality, as data cannot be concealed, rectified, or deleted once they are added to the blockchain.In this paper, we therefore investigate which features of the blockchain pose an inherent privacy threat when dealing with personal or confidential data. To this end, we consider to what extent blockchains are in compliance with applicable data protection laws, namely the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Based on our identified key issues, we assess which concepts and technical measures can be leveraged to address these issues in order to create a privacy-by-design blockchain system.},

abstract = {Blockchains are a specific type of distributed ledgers structured by a sequence of blocks of transactional data linked to each other. The use of blockchains has increased over time, and several new blockchains are emerging. It is therefore essential to enhance the interoperability between blockchain implementations to allow decentralised trading. One way to achieve this is with Cross-Chain Swap protocols. These protocols are critical systems as they handle assets. Therefore, it must be sure that the system does not contain errors. In this paper, we describe the Cross-Chain Swap problem in a formal way. We define safety and weak-liveness properties that guarantee no correct participant will be worse-off in an asynchronous system. Moreover, we provide a formally proved Byzantine fault-tolerant protocol that satisfies the swap specification. The protocol abstracts the blockchain enough to suit various distributed ledger frameworks aiming to perform a cross-chain swap. In addition, we illustrate how the described abstract protocol can be instantiated in a blockchain system.},

abstract = {The purpose of a reputation system is to hold the users of a distributed application accountable for their behavior. The reputation of a user is computed as an aggregate of the feedback provided by fellow users in the system. Truthful feedback is clearly a prerequisite for computing a reputation score that accurately represents the behavior of a user. However, it has been observed that users can hesitate in providing truthful feedback because, for example, of fear of retaliation. Privacy-preserving reputation systems enable users to provide feedback in a private and thus uninhibited manner. In this survey, we propose analysis frameworks for privacy-preserving reputation systems. We use these analysis frameworks to review and compare the existing approaches. Emphasis is placed on blockchain-based systems as they are a recent significant development in the area. Blockchain-based privacy-preserving reputation systems have properties, such as trustlessness, transparency, and immutability, which prior systems do not have. Our analysis provides several insights and directions for future research. These include leveraging blockchain to its full potential in order to develop truly trustless systems, to achieve some important security properties, and to include defenses against common attacks that have so far not been addressed by most current systems.},

abstract = {Block-STM is a parallel execution engine for smart contracts, built around the principles of Software Transactional Memory. Transactions are grouped in blocks, and every execution of the block must yield the same deterministic outcome. Block-STM further enforces that the outcome is consistent with executing transactions according to a preset order, leveraging this order to dynamically detect dependencies and avoid conflicts during speculative transaction execution. At the core of Block-STM is a novel, low-overhead collaborative scheduler of execution and validation tasks.Block-STM is implemented on the main branch of the Diem Blockchain code-base and runs in production at Aptos. Our evaluation demonstrates that Block-STM is adaptive to workloads with different conflict rates and utilizes the inherent parallelism therein. Block-STM achieves up to 110k tps in the Diem benchmarks and up to 170k tps in the Aptos Benchmarks, which is a 20x and 17x improvement over the sequential baseline with 32 threads, respectively. The throughput on a contended workload is up to 50k tps and 80k tps in Diem and Aptos benchmarks, respectively.},

abstract = {The recognition of capabilities supplied by cloud systems is presently growing up. Collecting or sharing healthcare data and sensitive information especially during Covid-19 pandemic has motivated organizations and enterprises to leverage the upsides coming from cloud-based applications. However, the privacy of electronic data in such applications remains a significant challenge for cloud vendors to adapt their solutions with existing privacy legislation standards such as general data protection regulation (GDPR). This paper, first, proposes a formal model and verification for data usage requests of providers in a cloud composite service using a model checking tool. A cloud pharmacy scenario is presented to illustrate the connectivity of providers in the composite service and the stream of their requests for both collection and movement of patient data. A set of verification is, then, undertaken over the pharmacy service in accordance with three significant GDPR obligations, namely user consent, data access and data transfer. Following that, the paper designs and implements a cloud container virtualization based on the verified formal model realising GDPR requirements. The container makes use of some enforcement smart contracts to only proceed the providers’ requests, which are compliant with GDPR. Finally, several experiments are provided to investigate the performance of our approach in terms of time, memory and cost.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem connects physical devices to the internet, offering significant advantages in agility, responsiveness, and potential environmental benefits. The number and variety of IoT devices are sharply increasing, and as they do, they generate significant data sources. Deep learning (DL) algorithms are increasingly integrated into IoT applications to learn and infer patterns and make intelligent decisions. However, current IoT paradigms rely on centralized storage and computing to operate the DL algorithms. This key central component can potentially cause issues in scalability, security threats, and privacy breaches. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a new paradigm for DL algorithms to preserve data privacy. Although FL helps reduce privacy leakage by avoiding transferring client data, it still has many challenges related to models’ vulnerabilities and attacks. With the emergence of blockchain and smart contracts, the utilization of these technologies has the potential to safeguard FL across IoT ecosystems. This study aims to review blockchain-based FL methods for securing IoT systems holistically. It presents the current state of research in blockchain, how it can be applied to FL approaches, current IoT security issues, and responses to outline the need to use emerging approaches toward the security and privacy of IoT ecosystems. It also focuses on IoT data analytics from a security perspective and the open research questions. It also provides a thorough literature review of blockchain-based FL approaches for IoT applications. Finally, the challenges and risks associated with integrating blockchain and FL in IoT are discussed to be considered in future works.},

The traditional contracts management methods have gradually revealed disadvantages such as contracts loss, delayed update, and data tampering. As a result, the ensuing retail contracts disputes have also become more and more frequently. In terms to handle with such issues, we proposed a blockchain-based electricity retail contracts system, which utilizes immutability and traceability of blockchain. Leveraging the immutability and traceability of blockchain, our system can effectively store retail contracts which alleviates the problem of existing contract disputes. Moreover, we combine Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) with blockchain to solve the storage problem. In addition, the data security of our system is guaranteed through the reasonable use of some means of authentication, digital signatures and access control.},

abstract = {AI applications find widespread use in a variety of domains. For further acceptance, mostly when multiple agents interact with the system, we must aim to preserve the privacy of participants information in such applications. Towards this, the Yao’s Millionaires’ problem (YMP), i.e., to determine the richer among two millionaires’ privately, finds relevance. This work presents a novel, practical, and verifiable solution to YMP, namely, Secure Comparison Protocol (SCP). We show that SCP achieves this comparison in a constant number of rounds, without using encryption and not requiring the participants’ continuous involvement. SCP uses semi-trusted third parties - which we refer to as privacy accountants - for the comparison, who do not learn any information about the values. That is, the probability of information leak is negligible in the problem size. In SCP, we also leverage the Ethereum network for pseudo-anonymous communication, unlike computationally expensive secure channels such as Tor. We present a Secure Truthful cOmbinatorial aUction Protocol (STOUP) for single-minded bidders to demonstrate SCP’s significance. We show that STOUP, unlike previous works, preserves the privacies relevant to an auction even from the auctioneer. We demonstrate the practicality of STOUP through simulations.},

abstract = {Data privacy and security preservation are essential issues in the public sector and, particularly, in the health and medical sectors. Patients often lose their data and medical history if they must move between hospitals. In these cases, other health care providers must repeat some procedures, such as analyses and x-rays. An approach that focuses on securely managing and sharing patient health records is thus required. As traditional centralised systems in hospitals do not meet the requirements for such an approach, this calls for the implementation of a secure structure that is capable of protecting patient data. One potential solution is the use of decentralised personal health records in a system that would allow the patient to own, manage and access their own data. This can be achieved by using the type of blockchain technology that would permit patients to identify shareable information and grant or prevent providers and other entities from accessing their data. Utilising the methodology of design science, this research will propose a solution for personal health records management by identifying the necessary requirements, and advantages and disadvantages of such a system. The study will propose a solution that will allow the patients to own, control, and benefit from their data.},

abstract = {Healthcare has undergone a rapid shift from traditional to smart health care system in recent times. The new paradigm takes a patient-centered approach and offers a variety of benefits to patients. Rapid technological developments have allowed for such a quick shift. The Internet of medical things (IoMT) is a key component of the development of smart health care systems. The current pandemic situation has demonstrated that IoMT systems can provide a quick patient diagnosis by continually monitoring their health and perhaps saving lives in the event of an emergency. But most IoMT devices were not built with security in mind, making them vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Furthermore, many gadgets such as smart sensors, wearable devices, handheld devices, and a variety of other heterogeneous devices being connected in a network for the smooth running of communication in healthcare make this system more vulnerable to security and privacy attacks. Security of IoMT devices and data is of paramount importance and critical to protecting the lives of patients. This survey attempts to explore applications of various recent technologies, particularly blockchain, PUFs, and AI/ML, in terms of security, privacy, protection, integrity, and authentication in IoMT ecosystem. In addition, insights into the benefits and limitations of existing security and privacy solutions have been provided.},

abstract = {DNS has often been criticized for inherent design flaws, which make the system vulnerable to attack. Further, domain names are not fully controlled by users, meaning that they can easily be taken down by authorities and registrars. Due to this, there have been efforts to build a decentralized name service that gives greater control to domain owners. The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a major example. Yet, no existing work has systematically studied this emerging system, particularly regarding security and misbehavior. To address this gap, we present the first large-scale measurement study of ENS. Our findings suggest that ENS has shown growth during its four years' evolution. We identify several security issues, including traditional name system problems, as well as new issues introduced by the unique properties of ENS. We find that attackers are abusing the system with thousands of squatting ENS names, a number of scam blockchain addresses and indexing of malicious websites. We further develop a new record persistence attack, to find that 22,716 .eth names (3.7% of all names) are vulnerable to name hijacking. Our exploration suggests that our community should invest more effort into the detection and mitigation of issues in decentralized name services.},

abstract = {The rapid evolution of technology has massively changed and shaped audit work culture. At the same time, the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak significantly changed audit and control activities, encouraging auditors to audit clients remotely and forcing auditors to adopt advanced digital technology, especially blockchain-based technology. Blockchain is one decentralized, transparent, and immutable technology that plays an essential role and has an aggressive impact in the audit field. The implementation and adoption of cognitive technologies such as blockchain in the remote audit process allow auditors to access various client data and information in real-time, ensure audit data integrity, review and process data documentation quickly, obtaining data directly without third parties that make it easier for auditors to obtain audit evidence instantly and accurately in detecting any anomalies. This research aims to identify and navigate how blockchain assists auditors in performing remote audits, ensuring data integrity, detecting fraudulent financial reporting, elaborating on factors that influence the auditor's success in using blockchain, and identifying challenges auditors face during blockchain utilization in their remote audits. This research used a descriptive qualitative approach by obtaining primary data from profound interview results with several auditors experienced in using blockchain. We also used secondary data from journals, papers, articles, books, and relevant websites. The research findings showed that blockchain's unique characteristics greatly assist auditors in conducting remote audits, ensuring audit data integrity, and detecting fraudulent financial reporting in various ways. Furthermore, various factors influence blockchain utilization, such as human resources aspects, the effectiveness of the IT control environment, and the CPA size firm. Lastly, auditors should face several challenges in the present and future.},

All these three technologies are working together as one part of a multi-layer security and management system, as well as, it improves the security of the bank. In order to analyze the implementation of these systems, each of the architectures is defined separately with comparison-based evaluation to derive the fact how these technologies within our system architecture works efficiently.},

abstract = {Blockchain has been widely deployed in various fields, such as finance, education, and public services. Blockchain has decentralized mechanisms with persistency and auditability and runs as an immutable distributed ledger, where transactions are jointly performed through cryptocurrency-based consensus algorithms by worldwide distributed nodes. There have been many survey papers reviewing the blockchain technologies from different perspectives, e.g., digital currencies, consensus algorithms, and smart contracts. However, none of them have focused on the blockchain data management systems. To fill in this gap, we have conducted a comprehensive survey on the data management systems, based on three typical types of blockchain, i.e., standard blockchain, hybrid blockchain, and DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)-based blockchain. We categorize their data management mechanisms into three layers: blockchain architecture, blockchain data structure, and blockchain storage engine, where block architecture indicates how to record transactions on a distributed ledger, blockchain data structure refers to the internal structure of each block, and blockchain storage engine specifies the storage form of data on the blockchain system. For each layer, the works advancing the state-of-the-art are discussed together with technical challenges. Furthermore, we lay out several possible future research directions for the blockchain data management systems.},

abstract = {The labeling of electricity is considered an important mechanism to differentiate renewable power generation and, thus, to incentivize the expansion of green energy. However, today's systems for documenting and trading green energy certificates suffer from multiple challenges. These could be addressed by a digital solution that holistically collects and processes production and consumption data. Blockchain-based architectures have repeatedly been suggested for this purpose since they can provide transparency and can likely be accepted by a broad group of stakeholders. Yet, there are significant scalability and privacy issues of a blockchain-based approach for storing and processing fine-grained production and consumption data. In this paper, we propose and discuss a potential solution that levers succinct cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to balance the required level of transparency and privacy while at the same time providing a high degree of scalability.},

abstract = {Recent initiatives related to the Metaverse focus on better visualisation, like augmented or virtual reality, but also persistent digital objects. To guarantee real ownership of these digital objects, open systems based on public blockchains and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are emerging together with a nascent decentralized and open creator economy. To manage this emerging economy in a more organised way, and fight the so common NFT plagiarism, we propose CopyrightLY, a decentralized application for authorship and copyright management. It provides means to claim content authorship, including supporting evidence. Content and metadata are stored in decentralized storage and registered on the blockchain. A token is used to curate these claims, and potential complaints, by staking it on them. Staking is incentivized by the fact that the token is minted using a bonding curve. The tokenomics include the resolution of complaints and enabling the monetization of curated claims. Monetization is achieved through licensing NFTs with metadata enhanced by semantic technologies. Semantic data makes explicit the reuse conditions transferred with the token while keeping the connection to the underlying copyright claims to improve the trustability of the NFTs. Moreover, the semantic metadata is flexible enough to enable licensing not just in the real world. Licenses can refer to reuses in specific locations in a metaverse, thus facilitating the emergence of creative economies in them.},

abstract = {Blockchain is a disruptive technology intended to implement secure decentralised distributed systems, in which transactional data can be shared, stored, and verified by participants of the system without needing a central authentication/verification authority. Blockchain-based systems have several architectural components and variants, which architects can leverage to build secure software systems. However, there is a lack of studies to assist architects in making architecture design and configuration decisions for blockchain-based systems. This knowledge gap may increase the chance of making unsuitable design decisions and producing configurations prone to potential security risks. To address this limitation, we report our comprehensive systematic literature review to derive a taxonomy of commonly used architecture design decisions in blockchain-based systems. We map each of these decisions to potential security attacks and their posed threats. MITRE’s attack tactic categories and Microsoft STRIDE threat modeling are used to systematically classify threats and their associated attacks to identify potential attacks and threats in blockchain-based systems. Our mapping approach aims to guide architects to make justifiable design decisions that will result in more secure implementations.},

abstract = {As smart contracts gain adoption in financial transactions, it becomes increasingly important to ensure that they are free of bugs and security vulnerabilities. Of particular relevance in this context are arithmetic overflow bugs, as integers are often used to represent financial assets like account balances. Motivated by this observation, this paper presents SolType, a refinement type system for Solidity that can be used to prevent arithmetic over- and under-flows in smart contracts. SolType allows developers to add refinement type annotations and uses them to prove that arithmetic operations do not lead to over- and under-flows. SolType incorporates a rich vocabulary of refinement terms that allow expressing relationships between integer values and aggregate properties of complex data structures. Furthermore, our implementation, called Solid, incorporates a type inference engine and can automatically infer useful type annotations, including non-trivial contract invariants. To evaluate the usefulness of our type system, we use Solid to prove arithmetic safety of a total of 120 smart contracts. When used in its fully automated mode (i.e., using Solid's type inference capabilities), Solid is able to eliminate 86.3% of redundant runtime checks used to guard against overflows. We also compare Solid against a state-of-the-art arithmetic safety verifier called VeriSmart and show that Solid has a significantly lower false positive rate, while being significantly faster in terms of verification time.},

abstract = {The rise of Ethereum has lead to a flourishing decentralized marketplace that has, unfortunately, fallen victim to frontrunning and Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) activities, where savvy participants game transaction orderings within a block for profit. One popular solution to address such behavior is Flashbots, a private pool with infrastructure and design goals aimed at eliminating the negative externalities associated with MEV. While Flashbots has established laudable goals to address MEV behavior, no evidence has been provided to show that these goals are achieved in practice.In this paper, we measure the popularity of Flashbots and evaluate if it is meeting its chartered goals. We find that (1) Flashbots miners account for over 99.9% of the hashing power in the Ethereum network, (2) powerful miners are making more than 2X what they were making prior to using Flashbots, while non-miners' slice of the pie has shrunk commensurately, (3) mining is just as centralized as it was prior to Flashbots with more than 90% of Flashbots blocks coming from just two miners, and (4) while more than 80% of MEV extraction in Ethereum is happening through Flashbots, 13.2% is coming from other private pools.},

abstract = {With the recent proliferation of blockchains, identifying security risks to them has become an important issue. Among the various types of cyberattacks against blockchains, the blockchain poisoning attack involves the storing of malicious data in the blockchain to compromise it. One scenario is an attack that distributes forgeries of digital content traded and managed using Non-Fungible Token (NFT) on the blockchain. Currently, concomitant with the growing interest in NFT-based content trading, blockchain poisoning attacks on NFT trading and their effects have also increased. In this study, we examined the issues that may lead to attacks in the process from generation to distribution of digital content using NFT from the viewpoint of flexibility and interoperability of the content. Consequently, we discovered that there are two types of attack risks in NFT trading using malicious content: fake attacks and reuse attacks. As a countermeasure against these attacks, we propose a method for verifying the authenticity of the content itself using a decentralized scheme. The proposed method ensures the confidentiality of contents by using deep learning as an irreversible transformation operation in the distributed scheme and for privacy protection.},

The goal is to look at the current state of blockchain based IoT systems and applications and to demonstrate how special qualities of this technology can transform the working methods in the industry. We analysed high-quality papers published in high-ranking scientific journals over the last years to write this paper. This work presents a comprehensive classification of IoT and Blockchain enabled applications across many sectors such as Agriculture, Business, Supply Chain, Data Management, Finance, Healthcare, IoT, and&nbsp;Privacy, and in the end, we have added recent trends, emerging areas, and open challenges, for future research across various sectors and industries, based on a structured, systematic review and thematic content analysis of the discovered literature.

We find that users receive more rewards tend to take positive actions towards the community. We summarize several arbitrage patterns and confirm the current detection is not sufficient in screening out airdrop hunters. In conjunction with the results, we discuss from the aspects of interaction, financialization, and system design to conclude the challenges and possible research directions for decentralized communities.},

The purpose of this paper is to ensure the storage security and efficient use of industrial production data. We improve the existing Industrial Internet of Things architecture and add blockchain to participate in smart factory privacy protection and data automation processing.

abstract = {This paper presents experience feedback on how we managed to formally verify properties on semi-formal models of a Life Cycle Management System (LCMS) for smart devices. These devices are typically structured around a System on Chip (SoC), which can provide built-in hardware security. They can offer the possibility to make the deployment of Product-Service Systems (PSSs) to consumers easier, through traceability and collaborative consumption rule enforcement. A PSS is a business model in which products and services are tightly connected. One of the main advantages of such a PSS is that it optimizes product use, with a positive environmental impact. Associating the LCMS with a blockchain-based protocol makes it possible to avoid centralization. Semi-formal UML models of such a LCMS, as well as the informal properties it must comply with, were defined in order to explore its design space and evaluate the outcomes of specific design choices. However, the security of the LCMS implementation must be guaranteed, including protocols and architecture. For that purpose, these models and properties were later improved to be formally verifiable, which ensures the security of their implementation at the expense of added complexity. The verification was carried out using two available software tools: VerifPal for the protocol model, and AnimUML (developed by one of the authors) for the architecture model. This makes the procedure accessible for non-specialists in formal verification. Finally, our feedback on the whole process as well as on VerifPal is also provided.},

The resulting global financial infrastructure however incurs latency and costs that are prohibitive for many economics applications that are local to a region or a community. Local economics relies on trust and reputation through repeated interactions within a community of participants that know each other, which has not previously been leveraged for the design of crypto-tokens. In this paper, we formulate the design of new local crypto-tokens as a research problem: we present concrete application examples, we identify double-spending detection as a weaker and sufficient alternative to double-spending prevention in local applications, and we formulate desired properties of new local crypto-tokens designs. Based on our analysis, we envision local crypto-tokens to complement existing blockchain projects by facilitating intra-community economics at much lower latency and costs, while evolutions of current blockchain projects will provide global inter-community exchanges of high-value transactions.},

abstract = {The spread of deceptive or misleading information, commonly referred to as misinformation, poses a social, economic, and political threat. Such deceptive information spreads quickly and inexpensively. For example, with the hype around blockchain technologies, misinformation on “get rich quick” scams on the Web is rampant, as evidenced by sophisticated Twitter hacks of celebrities and many social media posts that bait unsuspecting users to visit phishing websites. Unfortunately, AI technologies have contributed to the growing pains of misinformation on the Web, with the advances in technologies such as generative adversarial deep learning techniques that can generate “deep fakes” for nefarious purposes. At the same time, researchers are working on a different set of AI technologies to combat misinformation, akin to “fighting fire with fire.” As there is no clear way to win the online “cat-and-mouse” game against fake news generators and spreaders of misinformation, we believe social media platforms could be fortified with blockchain and AI technologies to mitigate the extent of misinformation propagation in various communities worldwide. Tamper-proof blockchain techniques can provide irrefutable evidence of what content is authentic, guaranteeing how the information has evolved with provenance trails. Various AI models that could be used for detecting fake news can be served on a blockchain for the effective and transparent utility of the model. Such a synergistic combination of AI and blockchain is a burgeoning area of research. This paper outlines a proposal for combining blockchain and AI techniques for handling misinformation on the Web and highlights some of the early ongoing work in this space.},

abstract = {The development of technology has been growing rapidly in the current state of time. With that being said, blockchain is one of the important pillars that is currently revolutionizing the traditional way of life. It is a new system that brings not only more efficiency, but also more challenges to be faced as well to many fields, including accounting and audit as one of them. Our research is going to discuss how blockchain is going to create multiple breakthroughs in accounting and audit field, bringing not only potential benefits and efficiencies, but also new challenges that must be addressed, including how cryptocurrency is handled in terms of accounting and audit, as it is recognized as one of the most popular uses of blockchain technology worldwide. The selection of Big 4 CPA firms is based on the evidence shown by those leading accounting firms in terms of adopting blockchain technology in their way of work and how they approach the technology innovation. This is shown by their interest on the matter which is published on their own respective websites. Our research used a descriptive qualitative approach, obtaining secondary data from papers, journals, books, and relevant websites.},

abstract = {Industrial processes rely on sensory data for decision-making processes, risk assessment, and performance evaluation. Extracting actionable insights from the collected data calls for an infrastructure that can ensure the dissemination of trustworthy data. For the physical data to be trustworthy, it needs to be cross validated through multiple sensor sources with overlapping fields of view. Cross-validated data can then be stored on the blockchain, to maintain its integrity and trustworthiness. Once trustworthy data is recorded on the blockchain, product lifecycle events can be fed into data-driven systems for process monitoring, diagnostics, and optimized control. In this regard, digital twins (DTs) can be leveraged to draw intelligent conclusions from data by identifying the faults and recommending precautionary measures ahead of critical events. Empowering DTs with blockchain in industrial use cases targets key challenges of disparate data repositories, untrustworthy data dissemination, and the need for predictive maintenance. In this survey, while highlighting the key benefits of using blockchain-based DTs, we present a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art research results for blockchain-based DTs. Based on the current research trends, we discuss a trustworthy blockchain-based DTs framework. We also highlight the role of artificial intelligence in blockchain-based DTs. Furthermore, we discuss the current and future research and deployment challenges of blockchain-supported DTs that require further investigation.},

abstract = {Modern computer systems tend to rely on large trusted computing bases (TCBs) for operations. To address the TCB bloating problem, hardware vendors have developed mechanisms to enable or facilitate the creation of a trusted execution environment (TEE) in which critical software applications can execute securely in an isolated environment. Even under the circumstance that a host OS is compromised by an adversary, key security properties such as confidentiality and integrity of the software inside the TEEs can be guaranteed. The promise of integrity and security has driven developers to adopt it for use cases involving access control, PKS, IoT among other things. Among these applications include blockchain-related use cases. The usage of the TEEs doesn’t come without its own implementation challenges and potential pitfalls. In this paper, we examine the assumptions, security models, and operational environments of the proposed TEE use cases of blockchain-based applications. The exercise and analysis help the hardware TEE research community to identify some open challenges and opportunities for research and rethink the design of hardware TEEs in general.},

abstract = {Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are unique digital identifiers used to represent ownership of various cryptoassets such as music, artwork, collectibles, game assets and allow for an unalterable and provable chain of creation and ownership. The market for NFTs exploded in 2021, and much of the public is being exposed to this new digital ownership medium for the first time. While uptake of this new medium is relatively slow, we feel the prospects of blockchain technology are up-and-coming. NFTs are still largely misunderstood by the wider community, and as such, this provides a fascinating opportunity to explore the NFT marketplace in greater depth. We analyzed sales data from OpenSea - the NFT marketplace with the most extensive user base and sales volume. Our study considered 5.25 million sales that occurred between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2021. We first lead by presenting an overview of our data collection process and summarizing key statistics of the data set. We examine user behaviour in the market to show that a small subset of heavy-hitters is driving massive growth. Secondly, we review the economic activity within the network to show how these power users drive extreme price volatility within the Art and Collectible categories. Lastly, we review the network of buyers and sellers to show that despite the sparsity that exists in the network, communities of users are forming, and most power users tend to congregate in these structures. These findings shed light on areas of the NFT marketplace that have been relatively unexamined and provide a multi-level analysis of a multi-billion dollar market.},

abstract = {The rapid development of blockchain and cryptocurrency in the past decade has created a huge demand for digital trading platforms. Popular decentralised exchanges (DEXs) such as Uniswap and PancakeSwap were created to address this market gap, facilitating cryptocurrency exchange without intermediaries and hence eliminating security and privacy issues associated with traditional centralised platforms. This, however, due to lack of regulation, results in the emergence of a host of damaging investment fraudulent schemes, including Ponzi, honey pot, pump-and-dump, and rug-pull.In this study, we aim to investigate the problem of detecting rug-pull on Uniswap using supervised learning. We aggregate a list of 23 features and propose the use of a hybrid feature selection technique to find the most relevant features for rug-pull. The classifier, using this refined set of features, outperforms the classifier in the previous studies and achieves an f1-score of 99%, a precision of 97% on non-malicious tokens, and a recall of 99% on malicious tokens. Additionally, we show that the XGBoost classifier, built using these proposed features, can distinguish scam tokens and newly listed tokens, which are often harder to differentiate as they have similar characteristics, and also propose a validation method.},

abstract = {Blockchain is a distributed ledger technique that guarantees the traceability of transactions. Blockchain is adopted in multiple domains like finance (e.g., cryptocurrency), healthcare, security, and supply chain. In the open-source software (OSS) portal GitHub, we observe a growing adoption of Blockchain-based solutions. Given the rapid emergence of Blockchain-based solutions in our daily life and the evolving cryptocurrency market, it is important to know the status quo, how developers generally interact in those repos, and how much freedom they have in applying code changes. We report an empirical study of 3,664 Blockchain software repositories from GitHub. We divide the Blockchain repositories into two categories: Tool (e.g., SDKs) and Applications (e.g., service/solutions developed using SDKs). The Application category is further divided into two sub-categories: Crypto and Non-Crypto applications. In all Blockchain repository categories, the contribution interactions on commits are the most common interaction type. We found that more organizations contributing to the Blockchain repos than individual users. The median numbers of internal and external users in tools are higher than the application repos. We observed a higher degree of collaboration (e.g., for maintenance efforts) among users in Blockchain tools than those in the application repos. Among the artifacts, issues have a greater number of interactions than commits and pull requests. Related to autonomy we found that less than half of total project contributions are autonomous. Our findings offer implications to Blockchain stakeholders, like developers to stay aware of OSS practices around Blockchain software.},

abstract = {Developing a bug-free compiler is difficult; modern optimizing compilers are among the most complex software systems humans build. Fuzzing is one way to identify subtle compiler bugs that are hard to find with human-constructed tests. Grammar-based fuzzing, however, requires a grammar for a compiler’s input language, and can miss bugs induced by code that does not actually satisfy the grammar the compiler should accept. Grammar-based fuzzing also seldom uses advanced modern fuzzing techniques based on coverage feedback. However, modern mutation-based fuzzers are often ineffective for testing compilers because most inputs they generate do not even come close to getting past the parsing stage of compilation. This paper introduces a technique for taking a modern mutation-based fuzzer (AFL in our case, but the method is general) and augmenting it with operators taken from mutation testing, and program splicing. We conduct a controlled study to show that our hybrid approaches significantly improve fuzzing effectiveness qualitatively (consistently finding unique bugs that baseline approaches do not) and quantitatively (typically finding more unique bugs in the same time span, despite fewer program executions). Our easy-to-apply approach has allowed us to report more than 100 confirmed and fixed bugs in production compilers, and found a bug in the Solidity compiler that earned a security bounty.},

abstract = {The advent of Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) has enabled the feasibility of wireless sensor networks for environmental traffic sensing across urban areas. In this study, we explore the usage of LoRaWAN end nodes as traffic sensing sensors to offer a practical traffic management solution. The monitored Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) factor is reported and used in the gateways to assess the traffic of the environment. Our technique utilizes LoRaWAN as a long-range communication technology to provide a large-scale system. In this work, we present a method of using LoRaWAN devices to estimate traffic flows. LoRaWAN end devices then transmit their packets to different gateways. Their RSSI will be affected by the number of cars present on the roadway. We used SVM and clustering methods to classify the approximate number of cars present. This paper details our experiences with the design and real implementation of this system across an area that stretches for miles in urban scenarios. We continuously measured and reported RSSI at different gateways for weeks. Results have shown that if a LoRaWAN end node is placed in an optimal position, up to 96% of correct environment traffic level detection can be obtained. Additionally, we share the lessons learned from such a deployment for traffic sensing.},

abstract = {As blockchain-based commercial projects and startups flourish, efficiency becomes one of the critical metrics in designing blockchain systems. Due to its high efficiency, Proof of Authority (PoA) Aura has become one of the most widely adopted consensus solutions for blockchains. Our research finds over 4,000 projects have used Aura and its variants. In this paper, we provide a rigorous analysis of Aura. We propose three types of time-manipulation attacks, where a malicious leader simply needs to modify the timestamp in its proposed block or delay it to extract extra benefits. These attacks can easily break the legal leader election, thus directly harming the fairness of the block proposal. We apply our attacks to a mature Aura project called OpenEthereum. By repeatedly conducting our attacks1 over 15 days, we find that an adversary can gain on average 200% mining rewards of their fair shares. Furthermore, such attacks can even indirectly break the finality of blocks and the safety of the system. Based on the deployment of Aura as of September 2022, the potentially affected market cap is up to 2.13 billion USD. As a by-product, we further discuss solutions to mitigate such issues and report our observations to official teams.},

abstract = {The use of blockchain in regulatory ecosystems is a promising approach to address challenges of compliance among mutually untrusted entities. In this work, we consider applications of blockchain technologies in telecom regulations. In particular, we address growing concerns around Unsolicited Commercial Communication (UCC aka. spam) sent through text messages (SMS) and phone calls in India. Despite several regulatory measures taken to curb the menace of spam it continues to be a nuisance to subscribers while posing challenges to telecom operators and regulators alike. In this paper, we present a consortium blockchain based architecture to address the problem of UCC in India. Our solution improves subscriber experiences, improves the efficiency of regulatory processes while also positively impacting all stakeholders in the telecom ecosystem. Unlike previous approaches to the problem of UCC, which are all ex-post, our approach to adherence to the regulations is ex-ante. The proposal described in this paper is a primary contributor to the revision of regulations concerning UCC and spam by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). The new regulations published in July 2018 were first of a kind in the world and amended the 2010 Telecom Commercial Communication Customer Preference Regulation (TCCCPR), through mandating the use of a blockchain/distributed ledgers in addressing the UCC problem. In this paper, we provide a holistic account of of the projects’ evolution from (1) its design and strategy, to (2) regulatory and policy action, (3) country wide implementation and deployment, and (4) evaluation and impact of the work. While the scope of the work presented in this paper is in the context of the UCC problem in India, we believe that the approach can be generalized to adopt blockchain based solutions to improve regulatory processes in other contexts and countries. We hope this account will serve as a useful case study for the stakeholders of the telecommunications ecosystem and regulators, and motivate countries across the world facing similar challenges to consider the viability of the technology, be convinced to establish it, continue efforts at addressing active research challenges, and scale the technology from our experiences.},

The combination of blockchain and federated learning is becoming a hot topic of research. The general architecture for blockchain-based federated learning is to replace the central server with the blockchain with a single committee directly. However, the absence of partial nodes in the committee will make the distribution of samples uneven. In this paper, we introduce a blockchain-based decentralized federated learning Framework(BFLDC), and BFLDC creatively introduces the dual-committees. Different from the single committee, our dual-committees can guarantee to choose the good nodes and the others to construct the committee, which can make more nodes into the committee, as well as prevent the training process from the attack of the malicious nodes. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed framework can achieve the preset goals.},

abstract = {Players in the building and construction industry have progressively adopted building Information Modelling (BIM) to improve the efficiency of building information management through its rich digital building models used at all building life cycle stages. However, there are still several constraints in the BIM collaboration process and data management regarding data security, accountability, and transparency. On the other hand, blockchain, a distributed ledger technology, is considered a solution to address those constraints. Therefore, this paper aims to integrate blockchain technology into the BIM workflow, focusing on the smart building planning process that holds most data generation of the activities in the whole construction project. To obtain the objectives of this study, literature review, benchmarking study, and expert interviews were conducted in two stages, firstly to identify the characteristics and components of a smart building and then to develop further the blockchain-based framework for smart building planning in the BIM model. By developing the framework that utilizes Ethereum blockchain and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) peer-to-peer storage in Revit BIM client, the results of this study showed that the integration of blockchain in BIM workflow provides an improved platform in terms of data security, accountability, transparency, in which digital signature can be created, and authorization for the models is provided for the planning process of a smart building.},

abstract = {Centralized networks inevitably exhibit single points of failure that malicious actors regularly target. Decentralized networks are more resilient if numerous participants contribute to the network’s functionality. Most decentralized networks employ incentive mechanisms to coordinate the participation and cooperation of peers and thereby ensure the functionality and security of the network. This article systematically reviews incentive mechanisms for decentralized networks and networked systems by covering 165 prior literature reviews and 178 primary research papers published between 1993 and October 2022. Of the considered sources, we analyze eleven literature reviews and 105 primary research papers in detail by categorizing and comparing the distinctive properties of the presented incentive mechanisms. The reviewed incentive mechanisms establish fairness and reward participation and cooperative behavior. We review work that substitutes central authority through independent and subjective mechanisms run in isolation at each participating peer and work that applies multiparty computation. We use monetary, reputation, and service rewards as categories to differentiate the implementations and evaluate each incentive mechanism’s data management, attack resistance, and contribution model. Further, we highlight research gaps and deficiencies in reproducibility and comparability. Finally, we summarize our assessments and provide recommendations to apply incentive mechanisms to decentralized networks that share computational resources.},

abstract = {Blockchain databases have attracted widespread attention but suffer from poor scalability due to underlying non-scalable blockchains. While blockchain sharding is necessary for a scalable blockchain database, it poses a new challenge named on-chain cross-shard database services. Each cross-shard database service (e.g., cross-shard queries or inter-shard load balancing) involves massive cross-shard data exchanges, while the existing cross-shard mechanisms need to process each cross-shard data exchange via the consensus of all nodes in the related shards (i.e., on-chain) to resist a Byzantine environment of blockchain, which eliminates sharding benefits.To tackle the challenge, this paper presents GriDB, the first scalable blockchain database, by designing a novel off-chain cross-shard mechanism for efficient cross-shard database services. Borrowing the idea of off-chain payments, GriDB delegates massive cross-shard data exchange to a few nodes, each of which is randomly picked from a different shard. Considering the Byzantine environment, the untrusted delegates cooperate to generate succinct proof for cross-shard data exchanges, while the consensus is only responsible for the low-cost proof verification. However, different from payments, the database services' verification has more requirements (e.g., completeness, correctness, freshness, and availability); thus, we introduce several new authenticated data structures (ADS). Particularly, we utilize consensus to extend the threat model and reduce the complexity of traditional accumulator-based ADS for verifiable cross-shard queries with a rich set of relational operators. Moreover, we study the necessity of inter-shard load balancing for a scalable blockchain database and design an off-chain and live approach for both efficiency and availability during balancing. An evaluation of our prototype shows the performance of GriDB in terms of scalability in workloads with queries and updates.},

abstract = {Ensuring determinism is mandatory when writing blockchain software. When determinism is not met it can lead to serious implications in the blockchain network while compromising the software development, release, and patching processes. In the industrial context, it is widespread to adopt general-purpose languages, such as Go, for developing blockchain solutions. However, it is not surprising that non-deterministic behaviors may arise, being these programming languages not originally designed for blockchain purposes. In this paper, we present an experience report on ensuring determinism in blockchain software with GoLiSA, a static analyzer based on abstract interpretation for Go applications, in an industrial context. In particular, we ran GoLiSA on Commercio.network, a blockchain-based solution for exchanging electronic documents in a legally binding way. Thanks to GoLiSA, non-trivial bugs got detected and the analysis performed made it possible to identify the critical points where to apply the fixes.},

abstract = {Public cloud platforms have leveraged Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) technology to provide confidential computing services. However, TEE-protected applications still suffer from rollback or forking attacks, in which their states could be rolled back to a stale version or be forked into multiple versions, resulting in state continuity violations. Existing solutions against these attacks either rely on weak threat models based on centralized trust (e.g., trusted server) or suffer from large performance overheads (e.g., tens of state updates per second). In this paper, we propose Narrator, a secure and practical system, (1) that relies on a blockchain (i.e., decentralized trust) and TEEs, and (2) that provides high-performance state continuity protection like unlimited and fast state updates for applications in cloud TEEs. The intuition behind our design is simple. Our design uses the blockchain to initialize a distributed system of TEEs, laying down the decentralized trust base with a small interaction overhead, while the distributed system provides performant state continuity protection. Our distributed system adopts a customized version of the consistent broadcast protocol and leverages advanced techniques to make state updates processed with one round trip delay on average. We build a proof-of-concept of Narrator on Intel SGX (i.e., a representative design of TEEs) and do extensive experiments to evaluate its performance. Our evaluation results show that in a LAN environment with 5 nodes, Narrator can support about 6k state updates per second, meanwhile keeping the latency as low as 3-8 ms. The throughput is 30x larger than that in ROTE and 70x larger than using a TPM counter.},

abstract = {The beginning of 2020 is associated with the emergence and spread of the COVID-19 disease. The characteristics of this virus, such as high transmission power and lack of definitive treatment have caused problems in all aspects of organizational economics. Restrictions that were imposed to deal with the virus affected the global economy. Fear of being exposed to the virus, quarantine and lockdown led to a massive increase in online shopping. However, people’s concern about the health and authenticity of the products offered online and their incompatibility with consumer standards raised concerns about the reliability of the existing e-commerce models. Fraud, counterfeit products, ethical sourcing and product safety are some of the concerns that affected online business acceptance. To address these challenges, we examine the use of a blockchain-based e-commerce approach to guarantee authenticity through blockchains trace and trace capabilities. In this approach, we evaluate the profit gains achieved through addressing consumer concerns on safety and authenticity. To examine these benefits, we use a game theory leader-follower approach. We evaluate the profitability of e-commerce in three scenarios, including when non of seller and e-commerce website use blockchain, only when the seller uses the blockchain and when both the seller and the e-commerce websites use blockchain. The evaluation results show that the situation in which both the seller and the website use blockchain has the highest profitability for the seller due to the maximum reduction of customer concerns.},

Registries must be audited to ensure global invariants are preserved, which, in turn, allows for efficient monitoring of individual registry entries by their owners. To this end, existing proposals either assume trusted third-party auditors or rely on incrementally verifiable computation (IVC) via expensive recursive SNARKs to make registries client-auditable.In this work, we give new client-auditable verifiable registries with throughputs up to 100x greater than baseline IVC solutions. Our approach relies on an authenticated dictionary based on RSA accumulators for which we develop a new constant-size invariant proof. We use this as a replacement for Merkle trees to optimize the baseline IVC approach, but also provide a novel construction which dispenses with SNARKs entirely. This latter solution adopts a new checkpointing method to ensure client view consistency.},

abstract = {Fuzz testing (fuzzing) has witnessed its prosperity in detecting security flaws recently. It generates a large number of test cases and monitors the executions for defects. Fuzzing has detected thousands of bugs and vulnerabilities in various applications. Although effective, there lacks systematic analysis of gaps faced by fuzzing. As a technique of defect detection, fuzzing is required to narrow down the gaps between the entire input space and the defect space. Without limitation on the generated inputs, the input space is infinite. However, defects are sparse in an application, which indicates that the defect space is much smaller than the entire input space. Besides, because fuzzing generates numerous test cases to repeatedly examine targets, it requires fuzzing to perform in an automatic manner. Due to the complexity of applications and defects, it is challenging to automatize the execution of diverse applications. In this article, we systematically review and analyze the gaps as well as their solutions, considering both breadth and depth. This survey can be a roadmap for both beginners and advanced developers to better understand fuzzing.},

We report our experience from modelling a blockchain-enhanced seafood supply chain using ArchiMate motivation and strategy models, where stakeholders have diverse concerns and goals. Preliminary results have indicated that such a modelling approach facilitates the common understanding, and the decision and prioritisation of the business strategies, as well as the identification of the blockchain benefits for the enterprises. It may help stakeholders along the value chain to align their business strategies and priorities, and can be an effective tool for value co-creation and enhancing the collaboration and communication among stakeholders and with blockchain application developers.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of embedded smart devices, a new data collection paradigm, mobile crowd-sensing (MCS), has been proposed. MCS allows individuals from the crowd to act as sensors and contribute their observation data. However, existing MCS systems are mostly based on third-party platforms, and there is no guarantee that a center is completely credible. In addition, security and privacy issues should not be ignored. During MCS’ execution, the participants’ various information and truth value are usually exposed, and the computation related to data privacy cannot be verified. In this paper, we integrate the blockchain into the MCS scenario to design a blockchain based privacy-preserving quality control mechanism, which prevents data from being tampered with, and denied, ensuring that the reward is distributed fairly. In the new system, we propose a privacy preserving participant selection scheme and the result can be verified (i.e., security against malicious node) without any third-party arbiter. Finally, considering the issues with sensing data privacy and efficiency in the truth discovery process, we propose a new privacy-aware crowdsensing design with iterative truth discovery based on rational secure multi-party computation. The experimental results show that compared to the prior result, the proposed solutions are highly practical and facilitate quality control without violating the participant’s privacy.},

The critical civil and military domains include, but are not limited to, battlefield, healthcare, transportation, and rescue missions. Given the sensitive nature and modernization of tactical domains, the security of C3I systems has recently become a critical concern. This is because cyber-attacks on C3I systems have catastrophic consequences including loss of human lives. Despite the increasing number of cyber-attacks on C3I systems and growing concerns about C3I systems’ security, there is a paucity of a comprehensive review to systematize the body of knowledge on the security of C3I systems. Therefore, in this article, we have gathered, analyzed, and synthesized the body of knowledge on the security of C3I systems. We have identified and reported security vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and countermeasures/defenses for C3I systems. In particular, this article has enabled us to (i) propose a taxonomy for security vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and countermeasures; (ii) interrelate attack vectors with security vulnerabilities and countermeasures; and (iii) propose future research directions for advancing the state-of-the-art on the security of C3I systems. We believe that our findings will serve as a guideline for practitioners and researchers to advance the state-of-the-practice and state-of-the-art on the security of C3I systems.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of blockchain, the concept of decentralized applications (DApps), built upon smart contracts, has attracted much attention in academia and industry. However, significant issues w.r.t. system throughput, transaction confidentiality, and the security guarantee of the DApp transaction execution and order correctness hinder the border adoption of blockchain DApps.To address these issues, we propose L2chain, a novel blockchain framework aiming to scale the system through a layer-2 network where DApps process transactions in the layer-2 network and only the system state digest, acting as the state integrity proof, is maintained on-chain. To achieve high performance, we introduce the split-execute-merge (SEM) transaction processing workflow with the help of the RSA accumulator, allowing DApps to lock and update a part of the state digest in parallel. We also design a witness cache mechanism for DApp executors to reduce the transaction processing latency. To fulfill confidentiality, we leverage the trusted execution environment (TEE) for DApps to execute encrypted transactions off-chain. To ensure transaction execution and order correctness, we propose a two-step execution process for DApps to prevent attacks (i.e., rollback attacks) from subverting the state transition. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that L2chain can achieve 1.5X to 42.2X and 7.1X to 8.9X throughput improvements in permissioned and permissionless settings respectively.},

Fitness wearables devices record a considerable amount of sensitive and private details about exercise, blood oxygen level, and heart rate. Privacy concerns have emerged about the interactions between an individual’s raw fitness data and data analysis by the providers of fitness apps and wearable devices. This paper describes the importance of adopting and applying legal frameworks within the fitness tracker ecosystem. In this review, we describe the studies on the current privacy policies of fitness app providers, heuristically evaluate the methods for consent management by fitness providers, summarize the gaps identified in our review of these studies, and discuss potential solutions for filling the gaps identified. We have identified four main problems related to preserving the privacy of users of fitness apps: lack of system transparency, lack of privacy policy legibility, concerns regarding one-time consent, and issues of noncompliance regarding consent management. After discussing feasible solutions, we conclude by describing how blockchain is suitable for solving these privacy issues.},

abstract = {NFT or Non-Fungible Token is a token that certifies a digital asset to be unique. A wide range of assets including, digital art, music, tweets, memes, are being sold as NFTs. NFT-related content has been widely shared on social media sites such as Twitter. We aim to understand the dominant factors that influence NFT asset valuation. Towards this objective, we create a first-of-its-kind dataset linking Twitter and OpenSea (the largest NFT marketplace) to capture social media profiles and linked NFT assets. Our dataset contains 245,159 tweets posted by 17,155 unique users, directly linking 62,997 NFT assets on OpenSea worth 19 Million USD. We have made the dataset publicly available.1We analyze the growth of NFTs, characterize the Twitter users promoting NFT assets, and gauge the impact of Twitter features on the virality of an NFT. Further, we investigate the effectiveness of different social media and NFT platform features by experimenting with multiple machine learning and deep learning models to predict an asset’s value. We model the problem as a binary classification as well as an ordinal classification task. Our results show that social media features improve the ordinal classification accuracy by 6% over baseline models that use only NFT platform features. Among social media features, count of user membership lists, number of likes and replies are important features. On the other hand, OpenSea features like offer entered, bids withdrawn, bid entered and is presale turn out to be important predictors.},

abstract = {Source code representation is critical to the machine-learning-based approach to detecting code vulnerability. This paper proposes Compact Abstract Graphs (CAGs) of source code in different programming languages for predicting a broad range of code vulnerabilities with Graph Neural Network (GNN) models. CAGs make the source code representation aligned with the task of vulnerability classification and reduce the graph size to accelerate model training with minimum impact on the prediction performance. We have applied CAGs to six GNN models and large Java/C datasets with 114 vulnerability types in Java programs and 106 vulnerability types in C programs. The experiment results show that the GNN models have performed well, with accuracy ranging from 94.7% to 96.3% on the Java dataset and from 91.6% to 93.2% on the C dataset. The resultant GNN models have achieved promising performance when applied to more than 2,500 vulnerabilities collected from real-world software projects. The results also show that using CAGs for GNN models is significantly better than ASTs, CFGs (Control Flow Graphs), and PDGs (Program Dependence Graphs). A comparative study has demonstrated that the CAG-based GNN models can outperform the existing methods for machine learning-based vulnerability detection.},

abstract = {The rapid growth of Information Communication Technologies (ICT) has impacted many fields. In this context, the supply chain has also quickly evolved toward the digital supply chain where digital and electronic technologies have been integrated into every aspect of its end-to-end process. This evolution provides numerous benefits such as profit maximization, loss reduction, and the optimization of supply chain lead times. However, the use of such technologies has also considerably opened up various security threats and risks which have widened the attack surface on the entire end-to-end supply chain. We present a holistic survey on supply chain security. We discuss the different security issues and attacks that target the different supply chain technologies. Then, we discuss various countermeasures and security solutions proposed by academic and industry researchers to mitigate the identified threats. Finally, we provide some recommendations and best practices that can be adopted to achieve a secure supply chain.},

After a year of activity, it is high time to evaluate how effective it has been in its mission. At the highest peak, about 22% of the Swiss population was actively using SwissCovid. The activity of SwissCovid follows the curve on the number of COVID-19 cases. However, performances are rather poor. About 1% of the cases may have been discovered by SwissCovid and much less than 2% of SwissCovid alerts may have been useful, while SwissCovid generates 5% of the quarantines. The measure of the proximity of each encounter and its duration are also imprecise. It further comes with security and privacy issues: adversaries can inject false alerts for SwissCovid users and users can be tracked. On top of that, SwissCovid contributes to strengthen the monopoly of Apple and Google and to make users and their data captive of these giants. It also digs the digital divide. Contrarily to the original plan, the implementation is not open source and the law was twisted to fit the constraints by Apple and Google. Therefore, SwissCovid did not meet its goals.},

abstract = {Recently, pre-trained programming language models such as CodeBERT have demonstrated substantial gains in code search. Despite their success, they rely on the availability of large amounts of parallel data to fine-tune the semantic mappings between queries and code. This restricts their practicality in domain-specific languages with relatively scarce and expensive data. In this paper, we propose CDCS, a novel approach for domain-specific code search. CDCS employs a transfer learning framework where an initial program representation model is pre-trained on a large corpus of common programming languages (such as Java and Python), and is further adapted to domain-specific languages such as Solidity and SQL. Unlike cross-language CodeBERT, which is directly fine-tuned in the target language, CDCS adapts a few-shot meta-learning algorithm called MAML to learn the good initialization of model parameters, which can be best reused in a domain-specific language. We evaluate the proposed approach on two domain-specific languages, namely Solidity and SQL, with model transferred from two widely used languages (Python and Java). Experimental results show that CDCS significantly outperforms conventional pre-trained code models that are directly fine-tuned in domain-specific languages, and it is particularly effective for scarce data.},

abstract = {Different malicious activities occur in cryptocurrency-based permissionless blockchains such as Ethereum and Bitcoin. Some activities are due to the exploitation of vulnerabilities which are present in the blockchain infrastructure, some activities target its users through social engineering techniques, while some activities use it to facilitate different malicious activities. Since cryptocurrency-based permissionless blockchains provide pseudonymity to its users, bad actors prefer to carry out transactions related to malicious activities on them. Towards this, we aim at automatically flagging blockchain accounts as suspects that indulge in malicious activities, thus reducing the unintended support that cryptocurrency-based permissionless blockchains provide to malicious actors. We first use the cosine similarity (CS) metrics to study the similarities between the feature vector of accounts associated with different malicious activities and find that most of the malicious activities associated with the Ethereum blockchain behave similarly. We then use the K-Means clustering algorithm to check if accounts associated with similar malicious activities cluster together. We also study the effect of bias on the performance of a machine learning (ML) algorithm, due to the number of accounts associated with malicious activity. We then compare the different state-of-the-art models and identify that Neural Networks (NNs) are resistant to bias associated with a malicious activity and are also robust against adversarial attacks. The previously used ML algorithms for identifying malicious accounts also show bias towards an over-represented malicious activity.},

abstract = {Most NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) use multi-hop URLs to address the off-chain assets due to the costly on-chain storage, but the path from NFTs to the underlying assets is fraught with instability, which may degrade its value. Hence, this paper aims to answer the question: Is the NFT-to-Asset connection fragile? This paper makes a first step towards this end by characterizing NFT-to-Asset connections of 12,353 Ethereum NFT Contracts (6,234,141 NFTs in total) from three perspectives, storage, accessibility, and duplication. In order to overcome challenges of affecting the measurement accuracy, e.g., IPFS instability and the changing availability of both IPFS and servers’ data, we propose to leverage multiple gateways to enlarge the data coverage and extend a longer measurement period with non-trivial efforts. Results of our extensive study show that such connection is very fragile in practice. The loss, unavailability, or duplication of off-chain assets could render the value of NFTs worthless. For instance, we find that assets of 25.24% of Ethereum NFT contracts are not accessible, and 21.48% of Ethereum NFT contracts include duplicated assets. Our work sheds light on the fragility along the NFT-to-Asset connection, which could help the NFT community to better enhance the trust of off-chain assets.},

abstract = {Mutation analysis is a powerful dynamic approach that has many applications, such as measuring the quality of test suites or automatically locating faults. However, the inherent low scalability hampers its practical use. To accelerate mutation analysis, researchers propose approaches to reduce redundant executions. A family of fork-based approaches tries to share identical executions among mutants. Fork-based approaches carry all mutants in one process and decide whether to fork new child processes when reaching a mutated statement. The mutants carried by the parent process are split into groups and distributed to different processes to finish the remaining executions. However, existing fork-based approaches have two limitations: (1) the limited analysis scope on a single statement to compare and cluster mutants prevents their systems from detecting more equivalent mutants, and (2) the interpretation of the mutants and the runtime equivalence analysis introduce significant overhead.In this paper, we present a novel fork-based mutation analysis approach WinMut, which (1) groups mutants in a scope of mutated statements and, (2) removes redundant computations inside interpreters. WinMut not only reduces the number of invoked processes but also has a lower cost for executing a single process. Our experiments show that our approach can further accelerate mutation analysis with an average speedup of 5.57x on top of the state-of-the-art fork-based approach, AccMut.},

abstract = {Zero-Knowledge protocols have increasingly become both popular and practical in recent years due to their applicability in many areas such as blockchain systems. Unfortunately, public verifiability and small proof sizes of zero-knowledge protocols currently come at the price of strong assumptions, large prover time, or both, when considering statements with millions of gates. In this regime, the most prover-efficient protocols are in the designated verifier setting, where proofs are only valid to a single party that must keep a secret state.In this work, we bridge this gap between designated-verifier proofs and public verifiability by distributing the verifier efficiently. Here, a set of verifiers can then verify a proof and, if a given threshold t of the n verifiers is honest and trusted, can act as guarantors for the validity of a statement. We achieve this while keeping the concrete efficiency of current designated-verifier proofs, and present constructions that have small concrete computation and communication cost.

abstract = {Sealed bid auctions are used to allocate a resource among a set of interested parties. Traditionally, auctions need the presence of a trusted auctioneer to whom the bidders provide their private bid values. Existence of such a trusted party is not an assumption easily realized in practice. Generic secure computation protocols can be used to remove a trusted party. However, generic techniques result in inefficient protocols, and typically do not provide fairness -- that is, a corrupt party can learn the output and abort the protocol thereby preventing other parties from learning the output. At CRYPTO 2009, Miltersen, Nielsen and Triandopoulos~citeC:MilNieTri09, introduced the problem of building auctions that are secure against rational bidders. Such parties are modeled as self-interested agents who care more about maximizing their utility than about learning information about bids of other agents. To realize this, they put forth a novel notion of information utility and introduce a game-theoretic framework that helps analyse protocols while taking into account both information utility as well as monetary utility. Unfortunately, their construction makes use a of generic MPC protocol and, consequently, the authors do not analyze the concrete efficiency of their protocol. In this work, we construct the first concretely efficient and provably secure protocol for First Price Auctions in therational setting. Our protocol guarantees privacy, public verifiability and fairness. Inspired by~citeC:MilNieTri09, we put forth a solution concept that we callPrivacy Enhanced Computational Weakly Dominant Strategy Equilibrium that captures parties' privacy and monetary concerns in the game theoretic context, and show that our protocol realizes this. We believe this notion to be of independent interest. Our protocol is crafted specifically for the use case of auctions, is simple, using off-the-shelf cryptographic components. Executing our auction protocol on commodity hardware with 30 bidders, with bids of length 10, our protocol runs to completion in 0.429s and has total communication of 82KB.},

However, the contradiction between the high Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of massive data and the limited network bandwidth and the heterogeneous network is becoming deeper and deeper. The heterogeneity of smart factory networks brings many challenges to unified access and fusion, real-time transmission, and centralized control and management. This article provides a survey on heterogeneous networks in smart factories. We first study and discuss the heterogeneity of smart factory networks, and then discuss the existing mainstream wired and wireless network technologies, as well as promising future technologies, including 5G, OLE for Process Control Unified Architecture (OPC UA), and Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). In addition, we also analyze current heterogeneous network fusion architecture and discuss the enabling technologies of heterogeneous network fusion in view of the shortcoming of the current solutions. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of open challenges and future research directions towards the effective realization of the smart factory.},

The peer-to-peer distributed ledger platform connects organizations and car owners with disparate interests and hidden intentions. While previous literature has chiefly examined incentives for permissionless platforms, we leverage studies about crowdsensing applications to stimulate research on incentives in permissioned blockchains. This article uses the action design research approach to create an incentive system featuring a rating mechanism influenced by data correction measures. Furthermore, we propose relying on certain institutions capable of assessing data generated within the system. This combined approach of a decentralized data correction and an institutionalized data assessment is distinct from similar incentive systems suggested by literature. By using an agent-based model with strategy evolution, we evaluate the proposed incentive system. Our findings indicate that a rating-based revenue distribution leads to markedly higher data quality in the system. Additionally, the incentive system reveals hidden information of the agents and alleviates agency problems, contributing to an understanding of incentive design in inter-organizational blockchain-based data platforms. Furthermore, we explore incentive design in permissioned blockchains and discuss its latest implications.},

abstract = {Adversaries in cryptography have traditionally been modeled as either semi-honest or malicious. Over the years, however, several works have investigated the design of cryptographic protocols against rational adversaries. The most well-known example are covert adversaries in secure computation (Aumann &amp; Lindell, TCC '07) which are adversaries that wish to deviate from the protocol but without being detected. Protocols secure against such covert adversaries guarantee that deviations are detected with probability at least - which is known as the deterrence factor.In this work, we initiate the study of contracts in cryptographic protocol design. We show how to design, use and analyze contracts between parties for the purpose of incentivizing honest behavior from rational adversaries. We refer to such contracts as adversarial level agreements (ALA). The framework we propose can result in more efficient protocols and can enforce deterrence in covert protocols; meaning that one can guarantee that a given deterrence factor will deter the adversary instead of assuming it.We show how to apply our framework to two-party protocols, including secure two-party computation (2PC) and proofs of storage (PoS). In the 2PC case, we integrate ALAs to publicly-verifiable covert protocols and show, through a game-theoretic analysis, how to set the parameters of the ALA to guarantee honest behavior. We do the same for PoS which are two-party protocols that allow a client to efficiently verify the integrity of a file stored in the cloud.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is impacting the world’s connectivity landscape. More and more IoT devices are connected, bringing many benefits to our daily lives. However, the influx of IoT devices poses non-trivial challenges for the existing cloud-based computing paradigm. In the cloud-based architecture, a large amount of IoT data is transferred to the cloud for data management, analysis, and decision making. It could not only cause a heavy workload on the cloud but also result in unacceptable network latency, ultimately undermining the benefits of cloud-based computing. To address these challenges, researchers are looking for new computing models for the IoT. Edge computing, a new decentralized computing model, is valued by more and more researchers in academia and industry. The main idea of edge computing is placing data processing in near-edge devices instead of remote cloud servers. It is promising to build more scalable, low-latency IoT systems. Many studies have been proposed on edge computing and IoT, but a comprehensive survey of this crossover area is still lacking.In this survey, we first introduce the impact of edge computing on the development of IoT and point out why edge computing is more suitable for IoT than other computing paradigms. Then, we analyze the necessity of systematical investigation on the edge-computing-driven IoT (ECDriven-IoT) and summarize new challenges occurring in ECDriven-IoT. We categorize recent advances from bottom to top, covering six aspects of ECDriven-IoT. Finally, we conclude lessons learned and propose some challenging},

abstract = {Conventional wireless technologies such as LTE/5G and WiFi on sub-6GHz frequency bands have been at the core of the wireless communication and networking revolution for various applications. However, these conventional wireless technologies are insufficient to meet the high throughput, latency, and reliability of emerging vertical services such as autonomous vehicles, metaverse, and holographic communications. These emerging novel services not only exchange data but also critically rely on accurate information about the surrounding environment for their operation. Moving to mmWave/THz frequencies and beyond, integrating communication and sensing, embedding artificial intelligence into wireless networks, etc., are essential for future wireless networks. The first EmergingWireless workshop brings together researchers and practitioners from different communities to explore emerging wireless technologies and debate and discuss priorities and challenges in the research agenda.},

ASPLOS ’23 features 3 deadlines spaced throughout the year and papers will be published in three volumes. Multiple deadlines are meant to encourage authors to submit their papers when ready and to facilitate the selection of some papers for revision. For this volume of ASPLOS ’23, we discontinued the use of the 2-page extended abstract submissions that were used in ASPLOS ’21 and ASPLOS ’22. We found the extended abstract offered limited filtering and moved to a more traditional two phase review process. Each paper received 3 reviews in phase 1 and papers with positive scores advanced to the second round and received up to 2 more reviews. In our preface to Volume III, we will give a more detailed rundown of how the process worked.},
