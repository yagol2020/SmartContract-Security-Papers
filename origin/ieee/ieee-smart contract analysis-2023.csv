Many static analysis tools have been developed to facilitate the contract audit process, but not all of them take account of two special features of smart contracts: (1) The external variables, like time, are constrained by real-world factors; (2) The internal variables persist between executions. Since these features import implicit constraints into contracts, they significantly affect the performance of static tools, such as causing errors in reachability analysis and resulting in false positives. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study on implicit constraints from three aspects. First, we summarize the implicit constraints in smart contracts. Second, we evaluate the impact of such constraints on the state-of-the-art static tools. Third, we propose a lightweight but effective mitigation method named ConSym to deal with such constraints and integrate it into OSIRIS. The evaluation result shows that ConSym can filter out 96% of false positives and reduce false negatives by two-thirds.","","978-1-6654-9590-5","10.1145/3510457.3513076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9793963","Smart contract;Static analysis;Implicit constraints;Code audit","Systematics;Smart contracts;Static analysis;Time factors;Reachability analysis;Software engineering","blockchains;contracts;program diagnostics;reachability analysis;security of data;software tools","contract audit process;implicit constraints;reachability analysis;smart contract static analysis tools;attractive attack targets;OSIRIS","","","","11","","17 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Smart contracts are used in many areas of the economy in the form adapted to solve a specific business problem. Thus, today one can observe rapidly growing varieties of smart contracts. However, developers often do not explore the limitations and risks of using this technology for specific use cases. At the same time, the losses resulting from the limited use of technology in a particular subject area can be very significant. In order to build effective protection in the blockchain network, it is necessary to analyze the object of protection for the components that are valuable to the attacker, as well as to determine the vulnerabilities of the product through which illegitimate entry into the network is possible. Attacks can target the consensus algorithm, flaws in smart contract programming languages, or flaws in the blockchain structure itself. In addition to vulnerabilities, there are also operational security issues such as private key or host system compromise. This paper provides a detailed analysis of the security of a smart contract that implements the functions of a shipping contract.

This paper is aimed to analyze the variation from the very first smart contract tools to the newest one, to discuss their pros and cons of them. This experiment mainly chose three fuzzing tools, several basic and classic smart contracts as tested material, and recorded the performance of fuzzing contracts of each tool. And the results are clear to show that even the newest fuzzer has a better performance than the other, but it is better to use it depending on the specific requirements while the rest of the two fuzzing tools has some advantages in some aspect.

Since then, attacks on smart contracts have increased. Thus, the security issue of smart contracts has attracted more and more attention from the community, putting pressure on developers to discover security issues in smart contracts before deploying them. To address this problem, many researchers have developed smart contract analyzers to early detect potential vulnerabilities. However, a common problem with these tools is a large number of alarms with a high false positive rate. Consequently, developers need to spend much time and effort investigating the alarms which are falsely detected as vulnerable. In this paper, we propose SCAR, a novel approach to prioritize the alarms of static analysis tools. Based on the intuition that alarms with similar contexts tend to have the same labels (true positive or false positive), SCAR is built with two deep learning models to capture the patterns associated with the contexts of the labeled alarms. After that, for new alarms, SCAR calculates their likelihood to be true positives and ranks them according to the predicted scores. SCAR is evaluated on a large data set of 14,184 alarms from 47,518 realworld smart contracts. The results show that the programmers can productively find up to two-thirds of the actual vulnerabilities by investigating only 20% of the ranked alarms.","2640-0715","978-1-6654-5537-4","10.1109/APSEC57359.2022.00060","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10043329","Static analysis alarms;vulnerability;false positive;smart contract;representation learning","Deep learning;Smart contracts;Static analysis;Security;Context modeling;Software engineering","blockchains;contracts;deep learning (artificial intelligence);program diagnostics","deep learning models;labeled alarms;ranked alarms;SCAR;security issue;smart contract alarm ranking;smart contract analyzers","","","","16","IEEE","16 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is a ground-breaking technology that allows users to communicate without the need of a trusted middleman. A smart contract (self-executable code) is deployed on the blockchain and auto executes due to a triggering condition. In a no-trust contracting environment, smart contracts can establish trust among parties. Terms and conditions embedded in smart contracts will be imposed immediately when specified criteria have been fulfilled. Due to this, the malicious assailants have a special interest in smart contracts. Blockchains are immutable means if some transaction is deployed or recorded on the blockchain, it becomes unalterable. Thus, smart contracts must be analyzed to ensure zero security vulnerabilities or flaws before deploying the same on the blockchain because a single vulnerability can lead to the loss of millions. For analyzing the security vulnerabilities of smart contracts, various analysis tools have been developed to create safe and secure smart contracts. This paper presents a systematic review on Ethereum smart contracts analysis tools. Initially, these tools are categorized into static and dynamic analysis tools. Thereafter, different sources code analysis techniques are studied such as taint analysis, symbolic execution, and fuzzing techniques.

However, existing vulnerability detection techniques such as static analysis, symbol execution, and fuzz testing could be unable to expose new types of vulnerabilities in time because they rely on extracting vulnerability features manually. On the other hand, vulnerability detection techniques based on machine learning do not require experts to define features manually and can learn vulnerability patterns automatically. In this paper, we propose a vulnerability detection technique for smart contracts, which extracts smart contract features based on the abstract syntax tree (AST) and trains the model to detect smart contract vulnerabilities. Experiment results show that the model achieves an average accuracy of 98.7% and F1-value of 0.885 in detecting three kinds of security vulnerabilities.","","978-1-6654-5397-4","10.1109/ISSSR56778.2022.00032","Beijing Information Science and Technology University(grant numbers:QXTCP C201906); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9973789","Smart Contract;Vulnerability Detection;Source Code Representation;Abstract Syntax Tree","Deep learning;Smart contracts;Symbols;Static analysis;Syntactics;Fuzzing;Feature extraction","blockchains;contracts;learning (artificial intelligence)","abstract syntax tree;AST;blockchain;computer programs;machine learning;security vulnerabilities;smart contract vulnerability detection;vulnerability patterns","","","","10","IEEE","14 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a blockchain network, Solana is a de-centralized public ledger for verifying and recording transactions. The Solana blockchain has smart contract capabilities. Unlike other blockchains, such as Ethereum, there is no repository or tool where to check for the source code of the smart contracts stored in the blockchain. These tools are crucial to increase the users' trust in this type of technology. Indeed, one of the most important features of the blockchain is transparency, i.e. the possibility to see the source code of the program to use, or in which the users wish to invest. However, in the blockchains that support smart contracts, what is stored is not the source code of the smart contract written in a high-level program understandable to humans, but the bytecode, i.e. a low-level code made for the hardware to be executed. For some blockchains, such as Ethereum, there are different tools, such as integrated development environment (IDE), that allow to verify that the smart contracts' source code corresponds to the bytecode installed on the nodes of the blockchain. Moreover, there are different repositories that collect smart contracts written in a high-level programming language and their corresponding bytecode. However, for the Solana blockchain, all these tools do not exist yet. The study proposes a web tool that allows verifying the ownership of a smart contract, i. e. the smart contracts' source code written in a high-level programming language corresponds to the bytecode deployed in the Solana blockchain. Moreover, we have published smart contracts' source code written in high-level programming via a public service that can be used by researchers, smart contract developers, and blockchain not-expert users.","1534-5351","978-1-6654-3786-8","10.1109/SANER53432.2022.00140","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9825771","Blockchain;Solana;Source Code","Computer languages;Codes;Conferences;Smart contracts;Programming;Software;Hardware","blockchains;contracts;high level languages;software tools","source code;high level programming language;Solana blockchain;smart contract developers;blockchain platform;blockchain network;smart contract capabilities;support smart contracts;SOL;recording transactions;verifying transactions","","","","25","IEEE","21 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the development and advancement of blockchain technology, the core technology in blockchain - smart contracts - has attracted much attention. The technology automates the execution of contracts on the blockchain in the form of code, allowing trusted transactions to take place without a third party, which are traceable and irreversible. The technology involves collaboration between different fields such as computer science and laws, but most traditional professionals lack programming skills, resulting in the current application of smart contracts can not meet cross-industry demand. This paper propose a method to generate smart contracts automatically. Users can model the contract by OWL(Web Ontology Language) and write SWRL(Semantic Web Rule Language) semantic rules to describe contract. Then use recursive descent analysis to implement a LL(1) syntax parser that recognises SWRL and generates the corresponding smart contract code based on the semantic rules of SWRL. The contract management module allows users to generate, install and manage smart contracts directly from the front-end page, which lowers the threshold for users to manage the blockchain network. We validate the usability of the contract generation and management module using the compliance inspection of RMC (ready-mixed concrete), which is based on HyperLedger Fabric. The system can generate smart contract code that corresponds logically to the quality specification.","","978-1-6654-6403-1","10.1109/ICRSS57469.2022.00017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10086472","Smart Contract;Recursive Descent Analysis;SWRL;HyperLedger Fabric","Codes;Distributed ledger;Smart contracts;Semantics;Contract management;Supply chains;Writing","blockchains;contracts;knowledge representation languages;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web","blockchain technology;contract generation;contract management module;corresponding smart contract code;incomplete credit mechanism;information asymmetry;recursive descent analysis-based solution;smart contracts;supply chain","","","","14","IEEE","3 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A large number of developers are optimistic about the development prospects of smart contracts. However, due to different levels of familiarity of developers with technology, the existence of serious vulnerabilities in code can result in huge property losses. The serious consequences of reentrancy vulnerabilities have attracted widespread attention from researchers, and researchers have proposed many approaches to detect them. Many experiments show that these approaches can only effectively detect certain types of vulnerabilities. Similar vulnerabilities still exist in some smart contracts. In this paper, we propose a semantic analysis-based detection method for reentrancy vulnerabilities. The method utilizes machine learning techniques to efficiently detect the vulnerabilities of the given code. And then, our method provides semantic analysis-based effective correction feedback of the code. Compared with the existing vulnerability detection tools Slither and Mythril, our method improves the work efficiency.

Although lots of researches have been conducted, they mostly focus on off-chain vulnerability detection. However, smart contracts cannot be modified once they have been deployed on-chain, thus existing techniques cannot protect those deployed contracts from being attacked. To mitigate this problem, we propose a general smart contract repairer named Aroc, which can automatically patch vulnerable deployed contracts without changing the contract codes. The core insight of Aroc is to generate patch contracts to abort malicious transactions in advance. Taking the three most serious bug types (i.e., reentrancy, arithmetic bugs, and unchecked low-level checks) as examples, we present how Aroc automatically repairs them on-chain. We conduct abundant evaluations on four kinds of datasets to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of Aroc. In particular, Aroc can repair 95.95% of the vulnerable contracts with an average correctness ratio of 93.32%. Meanwhile, Aroc introduces acceptable additional overheads to smart contract users and blockchain miners. When compared with the state-of-the-art techniques, Aroc introduces either fewer execution overheads or contract codes.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2021.3123170","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1006000); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072202,62002125); Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou, China(grant numbers:201902020016); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2020JYCXJJ068); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9591399","Smart contract;vulnerability;repair;on-chain protection","Contracts;Smart contracts;Codes;Blockchains;Computer bugs;Maintenance engineering;Task analysis","blockchains;contracts","Aroc;automatic repair framework;automatically patch vulnerable deployed contracts;blockchain;contract codes;general smart contract repairer;off-chain vulnerability detection;on-chain smart contracts;patch contracts;serious bug types;smart contract attack events;vulnerable contracts","","","","40","CCBYNCND","27 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Blood pressure, Bilirubin level, Energy level, SGOT & SGPT level, blood sugar level, and Total Protein are all factors that can be observed to predict liver disease in its early stages. The existing healthcare infrastructure is being transformed by technology. With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), doctors can now remotely monitor and analyze patients, keep their data, and process it for further examination. However, there is a requirement to introduce advanced and improved secured algorithms for quick event processing and detection. In this work, an integrated Smart Contract (SC) and Machine Learning (ML) based system is presented for detecting liver disease that, in addition to storing data in the blockchain, notifies the doctor about the patient's health status. blockchain technology provides a secure environment for storing confidential patient data. Since blockchain data is tamper-resistant, it effectively prevents unauthorized access and data falsification. Using the concept of ML, decision tree classifier variants, such as J48, Hoeffding Tree, Decision Stump, and Random Forest, are applied to the liver patient dataset for efficient classification in order to design the proposed system. The best classifier is chosen based on performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F- score, etc. Finally, the selected classifier's rules are encoded in the smart contract to allow automatic and timely detection of disease. This work also discusses the proposed work's functioning and the evaluation results.","","978-1-6654-5415-5","10.1109/CCET56606.2022.10080177","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10080177","Blockchain;ML;J48;Smart Contract;Liver Disease","Proteins;Liver diseases;Smart contracts;Software;Blockchains;Internet of Things;Biomedical monitoring","authorisation;blockchains;contracts;decision trees;diseases;electronic health records;health care;Internet of Things;liver;medical diagnostic computing;patient diagnosis;patient monitoring;pattern classification;random forests","automated liver disease detection system;bilirubin level;blockchain data;blockchain technology;blood pressure;blood sugar level;classifier rules;confidential patient data storage;data falsification;data tamper-resistance;decision stump;decision tree classifier;energy level;healthcare infrastructure;Hoeffding tree;Internet of Things;IoT;liver disease prediction;liver patient dataset;machine learning;patient analysis;patient health status;patient monitoring;random forest;SGOT level;SGPT level;smart contract;unauthorized access","","","","12","IEEE","3 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence, there is a significant need to write secure and well-performing contracts and ensure their high reliability. To overcome these challenges, we propose an automated static framework SolChecker, for vulnerability detection on Solidity smart contracts. It works by analyzing information extracted from constructed abstract syntax tree of Solidity smart contracts, and developers can use the analyzed results to design detectors for specific vulnerabilities according to their needs. In this paper, we present an overview of SolChecker, provide the detailed design of each component, and evaluate the capabilities of the designed detectors on 47,037 real-world contracts. Furthermore, we clarify the effect of each extracted information by performing a comparative experiment on 500 contracts sampled from the dataset.

However, current smart contract test case generation methods do not regard the impact of other functions in the smart contract on state variables, resulting in the inaccessibility of the control statements related to state variables and low branch coverage of the function under test. To alleviate this problem, this paper proposes SV-Gen. SV-Gen generates test cases for smart contracts through two steps: static analysis and dynamic search. In the first step, SV-Gen considers the read-write relationship between functions and state variables in the smart contract to generate a function invocation sequence for the function to be tested through a backtracking algorithm on state variables. Then the arguments of transactions to invoke each function in the sequence are generated through regex matching to form the primitive test case. In the second step, the primitive test cases constitute an initial population, and a genetic algorithm undertakes the task of evolving them to high branch coverage. The experimental results on one of the VeriSmart datasets show that SV-Gen can effectively enter the control constraints related to state variables and improve the branch coverage of smart contracts.","2693-9177","978-1-6654-7704-8","10.1109/QRS57517.2022.00077","Nanjing University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062400","Ethereum smart contract;test case generation;state variable;data dependency analysis;genetic algorithm","Smart contracts;Software algorithms;Sociology;Static analysis;Software quality;Software reliability;Security","backtracking;blockchains;contracts;cryptocurrencies;genetic algorithms;program diagnostics;program testing","current smart contract test case generation methods;Ethereum smart contract;primitive test case;state variable","","","","32","IEEE","20 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The detection of contract vulnerabilities is currently a research hotspot in blockchain security [1]. Current research methods are mainly based on traditional software defect analysis methods for vulnerabilities detection, but the detection accuracy and false alarm rate are not satisfactory. In this paper, we propose a bidirectional long short-term memory neural network model (HAM-BiLSTM for short) with hierarchical attention mechanism, which takes the code segment and account information of a smart contract as input. It divides the input samples into three levels as documents: word level, sentence level and document level, and introduces attention mechanism in different levels. The aim is to detect reentrancy vulnerability more accurately and reduce the false alarm rate of the model as much as possible. The neural network model classifies smart contracts through softmax layers by learning feature information from training samples to determine the presence of reentrancy vulnerability. The experiments demonstrate that our proposed solution and model increase detection accuracy and reduce false alarm rate.","","978-1-6654-9691-9","10.1109/ICBCTIS55569.2022.00024","Chongqing Research Program of Basic Research and Frontier Technology(grant numbers:cstc2018jcyjAX0617); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9845089","smart contract;deep learning;attention mechanism","Training;Codes;Smart contracts;Neural networks;Information security;Software;Blockchains","blockchains;feature extraction;financial data processing;learning (artificial intelligence);recurrent neural nets;software reliability","reentrancy vulnerability detection;smart contract;bidirectional sequential neural network;hierarchical attention mechanism;contract vulnerabilities;blockchain security;vulnerabilities detection;false alarm rate;bidirectional long short-term memory neural network model;software defect analysis methods;softmax layers","","1","","8","IEEE","11 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Current research on smart contract classification focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) solutions which are based on contract source code. However, more than 94% of smart contracts are not open-source, so the application scenarios of NLP methods are very limited. Meanwhile, NLP models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This paper proposes a classification model based on features from contract bytecode instead of source code to solve these problems. We also use feature selection and ensemble learning to optimize the model. Our experimental studies on over 11K real-world Ethereum smart contracts show that our model can classify smart contracts without source code and has better performance than baseline models. Our model also has good resistance to adversarial attacks compared with NLP-based models.

They are immutable and cannot be modified, even when bugs are detected. Therefore, ensuring smart contracts are bug-free and well-designed before deploying them to the blockchain is extremely important. A contract defect is an error, flaw or fault in a smart contract that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. Detecting and removing contract defects can avoid potential bugs and make programs more robust. Our previous work defined 20 contract defects for smart contracts and divided them into five impact levels. According to our classification, contract defects with seriousness level between 1-3 can lead to unwanted behaviors, e.g., a contract being controlled by attackers. In this paper, we propose DefectChecker, a symbolic execution-based approach and tool to detect eight contract defects that can cause unwanted behaviors of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain platform. DefectChecker can detect contract defects from smart contracts’ bytecode. We verify the performance of DefectChecker by applying it to an open-source dataset. Our evaluation results show that DefectChecker obtains a high F-score (88.8 percent in the whole dataset) and only requires 0.15s to analyze one smart contract on average. We also applied DefectChecker to 165,621 distinct smart contracts on the Ethereum platform. We found that 25,815 of these smart contracts contain at least one of the contract defects that belongs to impact level 1-3, including some real-world attacks.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2021.3054928","Australian Research Council(grant numbers:DE200100021); ARC Laureate Fellowship funding scheme(grant numbers:FL190100035); ARC Discovery(grant numbers:DP200100020); Singapore's Ministry of Education(grant numbers:MOE2019-T2-1-193); Hong Kong RGC Project(grant numbers:152193/19E); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872057); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB0804100); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9337195","Smart contracts;ethereum;contract defects detection;bytecode analyze;symbolic execution","Smart contracts;Blockchain;Tools;Computer bugs;Computer hacking;Virtual machining;Organizations","blockchains;contracts;Java;program debugging;program diagnostics;program testing;program verification;Turing machines","automated smart contract defect detection;DefectChecker;EVM bytecode analysis;Turing-complete programs;bug-free smart contract;symbolic execution-based approach;Ethereum blockchain platform;open-source dataset","","18","","44","IEEE","27 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An interesting example of such graphs is control-flow graphs representing possible software code execution flows. As such graphs represent more semantic information of code, developing techniques and tools for such graphs can be highly beneficial for detecting vulnerabilities in software for its reliability. However, existing heterogeneous graph techniques are still insufficient in handling complex graphs where the number of different types of nodes and edges is large and variable. This paper concentrates on the Ethereum smart contracts as a sample of software codes represented by heterogeneous contract graphs built upon both control-flow graphs and call graphs containing different types of nodes and links. We propose MANDO, a new heterogeneous graph representation to learn such heterogeneous contract graphs’ structures. MANDO extracts customized meta-paths, which compose relational connections between different types of nodes and their neighbors. Moreover, it develops a multi-metapath heterogeneous graph attention network to learn multi-level embeddings of different types of nodes and their metapaths in the heterogeneous contract graphs, which can capture the code semantics of smart contracts more accurately and facilitate both fine-grained line-level and coarse-grained contract-level vulnerability detection. Our extensive evaluation of large smart contract datasets shows that MANDO improves the vulnerability detection results of other techniques at the coarse-grained contract level. More importantly, it is the first learning-based approach capable of identifying vulnerabilities at the fine-grained line-level, and significantly improves the traditional code analysis-based vulnerability detection approaches by 11.35% to 70.81% in terms of F1-score.","","978-1-6654-7330-9","10.1109/DSAA54385.2022.10032337","Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10032337","heterogeneous graphs;graph embedding;graph neural networks;vulnerability detection;smart contracts;Ethereum blockchain","Codes;Image edge detection;Smart contracts;Semantics;Data science;Software;Software reliability","blockchains;contracts;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence)","coarse-grained contract level;complex graphs;control-flow graphs;Ethereum smart contracts;fine-grained detection;fine-grained line-level;heterogeneous contract graphs;heterogeneous graph representation;heterogeneous graph techniques;heterogeneous graphs;homogeneous graph techniques;MANDO;multilevel embeddings;multilevel heterogeneous graph embeddings;multimetapath heterogeneous graph attention network;possible software code execution;smart contract datasets;smart contract vulnerabilities;software codes;traditional code analysis-based vulnerability detection approaches;vulnerability detection results","","1","","34","IEEE","8 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a GVD-net model for smart contract vulnerability detection. GVD-net consists of preprocessing section,backbone-net and detection section.We prepossess the source code and gain a weight matrix in the first section. In backbone-net, we generate a CFG graph according to the variables and function calling relationships of the solidity code, and use the CFG graph to build the corresponding relationship of nodes and generate a non-Euclidean graph. Then we use the adjacent search algorithm to generate a non-complete random walk sequence, and use the graph embedding algorithm Node2Vec to generate a 256-dimensional vector and gain another weight matrix. We input the test code into GVD-net to generate the threshold ϑ in the final section and will classify the smart contract as danger code if the ϑ is bigger than 0.75. Moreover, GVD-net will confirm the type of vulnerability according to weight matrix. We conduct comprehensive experiments on GVD-net with the SBcurated data-set, and the experiment results show that (1) GVD-net can classify a smart contract as safe or danger code, with the accuracy of 90.2% (2) GVD-net can detect three types of vulnerability (arithmetic issues, access control and asset frozen) and attain good performance within 1s.","","978-1-6654-5472-8","10.1109/ADMIT57209.2022.00024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9974924","","Access control;Codes;Machine learning algorithms;Source coding;Smart contracts;Manuals;Machine learning","arithmetic;authorisation;blockchains;contracts;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;random processes;search problems;source code (software);vectors","256-dimensional vector;access control;adjacent search algorithm;arithmetic issues;asset frozen;backbone-net;CFG graph;Dapps;decentralized blockchain network;distributed blockchain network;Ethereum smart contract;false detection rate;function calling relationships;graph embedding-based machine learning;GVD-net;Node2Vec;noncomplete random walk sequence;nonEuclidean graph;SBcurated data-set;security vulnerabilities;smart contract vulnerability detection;solidity code;source code;weight matrix","","2","","16","IEEE","16 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing efforts for contract security analysis heavily rely on rigid rules defined by experts, which are labor-intensive and non-scalable. There is still a lack of effort that considers combining expert-defined security patterns with deep learning. This paper proposes EtherGIS, a vulnerability detection framework that utilizes graph neural networks (GNN) and expert knowledge to extract the graph feature from smart contract control flow graphs (CFG). To gain multi-dimensional contract information and reinforce the attention of vulnerability-related graph features, sensitive EVM instruction corpora are constructed by analyzing EVM underlying logic and diverse vulnerability triggering mechanisms. The characteristic of nodes and edges in a CFG is initially confirmed according to the corpora, generating the corresponding attribute graph. GNN is adopted to aggregate the whole graph's attribute and structure information, bridging the semantic gap between low-level graph features and high-level contract features. The feature representation of the graph is finally input into the graph classification model for vulnerability detection. Furthermore, automated machine learning (AutoML) is adopted to automate the entire deep learning process. Data for this research was collected from Ethereum to build up a dataset of six vulnerabilities for evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that EtherGIS can productively detect vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Smart contracts from various fields now hold over one trillion dollars worth of virtual coins, attracting numerous attacks. Quite a few practitioners have devoted themselves to developing tools for detecting bugs in smart contracts. One line of efforts revolve around static analysis techniques, which heavily suffer from high false positive rates. Another line of works concentrate on fuzzing techniques. Unfortunately, current fuzzing approaches for smart contracts tend to conduct fuzzing starting from the initial state of the contract, which expends too much energy revolving around the initial state of the contract and thus is usually unable to unearth bugs triggered by other states. Moreover, most existing methods treat each branch equally, failing to take care of the branches that are rare or more likely to possess bugs. This might lead to resources wasted on normal branches. In this paper, we try to tackle these challenges from three aspects: 1) generating function invocation sequences, we explicitly consider data dependencies between functions to facilitate exploring richer states. We further prolong a function invocation sequence  $\mathcal {S}_{1}$  by appending a new sequence  $\mathcal {S}_{2}$ , so that the appended sequence  $\mathcal {S}_{2}$  can start fuzzing from states that are different from the initial state; 2) we incorporate a branch distance-based measure to evolve test cases iteratively towards a target branch; 3) we engage a branch search algorithm to discover rare and vulnerable branches, and design an energy allocation mechanism to take care of exercising these crucial branches. We implement IR-Fuzz and extensively evaluate it over 12K real-world contracts. Empirical results show that: (i) IR-Fuzz achieves 28% higher branch coverage than state-of-the-art fuzzing approaches, (ii) IR-Fuzz detects more vulnerabilities and increases the average accuracy of vulnerability detection by 7% over current methods, and (iii) IR-Fuzz is fast, generating an average of 350 test cases per second.

Another gap is the maintenance and evolution support for smart contracts leveraging the publicly available usage data. We propose high-level gas cost profiles and review which profiles are considered in the existing literature. Additionally, we sampled around 68,000 smart contract interactions from three years, analyzed them using the gas cost profiles, and compare the findings to the current focus in literature.

Existing efforts for contract security analysis heavily rely on rigid rules defined by experts, which are labor-intensive and non-scalable. More importantly, expert-defined rules tend to be error-prone and suffer the inherent risk of being cheated by crafty attackers. Recent researches focus on the symbolic execution and formal analysis of smart contracts for vulnerability detection, yet to achieve a precise and scalable solution. Although several methods have been proposed to detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts, there is still a lack of effort that considers combining expert-defined security patterns with deep neural networks. In this paper, we explore using graph neural networks and expert knowledge for smart contract vulnerability detection. Specifically, we cast the rich control- and data- flow semantics of the source code into a contract graph. To highlight the critical nodes in the graph, we further design a node elimination phase to normalize the graph. Then, we propose a novel temporal message propagation network to extract the graph feature from the normalized graph, and combine the graph feature with designed expert patterns to yield a final detection system. Extensive experiments are conducted on all the smart contracts that have source code in Ethereum and VNT Chain platforms. Empirical results show significant accuracy improvements over the state-of-the-art methods on three types of vulnerabilities, where the detection accuracy of our method reaches 89.15, 89.02, and 83.21 percent for reentrancy, timestamp dependence, and infinite loop vulnerabilities, respectively.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2021.3095196","Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:LQ19F020001); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61902348,61802345); Research Program of Zhejiang Lab(grant numbers:2019KD0AC02); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9477066","Deep learning;blockchain;smart contract;vulnerability detection;expert knowledge","Smart contracts;Feature extraction;Blockchain;Security;Semantics;Computer bugs;Knowledge engineering","blockchains;contracts;deep learning (artificial intelligence);graph neural networks;inference mechanisms","contract security analysis;designed expert patterns;Ethereum;expert knowledge;expert-defined rules;expert-defined security patterns;graph feature;graph neural networks;hacker attacks;infinite loop vulnerabilities;reentrancy;smart contract vulnerability detection;smart contracts;timestamp dependence;VNT Chain platforms;vulnerability detection","","38","","65","IEEE","7 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, a more reasonable way is to employ the real transactions on Ethereum to trigger the contracts before and after optimization, and then compare the Gas consumption. To achieve this goal, we proposed a method, GOV, to estimate the Gas consumption of the optimized contract by using the real transactions on Ethereum.

Unfortunately, the improper use of low-level functions can lead to security vulnerabilities leading to heavy financial losses. Therefore, the Solidity community has suggested alternatives for the low-level functions in the official guidelines for developers. We first perform a large-scale empirical study on the use of low-level functions in Ethereum smart contracts written in Solidity. We find that such functions are widely used in real-world Ethereum smart contracts, and that the majority of these uses are gratuitous for the smart contract's functionality. We then propose GoHigh, a source-to-source transformation tool to eliminate low-level function-related vulnerabilities, by replacing low-level functions with high-level alternatives. We evaluate GoHigh on over 300,000 real-world smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. GoHigh replaces all low-level functions that are amenable to replacement in the contracts with 17% fewer compiler warnings, and the externally-visible behaviors of at least 92 % of the replaced contracts are identical to the original ones.

Once deployed, smart contracts are immutable, thus, defects in the deployed code cannot be fixed. As a consequence, software engineering anti-patterns, such as code cloning, pose a threat to code quality and security if unnoticed before deployment. In this paper, we report on the cloning practices of the Ethereum blockchain platform by analyzing 33,073 smart contracts amounting to over 4MLOC. Prior work reported an unusually high 79.2% of code clones in Ethereum smart contracts. We replicate this study at the conceptual level, i.e., we answer the same research questions by employing different methods. In particular, we analyze clones at the granularity of functions instead of code files, thereby providing a more fine-grained estimate of the clone ratio. Furthermore, we analyze more complex clone types, allowing for a richer analysis of cloning cases. To achieve this finer granularity of cloning analysis, we rely on the NiCad clone detection tool and extend it with support for Solidity, the programming language of the Ethereum platform. Our analysis shows that most findings of the original study hold at the finer granularity of our study as well; but also sheds light on some differences, and contributes new findings. Most notably, we report a 30.13% overall clone ratio, out of which 27.03% are exact duplicates. Our findings motivate improving the reuse mechanisms of Solidity, and in a broader context, of programming languages used for the development of smart contracts.

In other words, it is developing low-cost smart contracts for distributed applications.

They encode contractual agreements on the basis of source code, which else need to be contractualized in natural language. While the mediation of contractual agreements via smart contracts is seamless in theory, it requires that the conditions of an interaction are accurately made available in the blockchain. Time is a prominent such condition. In the paper at hand, we empirically measure the consistency of a smart contract to yield equal results on the basis of the time of an interaction and its potentially inaccurate representation in the blockchain. We propose a novel metric called execution accuracy to measure this consistency. We specifically measure the execution accuracy of a time intervalconstrained smart contract that executes distinct logic within and without some constraint interval. We run experiments for the local Ganache and Quorum and the public Görli and Rinkeby Ethereum blockchains. Our experiments confirm our intuition that execution accuracy decreases near interval bounds. The novelty of our proposed metric resides in its capacity to quantify this decrease. We demonstrate how time constraints can be effectively stipulated on the basis of execution accuracy measurements.","","978-1-6654-9172-3","10.1109/DAPPS55202.2022.00010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9899853","time-sensitive smart contract;execution accuracy;time injection;block timestamp method;injection accuracy;time interval constraint","Smart contracts;Natural languages;Organizations;Decentralized applications;Particle measurements;Time measurement;Blockchains","blockchains;contracts;human factors;task analysis","smart contracts;time constraints;stipulate rules;mutually distrustful organizations;contractual agreements;blockchain;time intervalconstrained smart contract;execution accuracy measurements;local Ganache;Quorum;public Görli blockchains;Rinkeby Ethereum blockchains","","","","16","IEEE","27 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a cross-platform framework, called ExGen, to generate multiple transactions as exploits to given vulnerable smart contracts. ExGen first translates either Ethereum or EOS contracts to an intermediate representation (IR). Then, ExGen generates symbolic attack contracts with transactions in a partial order and then symbolically executes the attack contracts together with the target to find and solve all the constraints. Lastly, ExGen concretizes all the symbols, generates attack contracts with multiple transactions, and verifies the generated contracts’ exploitability on a private chain with values crawled from the public chain. We implemented a prototype of ExGen and evaluated it on Ethereum and EOS benchmarks. ExGen successfully exploits 1,258/1,399 (89.9%) Ethereum and 126/130 (96.9%) EOS vulnerabilities.

Many techniques based on symbolic execution, fuzzing, and static analysis are used to detect contract vulnerabilities. Most of the current analyzers only consider vulnerability detection intra-contract scenarios. However, Ethereum contracts usually interact with others by calling their functions. A bug hidden in a path that depends on information from external contract calls is defined as an inter-contract vulnerability. Failure to deal with this kind of bug can result in potential false negatives and false positives. In this work, we propose Pluto, which supports vulnerability detection in inter-contract scenarios. It first builds an Inter-contract Control Flow Graph (ICFG) to extract semantic information among contract calls. Afterward, it symbolically explores the ICFG and deduces Inter-Contract Path Constraints (ICPC) to check the reachability of execution paths more accurately. Finally, Pluto detects whether there is a vulnerability based on some predefined rules. For evaluation, we compare Pluto with five state-of-the-art tools, including Oyente, Mythril, Securify, ILF, and Clairvoyance on a labeled benchmark and 39,443 real-world Ethereum smart contracts. The result shows that other tools can only detect 10% of the inter-contract vulnerabilities, while Pluto can detect 80% of them on the labeled dataset. Beyond that, Pluto has detected 451 confirmed vulnerabilities on real-world contracts, including 36 vulnerabilities in inter-contract scenarios. Two bugs have been assigned with unique CVE identifiers by the US National Vulnerability Database (NVD). On average, Pluto costs 16.9 seconds to analyze a contract, which is as fast as the state-of-the-art tools.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2021.3117966","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9562567","Smart contracts;ethereum;inter-contract vulnerabilities","Pluto;Tools;Smart contracts;Semantics;Computer bugs;Codes;Virtual machining","blockchains;contracts;flow graphs;program debugging","contract calls;Ethereum smart contracts;ICFG;ICPC;Inter-contract Control Flow Graph;Inter-Contract Path Constraints;inter-contract vulnerability;Pluto;vulnerability detection","","1","","51","IEEE","7 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to a lack of transparency, the organisations need to trust that others comply with the agreements and regulations. We propose to exploit blockchain and smart contracts technologies to define an Attribute-Based Access Control System for cross-organisation medical records sharing, coined SmartAccess. SmartAccess offers joint agreement over access policies and dynamic access control besides blockchain transparency and auditability. We leverage the Attribute-Based Access Control model to implement smart contracts. We deploy and test them on a private and permissioned blockchain, transforming the access control process into a distributed smart contract execution. This paper proposes the SmartAccess system and its application in two healthcare use cases. We introduce the threat model and perform a security analysis of the system. To demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal, we implement a proof-of-concept of the smart contracts, written in Solidity language, with a size-efficient policy representation, and analyse the complexity and scalability of the contracts’ functions. Furthermore, we present performance results, measuring the latency and throughput of the transactions to execute the access control functions with different blockchain network consensus setups. We also compare the performance of the SmartAccess system against two open-source Solidity implementations of smart contract-based access control, Role-based Access Control and Access Control List. Finally, we discuss the strengths and drawbacks of our proposal. SmartAccess requires the overhead of a decentralised system, but the trade-off is transparency, regulation compliance and auditability for complex cross-organisation data sharing.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3217201","ASCLEPIOS: Advanced Secure Cloud Encrypted Platform for Internationally Orchestrated Solutions in Healthcare (European (EU) Research Project)(grant numbers:826093); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9930340","Attribute-based access control;blockchain;cross-organisation security;electronic medical records;GDPR;healthcare information system;smart contracts","Blockchains;Access control;Smart contracts;Peer-to-peer computing;Medical services;Process control;Data processing","authorisation;blockchains;contracts;electronic health records;health care","access control list;access policies;attribute-based access control model;blockchain transparency;coined SmartAccess;complex cross-organisation data sharing;cross-organisation medical records;decentralised system;distributed smart contract execution;dynamic access control;healthcare;permissioned blockchain;private blockchain;role-based access control;smart contract-based access control","","","","50","CCBY","26 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the existence of Byzantine nodes, existing mature concurrency control protocols in database cannot be employed directly, since the mechanism of executing smart contracts varies a lot. Furthermore, even though smart contract execution follows a two-phase style, i.e., the primary node executes a batch of smart contracts in the first phase and the validators replay them in the second phase, existing parallel solutions merely focus on the optimization for the first phase, rather than the second phase. In this paper, we propose a novel two-phase concurrency control protocol to optimize both phases for the first time. First, the primary executes transactions in parallel and generates a transaction dependency graph with high parallelism for validators. Then, a graph partition algorithm is devised to divide the original graph into several sub-graphs to preserve parallelism and reduce communication cost remarkably. Finally, we propose a deterministic replay protocol to re-execute the primary’s parallel schedule concurrently. Moreover, this two-phase protocol is further optimized by integrating with PBFT.

The occurrence of SPSs is originated from the vulnerability of the supervision mechanism on the blockchain. Although there are many excellent studies, these contributions overemphasized the methods themselves, did not describe the characteristics of the SPS well, and had certain limitations in practice. We made a thorough study on the characteristics of an SPS and brought out the vital features to identify an SPS for an investor. Based on the analysis of the contributions of predecessors, we propose an approach to test whether a contract is an SPS. This approach could deal with two situations, the contracts to be deployed and the long-run contracts respectively. Of the approach, the priori method can be exploited to distinguish whether the contract to be deployed is an SPS for the runner of a blockchain; the posterior method could protect an investor from being trapped in a fraud. At the same time, the posterior method can also be extended to monitor some contracts dynamically to alert users with the probability to be fallen into SPSs.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3178747","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9784909","Blockchain;digital currency;smart contract;smart Ponzi scheme","Contracts;Smart contracts;Blockchains;Codes;Investment;Feature extraction;Classification algorithms","blockchains;contracts;electronic money;fraud;investment;probability","long-run contracts;SPS;blockchain;posterior method;smart Ponzi scheme;financial Ponzi scheme;smart contract technology;supervision mechanism;probability;digital currency","","","","19","CCBY","30 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, subtle errors in smart contracts have induced an enormous financial loss—for examples, the DAO attack, Parity multisignature wallet attacks, and integer underflow/overflow attacks. To identify such errors in smart contracts, various researches are performed, which are based on static analysis and theorem proving. However, they only support inspection for pre-defined error patterns, or they cannot explore the whole searching space exhaustively or be fully automatic. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel formal verification technique to analyze blockchain smart contracts by using ATL model checking. In our methodology, we represent the interaction between users and smart contracts into a two-player game and verify properties we want to check using MCMAS that is an efficient ATL model checker for multi-agent systems.

Now, the e-voting system can be implemented in a decentralized manner by utilizing blockchain and smart contracts. This paper presents a comparative study of centralized and decentralized e-voting applications. This study gives an overview of the features offered by each application and analyzes the performance, security, usability, and user experience of each application. The analysis was obtained from simulations and questionnaires for each application carried out by two groups of respondents. The questionnaires were distributed using a simple randomization technique and then analyzed using tools provided by SUS. The results from security testing show that voting data in decentralized e-voting applications cannot be modified, while centralized ones can. Therefore, a decentralized e-voting application indicates the existence of a guarantee of the integrity of the stored data. However, there are still performance issues that are likely to be fixed in a near future.","","979-8-3503-9819-9","10.1109/ITIS57155.2022.10010100","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10010100","e-voting;blockchain;Ethereum;smart contract","Seminars;Analytical models;Smart contracts;User experience;Blockchains;Security;Electronic voting","blockchains;contracts;government data processing","blockchain;centralized e-voting application;decentralized e-voting application;decentralized electronic voting;Estonia;randomization technique;security testing;smart contracts;SUS;user experience","","","","21","IEEE","12 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, blockchain-enabled secure and trusted access control has attracted remarkable attention since it alleviates the centralization concern in traditional frameworks. However, existing designs only deal with access request validation problems whereas overlooks content delivery issues. Considering that radio resources are increasingly stretched with the rapid growth of IoT devices in the 5G era, this may give rise to unacceptably high latencies of legal requests in peak hours. This article addresses this limitation by presenting JCRA, a Joint Content and Radio Access control framework for IoT applications. JCRA deploys access point contracts (APCs) and device contracts (DCs) to manage radio access points (APs) and IoT devices, respectively. The atom access contract (AAC) is responsible for conducting access control according to access policies in DCs as well as radio resource states in APCs. To enable flexible radio resource management that often involves solving optimization models in AAC, we introduce a task offloading scheme, which recruits specialized executor nodes to complete the computation-heavy part off-chain. A Proof-of-Solution-Quality rule is proposed for executor solution validation which ensures the off-chain calculation is trusted. We implement a prototype of JCRA to demonstrate its feasibility. The costs and performance of JCRA are also evaluated in detail.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3163239","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB1803400); National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U21B2036); Scholarship from China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:CSC202106160076); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9745470","Access control;Proof-of-Solution-Quality (PoSQ);radio resource allocation;smart contract;task offloading","Access control;Blockchains;Smart contracts;Internet of Things;Task analysis;Optimization;Resource management","authorisation;contracts;Internet of Things;optimisation;radio access networks","Joint Content;smart-contract-based trusted framework;Internet of Things;traditional frameworks;access request validation problems;overlooks content delivery issues;radio resources;IoT devices;JCRA;Radio Access control framework;IoT applications;device contracts;radio access points;atom access contract;access policies;radio resource states;flexible radio resource management","","","","33","IEEE","30 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This article first investigates the taxonomy of security issues associated with smart contracts considering BIoT scenarios. To address these security concerns and overcome the limitations of existing methods, a tree-based machine learning vulnerability detection (TMLVD) method is proposed to perform the vulnerability analysis of smart contracts. TMLVD feeds the intermediate representations of smart contracts derived from abstract syntax trees (AST) into a tree-based training network for building the prediction model. Multidimensional features are captured by this model to identify smart contracts as vulnerable. The detection phase can be implemented quickly with limited computing resources and the accuracy of the detection results is guaranteed.

The RI is designed to evaluate the recyclability value of different plastic products based on their material compositions. The plastic credit, defined by the quantitative relation between the RI and product information, can be issued or traded by system stakeholders. Instead of setting rigid industry standards to regulate plastic quality, we construct a governance community among industry participants using blockchain-enabled smart contracts to self-regulate and monitor plastic production and trading. The proposed system is constructed on a consortium blockchain and a public blockchain to negotiate the RI, issue credits, and trade credits using smart contracts.

The massive device access in 5G networks further exacerbates the losses when problems occur. In light of it, we propose a decentralized fraud-proof roaming authentication framework based on blockchain.

In support of the hybrid transaction, blockchain oracle is an indispensable middleware responsible for receiving data-request tasks and pushing the result back to chain. Though solutions supporting hybrid transactions do exist, they are less featured or applicable for both contract and application developers. On one hand, the racing-condition among several concurrent hybrid transactions should be manually resolved by contract developers. On the other hand, application developers have to associate each individual task with its parent hybrid transaction in order to obtain the result. In this paper, a novel block-chain oracle platform with a set of simple but unified API for both hybrid and traditional transactions is proposed. Firstly, we design and implement a transactional storage layer and a transaction scheduler for transaction preservation and ordering. Secondly, with the help of an automatic result tracing mechanism, application developers are able to acquire transaction results transparently without awareness of oracles and underlying task execution. Experiments are conducted on one of current prevalent permissioned blockchain platforms, RepChain, and the result shows that all of the system design goals are fulfilled with merely an acceptable loss of performance.","","978-1-6654-6910-4","10.1109/CNIOT55862.2022.00010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9814760","Distributed blockchain oracle;Hybrid Smart Contract","Smart contracts;Blockchains;Internet of Things;Task analysis;Middleware","application program interfaces;blockchains;contracts;data mining;scheduling;transaction processing","transactional storage layer;transaction scheduler;transaction preservation;application developers;transaction results;underlying task execution;current prevalent permissioned blockchain platforms;transparent distributed oracle;hybrid smart contracts;application domain;off-chain data access;blockchain oracle;data-request tasks;concurrent hybrid transactions;contract developers;parent hybrid transaction;novel block-chain oracle platform;TransOra;transaction-preserving distributed oracle","","","","19","IEEE","7 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is because it relies on third-party services to produce tokens or OTPs, which leads to serious information leakage issues. Additionally, relying on a third party to provide authentication tokens significantly increases the risk of exposure and attacks, as tokens can be stolen via Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks.

Software invariants are logical assertions that a program fragment needs to remain faithful during execution and work well in defect detection. This paper studies the scarcity defect detection method of smart contract digital assets based on invariant analysis for the first time. First, we point out eight scarcity defects in three categories and describe their examples. Next, we propose two invariants—transfer invariant and swap invariant—that should be maintained in digital assets’ management and transaction process.

However, due to smart contract execution environment architectural defects, it is challenging for previous BC-AI systems to support computing-intensive tasks on-chain performing such as DNN convolution operations. They have to offload computations and a large amount of data from blockchain to off-chain platforms to execute smart contracts as native code. This failure to take advantage of data locality has become one of the major critical performance bottlenecks in BC-AI system. To this end, in this article, we propose SmartVM with optimization methods to support on-chain DNN inference for BC-AI system. The key idea is to design and optimize the computing mechanism and storage structure of smart contract execution environment according to the characteristics of DNN such as high computational parallelism and large data volume. We decompose SmartVM into three components: 1) a compact DNN-oriented instruction set to describe computations in a short number of instructions to reduce interpretation time. 2) a memory management mechanism to make SmartVM memory dynamic free/allocated according to the size of DNN feature maps. 3) a block-based weight prefetching and parallel computing method to organize each layer's computing and weights prefetching in a pipelined manner. We perform the typical image classification in a private Ethereum blockchain testbed to evaluate SmartVM performance. Experimental results highlight that SmartVM can support DNN inference on-chain with roughly the same efficiency against the native code execution. Compared with the traditional off-chain computing, SmartVM can speed up the overall execution by 70×, 16×, 11×, and 12× over LeNet5, AlexNet, ResNet18, and MobileNet, respectively. The memory footprint can be reduced by 84%, 90.8%, 94.3%, and 93.7% over the above four models, while offering the same level model accuracy.

However, the performance of blockchain-based systems in real-time grid monitoring and control has never been empirically tested. This study proposes implementing a decentralized voltage stability algorithm using blockchain-based smart contracts, as a testbed for evaluating the performance of blockchains in real-time control. We furthermore investigate sharding mechanisms as a means of improving the system's scalability with fixed computing resources. We implement our models as a proof-of-concept prototype system using Hyperledger Fabric as our blockchain platform, the Matpower library in MATLAB as our power system simulator, and Hyperledger Caliper as our performance evaluation tool. We found that sharding does indeed lead to a substantial improvement in system scalability for this domain, measured by both transaction success rates and transaction latency.","","978-1-6654-6104-7","10.1109/Blockchain55522.2022.00026","University of Alberta; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9881800","Blockchain;Decentralized Voltage Stability;Per-formance Evaluation;Sharding Mechanism","Distributed ledger;Scalability;Smart contracts;Power system stability;Stability analysis;Real-time systems;Blockchains","blockchains;contracts;decentralised control;peer-to-peer computing;power system control;power system dynamic stability;power system measurement;power system security;power system simulation;smart power grids","sharding technique;blockchain technologies;smart grid;system-level objectives;voltage stability protection;data immutability;traceability;blockchain-based systems;real-time grid monitoring;decentralized voltage stability algorithm;blockchain-based smart contracts;real-time control;sharding mechanisms;proof-of-concept prototype system;blockchain platform;power system simulator;performance evaluation tool;system scalability;scalable blockchain-based smart contract model","","1","","28","IEEE","19 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the important part of the smart contract, the task distribution algorithm is stored on the blockchain and run automatically. In the process of the task distribution, the cost of the task distribution and the system stability play a critical role. Therefore, the task distribution problem is formulated to minimize the cost of the task distribution whilst maintaining the stability of the system based on Lyapunov theorem.

With blockchain’s characteristic of immutability, they cannot be modified once deployed. Thus, the contract and the records are persisted on the blockchain forever, including failed transactions that are caused by runtime errors and result in the waste of computation, storage, and fees. In this paper, we refer to smart contracts which will cause runtime errors as crash-inducing smart contracts. However, automatic identification of crash-inducing smart contracts is limited investigated in the literature. The existing approaches to identify crash-inducing smart contracts are either limited in finding vulnerability (e.g., pattern-based static analysis) or very expensive (e.g., program analysis), which is insufficient for Ethereum.To reduce runtime errors on Ethereum, we propose an efficient, generalizable, and machine learning-based crash-inducing smart contract detector, CRASHSCDET, to automatically identify crash-inducing smart contracts. To investigate the effectiveness of CRASHSCDET, we firstly propose 34 static source code metrics from four dimensions (i.e., complexity metrics, count metrics, object-oriented metrics, and Solidity-specific metrics) to characterize smart contracts. Then, we collect a large-scale dataset of verified smart contracts (i.e., 54,739) and label these smart contracts based on their execution traces on Etherscan. We make a comprehensive comparison with three state-of-the-art approaches and the results show that CRASHSCDET can achieve good performance (i.e., 0.937 of F1-measure and 0.980 of AUC on average) and statistically significantly improve the baselines by 0.5%-60.4% in terms of F1-measure and by 41.2%-44.3% in terms of AUC, which indicates the effectiveness of static source code metrics in identifying crash-inducing smart contracts. We further investigate the importance of different types of metrics and find that metrics in different dimensions have varying abilities to depict the characteristic of smart contracts. Especially, metrics belonging to the ""Count"" dimension are the most discriminative ones but combining all metrics can achieve better prediction performance.","2640-7574","978-1-6654-5278-6","10.1109/SANER56733.2023.00020","Research and Development; National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Science Foundation; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10123502","Crash-inducing Smart Contract;Static Source Code Metric;Quality Assurance;Ethereum;Machine Learning","Measurement;Runtime;Source coding;Smart contracts;Detectors;Static analysis;Computer crashes","","","","","","56","IEEE","15 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this article, to model the corresponding interactions, we introduce a labor economics-based framework by exploiting the principles of contract theory, that jointly achieves the satisfaction of the various interacting system entities, i.e., the microgrid operator (MGO) and the prosumers. The MGO offers personalized rewards to the sellers and buyers, to incentivize them to sell and purchase energy, respectively. To provide a stable and efficient operation point, while aiming at jointly satisfying the profit and requirements of the involved competing parties, optimal personalized contracts, i.e., rewards and amount of sold/purchased energy, are determined, by formulating and solving contract-theoretic optimization problems between the MGO and the sellers or buyers.

Unfortunately, we cannot simply extrapolate those techniques to smart contracts. The major challenge is that smart contracts exhibit a nonuniform data access mode. Other than accessing the data via uniform addresses, smart contracts compromise multiple addressing modes, including flat address mode and key-value mode. More seriously, accessing a key-value table usually involves additional hash operations to obtain the keys. In this paper, we propose a DSE framework to resolve the nonuniform data access in smart contracts. More specifically, we exactly track the symbolic variables with concrete addresses and compute the actual/hash keys for table-like accesses. We also take the symbolic keys into account to distinguish data accesses incidentally with the same concrete keys resulting from artificially generated values. We describe the DSE framework in operational semantics. On top of the framework, we implement an integer overflow detector Nova and a multi-transactional vulnerability detector Mtvd. The experiments show that Nova outperforms state-of-the-art analysis tools in detecting the integer overflows with much higher precision and recall, 94.2 and 93.0 percent, respectively.

However, the prediction output needs verification for trust and reliability. Moreover, these algorithms suffer from the model's provenance to keep track of model updates and developments. Blockchain smart contracts provide a trustable ledger with consensus-based decisions that assure integrity and verifiability. In addition, the immutability feature of blockchain also supports the provenance of data that can help deep learning algorithms. Nevertheless, smart contract languages cannot predict due to the absence of floating-point operations required by activation functions of neural networks. In this paper, we derive a novel method using the Taylor series expansion to compute the floating-point equivalent output for activation functions. We train the deep learning model off-chain using a standard Python programming language. Moreover, we store models and predict on-chain with blockchain smart contracts to produce a trusted forecast. Our experiment and analysis achieved an accuracy (99%) similar to popular Keras Python library models for the MNIST dataset. Furthermore, any blockchain platform can reproduce the activation function using our derived method. Last but not least, other deep learning algorithms can reuse the mathematical model to predict on-chain.","","978-1-6654-9958-3","10.1109/BCCA55292.2022.9922240","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9922240","Deep-learning security;Blockchain;Smart Contract;Immutability;DApp;On-chain Prediction","Deep learning;Computational modeling;Smart contracts;Prediction algorithms;Taylor series;Mathematical models;Blockchains","blockchains;cognition;contracts;data integrity;deep learning (artificial intelligence);Python;series (mathematics);software libraries;trusted computing","blockchain;activation function;mathematical model;deep learning;cognitive intelligence;reliability;consensus-based decisions;smart contract languages;floating-point operations;floating-point equivalent output;Python programming language;Keras Python library;trustable ledger;immutability feature;data provenance;neural networks;Taylor series expansion;MNIST dataset;on-chain prediction","","","","76","IEEE","31 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Even though researchers have been dedicating substantial efforts in developing machine learning-based vulnerability detection models for Solidity smart contracts, the models achieved considerably lower accuracy due to shallow coverage of the feature space. In this paper, we introduce SmartMixModel, an improved vulnerability detection model considering an expanded feature space covering both the source- and byte-codes of the Solidity smart contracts. In particular, our contribution in this paper is threefold. First, we collect close to seventy thousand real-world Solidity smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum mainnet and employ the SmartCheck tool to label them considering ten types of vulnerabilities. Next, we generate a mixed-level embedding feature space considering both the high-level syntactic features of the source codes and the low-level features extracted from the compiled byte codes. Finally, we train various Machine Learning and Deep Learning models on our dataset balanced with SMOTETomek. We observe an improved detection performance compared to the state-of-the-art models, achieving the highest Micro-F1 of 98.34%, Macro-F1 of 98.20%, maximum F1-score rate of 99%, and maximum AUROC of 99.60% in the case of XGBoost classifier.","","978-1-6654-6104-7","10.1109/Blockchain55522.2022.00016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9881798","Blockchain;Smart Contract;Solidity;Vulnerability;Machine Learning","Deep learning;Solid modeling;Codes;Smart contracts;Syntactics;Feature extraction;Blockchains","feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;pattern classification;program compilers;security of data;text analysis","real-world Solidity smart contracts;mixed-level embedding feature space;machine learning-based vulnerability detection models;improved vulnerability detection model;expanded feature space","","4","","27","IEEE","19 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unfortunately, whether such an assumption truly holds in practice is still unknown.In this paper, we conduct, to the best of our knowledge, the first and most comprehensive large-scale empirical study of smart contract decompilers, to gain an understanding of the reliability, limitations, and remaining research challenges of state-of-the-art smart contract decompilation tools. We first designed and implemented a software prototype SOLINSIGHT, then used it to study 5 state-of-the-art smart contract decompilers. We obtained important findings and insights from empirical results, such as: 1) we proposed 3 root causes leading to decompiler failures; 2) we revealed 2 reasons hurting performance; 3) we identified 3 root causes affecting decompilation effectiveness; 4) we proposed a measurement metric for completeness; and 5) we investigated the resilience of contract decompilers against program transformations. We suggest that: 1) decompiler builders should enhance decompilers in terms of effectiveness, performance, and completeness; and 2) security researchers should select appropriate decompilers based on the suggestions in this study. We believe these findings and suggestions will help decompiler builders, contract developers, and security researchers, by providing better guidelines for contract decompiler studies.","2640-7574","978-1-6654-5278-6","10.1109/SANER56733.2023.00011","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10123564","Empirical study;Smart contracts;Decompilation","Measurement;Source coding;Smart contracts;Reverse engineering;Prototypes;Reliability engineering;Software","","","","","","89","IEEE","15 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since the smart contract is immutable once deployed, developers must try their best to fix existing vulnerabilities in advance to ensure security. Current approaches for automatic program repair on the smart contracts have mainly adopted the heuristic search algorithms or defined patterns to fix several well-defined types of vulnerabilities. They can only provide security code recommendations for developers in specific scenarios. We explore more general automated program repair of smart contracts in software history.To pave the way for studying code changes related to bug fix of smart contracts in software history, we present a labeled public dataset for method-level program repair task, containing over 12 typical insecure code patterns. Unlike bugs in traditional software, the vulnerabilities of smart contracts are more associated with access control and conditional statements as smart contracts pertain to financial assets. For this problem, we devise a novel double-encoder network and use a code representation designed for the smart contract based on syntax information to repair program.

A lot of works have been done to design an effective computational resource market for IoT, but the problems of vulnerability and inefficiency still exist. In this article, we propose a two-level Stackelberg game-based computing resource trading mechanism for mobile IoT devices with a credit-based payment approach, which is implemented by smart contracts on blockchain. In our model, the Stackelberg game consists of two levels, i.e., leader-level and user-level. In the leader-level, the computing service provider (CSP) and its agent constitute a composite leader. The agent purchases computing resource from CSP on credit and acts as a broker among leader-level and user-level reselling these computing resources to users. In the user-level, every user experiences social externality, which means users are interdependent. The leader-level subgame makes credit payment easier by making loaning and trading become a joint credit payment. The user-level subgame makes the market more active and closer to reality by introducing social externality. Besides, smart contracts can prevent malicious behaviors such as delay payment. We also conduct equilibrium analysis and prove the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium in our Stackelberg game-based model. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to evaluate the cost of smart contracts and the performance of each entity with the proposed pricing mechanism.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2020.3024729","National Key Research and Development Plan(grant numbers:2018YFB1003803); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61802450,61722214,61976061); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018A030313005); Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Entrepreneurial Teams(grant numbers:2017ZT07X355); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9200703","Computing resource trading;edge-cloud computing;Stackelberg game;social externality;smart contract;mobile blockchain","Contracts;Computational modeling;Resource management;Games;Internet of Things","cloud computing;credit transactions;game theory;Internet of Things;mobile computing;pricing;purchasing;resource allocation","IoT computational resource trading mechanism;smart contract approach;increasing computation-intensive applications;edge computing;mobile devices;low-latency tasks;effective computing resource allocation mechanism;secure computing resource allocation mechanism;effective computational resource market;two-level Stackelberg game-based;mobile IoT devices;credit-based payment approach;smart contracts;computing service provider;composite leader;agent purchases computing resource;user-level reselling these computing resources;leader-level subgame;joint credit payment;user-level subgame;Stackelberg game-based model;pricing mechanism","","4","","34","IEEE","18 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, we present RNVulDet – a tool that incorporates taint analysis techniques to automatically identify bad randomness vulnerabilities and detect corresponding attack transactions. To extensively verify the effectiveness of RNVulDet, we construct three new datasets: i) 34 well-known contracts that are reported to possess bad randomness vulnerabilities, ii) 214 popular contracts that have been rigorously audited before launch and are regarded as free of bad randomness vulnerabilities, and iii) a dataset consisting of 47,668 smart contracts and 49,951 suspicious transactions.

Ethereum is a decentralized platform that incorporates several interactions, not limited to asset trading only; it is also a platform of smart contracts execution and token trading. In this work, we aim at reflecting the interactions perceived in the Ethereum network on Ether prices using Topological Data Analysis (TDA).

In this article, we study the evolutionary behavior of Ethereum transactions from a temporal graph point of view. We first develop a data analytic platform to collect external transactions associated with users as well as internal transactions initiated by smart contracts. Three types of temporal graphs, user-to-user, contract-to-contract, and user-contract graphs, are constructed according to trading relationships and are segmented with an appropriate time window. We observe a strong correlation between the size of the user-to-user transaction graph and the average Ether price in a time window, while no evidence of such linkage is shown at the average degree, average edge weights, and average triplet closure duration. The macroscopic and microscopic burstiness of Ethereum transactions are validated.

These systems have been leveraging Smart Contracts (SCs) to add trust and transparency to their criteria. However, deploying fixed allocation criteria in SCs does not necessarily lead to the best performance over time since the blockchain participants join and leave flexibly, and their load varies with time, making the original allocation sub-optimal. Furthermore, updating the criteria manually at every variation in the blockchain jeopardizes the autonomous and independent execution promised by SCs. Thus, we propose a set of light-weight agents for SCs that are capable of optimizing the performance. We also propose using online learning SCs, empowered by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent, that leverage the chained data to continuously self-tune its allocation criteria. We show that the proposed learning-assisted method achieves superior performance on the combinatorial multi-stage allocation problem while still being executable in real-time. We also compare the proposed approach with standard heuristics as well as planning methods. Results show a significant performance advantage over heuristics and better adaptability to the dynamic nature of blockchain networks.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2021.3118970","Qatar National Research Fund(grant numbers:#NPRP12S-0305-190231); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9573346","IoT;blockchain;smart contracts;service provisioning;deep reinforcement learning;edge computing","Blockchains;Resource management;Costs;Task analysis;Peer-to-peer computing;Vehicle dynamics;Smart contracts","blockchains;contracts;deep learning (artificial intelligence);quality of experience;reinforcement learning;resource allocation;software agents","deep reinforcement learning agent;Quality of Experience;smart agents;fixed allocation criteria;blockchain participants;transparency;Smart Contracts;operation cost;optimal trade-off;service provisioning systems;blockchain-powered systems;blockchain networks;multistage allocation problem;learning-assisted method;online learning SCs;light-weight agents;independent execution;autonomous execution","","8","","40","IEEE","14 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such legal agreements are crucial to effectively manage ownership and protect the rights of involved parties. Today’s software licensing mechanisms are mostly centralized and do not address the ever-increasing issues and complexities of modern software that may include multiple licenses, open-source distribution, rewarding other contributors of external software libraries, and utilizing royalty payments for monetization. As a result, developers have lost confidence in the existing software licensing models, and many software projects are failing due to lack of funding and royalty payments. This paper addresses such issues and complexities by proposing a novel decentralized software licensing system based on Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and blockchain. The proposed licensing system is applicable to both commercial and open-source software. We use NFTs as digital tokens that encapsulate software code and their artifacts by minting them as unique valuable assets that allow developers to store and manage them on a blockchain ledger. With NFTs, developers can register and license their code, monetize it on NFT marketplaces, and earn royalties from other software projects that use their code. We present system architecture, relevant sequence diagrams, and develop aggregation algorithms for Ethereum smart contracts with ERC-1155 NFTs. Furthermore, we perform functional validation of our system and analyze the cost of its adoption. We also analyze the security of the solution and show how its applicability can be generalized and extended.

We test 27 detection tools, and analyze them from several perspectives, including the capability of detecting a smart contract version. Finally, it is concluded that most of the current vulnerability detection tools can only detect vulnerabilities in a single and old version of smart contracts. Although the deep learning method detects fewer types of smart contract vulnerabilities, it has higher detection accuracy and efficiency.

The proposed study involves four different stages like image acquisition, encryption, optimal key generation, secured storing. The input images initially are collected in the image acquisition stage. Then, the collected medical images are encrypted using coupled map lattice (CML). This encryption process assists to preserve the input medical images from the attackers. In order to provide more confidentiality to the encrypted images, optimal keys are generated using opposition-based sparrow search optimization (O-SSO) algorithm. These encrypted images are stored using distributed ledger technology (DLT) and smart contract based blockchain technology. This blockchain technology enhances the data integrity and authenticity and allows secured transmission of medical images. After decrypting the image, the disease is diagnosed in the classification stage using proposed Recurrent Generative Neural Network (RGNN) model.

Finally, based on the results of this analysis, we use the blockchain-based smart contract technology to dynamically adjust the participation benefits of users under different conditions in order to promote users to join consortium blockchains more often and steadily to participate in model training for federated learning and obtain better model accuracy. Our work is the first to apply the evolutionary game theory to the study of incentives in federated learning, and plays a leading role in the study of incentives in federated learning. Experimental simulation validation shows that our DIM-DS model can adequately motivate users to participate in the collaborative task of data sharing and maintain stability. The model can maximize the effectiveness of the federated learning model.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3191671","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072319,61772352,62172061); Science and Technology on Communication Security Laboratory(grant numbers:6142103190415); Sichuan Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:2022YFG0041,2019YFG0184,2019JDTD0001,2022YFG0155,2022YFG0157,2021GFW019,2021YFG0152,2021YFG0025,2020YFG0322); Luzhou Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:2021CDLZ-11); National Key Research and Development Project(grant numbers:2020YFB1711800,2020YFB1707900); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9831779","Data sharing;dynamic incentive model;evolutionary game theory;federated learning;smart contracts","Collaborative work;Data models;Game theory;Games;Blockchains;Analytical models;Smart contracts","evolutionary computation;game theory;incentive schemes;learning (artificial intelligence)","big data;blockchain-based smart contract technology;data sharing;data-sharing process;data-sharing transactions;dynamic incentive model;evolutionary game theory;federated learning model;incentives","","","","26","IEEE","18 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Blockchain was first used in 2009 in the infrastructure of the financial sector of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Recently, further applications have evolved in this area to provide decentralized transaction storage by employing innovative mechanisms that enable decentralized operation. This mechanism is called a smart contract that operates based on individually defined rules (e.g., quality, quantity, and price specifications) that enable an independent matching of market players at the distribution level on the supplier side and their potential customers and end-users as well as prosumers. In this article, in addition to introducing the concept of Blockchain, the way this cutting-edge technology deals with different agents in the energy sector and markets and its impact on the operation performance of the electricity and energy industry have been examined. Thus, merging other emerging technologies and platforms, such as big data analysis, the Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI) with Blockchain, can solve many practical open challenges in smart electrical grids and the energy domain.

In such scenarios, Nausica@DApp, the comprehensive solution proposed in this paper, eases compatibility of the in-presence activities of a campus-based corporation with the organizational constraints posed by the virus during the pandemic, or at a later endemic stage. This is accomplished throughout several intervention areas, such as personnel contact tracing, crowd gathering surveillance, and epidemiological monitoring. These operational requirements, in particular indirect contact tracing and overcrowd monitoring, call for the adoption of an absolute device localization paradigm, which, in the proposed solution, has been devised on top of the campus WiFi infrastructure, proving to be encouragingly accurate in most cases. Absolute localization, on the other hand, entails a certain amount of server-based centralized operations, which might affect the preservation of user data privacy. The novelty of the proposed solution consists in maximizing confidentiality and integrity in the handling of sensitive personal information, in spite of the centralized aspects of the localization system. This is accomplished by decentralizing contact tracing matching operations, which are entirely carried out locally, by apps running on the users’ mobile devices. Contact data are pseudonymized and their authenticity is guaranteed by a blockchain. Furthermore, the proposed novel solution improves privacy preservation by eschewing recourse to the Bluetooth app-to-app channel for user data exchange, in fact a typical choice of most current contract tracing solutions. Thanks to a sensible use of the blockchain features, integrated into Nausica@DApp’s microservice-based back-end, a higher degree of operation transparency can be relied upon, thus boosting the user’s level of trust and enhancing the availability and reliability of data about people gathering within the campus premises. Moreover, contact tracing only requires the mobile device WiFi interface to be on, so that users are neither forced to adopt new habits, nor to grant additional device access permissions to contact tracing apps (potentially undermining their own privacy). The overall system has been analysed in terms of performance and costs, and the experiments have shown that its adoption is viable and effective.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3208167","Project TEAMS—TEchniques to Support the Analysis of Big Data in Medicine, Energy and Structures—Piano di incentivi per la ricerca di Ateneo 2020/2022; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9895418","Blockchain;contact tracing;data analysis;decentralized apps;distributed systems;epidemiological surveillance;localization;mobile applications;smart contracts","Blockchains;Smart contracts;Peer-to-peer computing;Surveillance;Location awareness;Pandemics;Data privacy;Data analysis;Epidemiology;Smart contracts","blockchains;data privacy;diseases;epidemics;mobility management (mobile radio);surveillance;wireless LAN","campus premises;mobile device WiFi interface;decentralized solution;epidemiological surveillance;campus scenarios;containment phases;Covid-19;digital tools;social working interactions;campus-based corporation;organizational constraints;endemic stage;intervention areas;personnel contact tracing;crowd gathering surveillance;epidemiological monitoring;operational requirements;overcrowd monitoring;absolute device localization paradigm;campus WiFi infrastructure;server-based centralized operations;user data privacy;confidentiality;sensitive personal information;centralized aspects;localization system;contact tracing matching operations;contact data;privacy preservation;Bluetooth app-to-app channel;user data exchange;blockchain features;operation transparency;device access permissions;contract tracing solutions;Nausica@DApp;microservice-based back-end","","","","30","CCBY","20 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Attackers launch front-running attacks by inserting additional transactions before upcoming victim transactions to manipulate victim transaction executions and make profits. Recent studies have shown that front-running attacks are prevalent on the Ethereum blockchain and have caused millions of US dollars loss. It is the vulnerabilities in smart contracts, which are blockchain programs invoked by transactions, that enable the front-running attack opportunities. Although techniques to detect front-running vulnerabilities have been proposed, their performance on real-world vulnerable contracts is unclear. There is no large-scale benchmark based on real attacks to evaluate their capabilities. We make four contributions in this paper. First, we design an effective algorithm to mine real-world attacks in the blockchain history. The evaluation shows that our mining algorithm is more effective and comprehensive, achieving higher recall in finding real attacks than the previous study. Second, we propose an automated and scalable vulnerability localization approach to localize code snippets in smart contracts that enable front-running attacks. The evaluation also shows that our localization approaches are effective in achieving higher precision in pinpointing vulnerabilities compared to the baseline technique. Third, we build a benchmark consisting of 513 real-world attacks with vulnerable code labeled in 235 distinct smart contracts, which is useful to help understand the nature of front-running attacks, vulnerabilities in smart contracts, and evaluate vulnerability detection techniques. Last but not least, we conduct an empirical evaluation of seven state-of-the-art vulnerability detection techniques on our benchmark. The evaluation experiment reveals the inadequacy of existing techniques in detecting front-running vulnerabilities, with a low recall of $\leq$ 6.04%. Our further analysis identifies four common limitations in existing techniques: lack of support for inter-contract analysis, inefficient constraint solving for cryptographic operations, improper vulnerability patterns, and lack of token support.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2023.3270117","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10108045","Benchmark;dataset;empirical study;ethereum;front-running;smart contract;vulnerability;blockchain","Smart contracts;Benchmark testing;Blockchains;Codes;History;Relays;Location awareness","","","","","","","IEEE","25 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Due to the lack of inter-organization synergy and because of privacy concerns, authentic financial transaction data is rarely available. On the other hand, data-driven technologies like machine learning need authentic data to perform precisely in real-world systems. This study proposes a blockchain and smart contract-based approach to achieve robust Machine Learning (ML) algorithm for e-commerce fraud detection by facilitating inter-organizational collaboration. The proposed method uses blockchain to secure the privacy of the data. Smart contract deployed inside the network fully automates the system. An ML model is incrementally upgraded from collaborative data provided by the organizations connected to the blockchain. To incentivize the organizations, we have introduced an incentive mechanism that is adaptive to the difficulty level in updating a model. The organizations receive incentives based on the difficulty faced in updating the ML model. A mining criterion has been proposed to mine the block efficiently. And finally, the blockchain network is tested under different difficulty levels and under different volumes of data to test its efficiency. The model achieved 98.93% testing accuracy and 98.22% Fbeta score (recall-biased f measure) over eight incremental updates. Our experiment shows that both data volume and difficulty level of blockchain impacts the mining time. For difficulty level less than five, mining time and difficulty level has a positive correlation. For difficulty level two and three, less than a second is required to mine a block in our system. Difficulty level five poses much more difficulties to mine the blocks.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3198956","Faculty Research, North South University, Bashundhara, Dhaka 1229, Bangladesh(grant numbers:CTRG-21-SEPS-19); Foundation of Economic Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9857827","Blockchain;collaborative machine learning;incremental learning;privacy;smart contract","Blockchains;Machine learning;Smart contracts;Adaptation models;Data models;Smart contracts;Computational modeling;Collaboration;Financial industry","data analysis;data mining;data privacy;electronic commerce;financial data processing;fraud;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","machine learning;privacy-preserving;adaptive incentive;financial fraud cases;current technological advancements;inter-organization synergy;privacy concerns;authentic financial transaction data;data-driven technologies;authentic data;real-world systems;smart contract-based approach;robust Machine;e-commerce fraud detection;inter-organizational collaboration;ML model;collaborative data;organizations;incentive mechanism;incentives;blockchain network;different difficulty levels;98.93% testing accuracy;incremental updates;data volume;mining time","","","","72","CCBY","16 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Towards this goal, we study a blockchain-aided EC market wherein each data service operator (DSO) rents a group of edge computing nodes (ECNs) and leases the ECNs to the user terminals (UTs) to provide computation offloading services. A trustworthiness model is introduced to evaluate the quality of each network entity throughout the transactions. We develop a two-level trading mechanism over smart contract to enable the automatic and efficient transactions among the network entities and provide high quality services. First, we propose a smart contract based matching mechanism to establish the renting association between the DSOs and ECNs with the aim of maximizing the social welfare. Second, we propose a social welfare improved double auction (SWIDA) mechanism to build up the leasing association between the DSOs and UTs, and determine the pricing of the winners. We show that the proposed double auction mechanism can achieve individual rationality, balanced budget, truthfulness in expectation, and an improved social welfare than the benchmark mechanisms. Moreover, we put forth a trustworthiness driven Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism to enable verified transaction and fair allocation of block generation reward. Following the principle of PoS, we formulate the block generation as a coalitional game, wherein each stakeholder votes according to its trustworthiness and coinage, and shares the reward among the coalition according to the Shapley values. The simulation results show that the proposed PoS consensus mechanism can reduce the wealth inequality among the network entities compared with the conventional consensus mechanisms.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2021.3140080","National Key Project(grant numbers:2020YFB1807700); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20210331); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872184); Tomsk Polytechnic University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9669057","Edge computing;blockchain;smart contract;matching;double auction;proof-of-stake;Shapley value","Blockchains;Smart contracts;Task analysis;Edge computing;Resource management;Computer science;Computational modeling","","","","4","","39","IEEE","4 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Despite some academic effort, TrustZone can only support limited languages for now. The lack of the corresponding execution environment for smart contracts seriously hinders blockchain applications from directly running on TrustZone. In this paper, we design the first virtual execution environment named TSC-VEE for performing Solidity smart contracts on TrustZone, to the best of our knowledge. TSC-VEE can be decomposed into fourfold: (1) an instruction set adapted to the isolation and world switching mechanism of TrustZone. (2) a runtime memory management mechanism that provides a pair of instructions with the corresponding processing mechanism to allocate and release the work memory. (3) a hybrid granularity resource analysis algorithm which computes and records the value of maximum stack height and static gas cost through bytecode pre-execution, avoiding runtime overflow and invalid computations. (4) a cross-isolation-environment prefetching approach that supports loading and storing the storage data from the normal world into the secure world on TrustZone before execution, thus avoiding switching the world state frequently at runtime. Extensive experimental results show that TSC-VEE can perform smart contracts correctly and efficiently on TrustZone. Compared with the most commonly used Ethereum client—Geth, TSC-VEE achieves execution performance improvements by $9.29\times$9.29×. We also implement the Ethereum virtual machine—evmone on TrustZone. TSC-VEE can reduce the latency by 12.63% with our optimization techniques, and decrease the work memory footprint by 22.95% on average when executing various scale contracts.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2023.3263882","CCF-AFSG Research Fund(grant numbers:CCF-AFSG RF20210031); CCF-Huawei Populus Grove Fund(grant numbers:CCF-HuaweiTC2022005); National Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:62002175); Open Project Fund of State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture; Institute of Computing Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:CARCHB202016); Open Project Foundation of Information Security Evaluation Center of Civil Aviation; Civil Aviation University of China(grant numbers:ISECCA-202102); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10094016","Blockchain;smart contract;solidity program language;TrustZone;virtual execution environment","Smart contracts;Blockchains;Memory management;Switches;Codes;Public key;Optimization","","","","","","44","IEEE","6 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In recent years, many market players have experienced long-term planning problems, which incur staggering costs to the grids. Investing in the electricity industry is a long-term investment and the investor will suffer heavy losses in the case of inappropriate forecasting and lack of elaborated management. Hence, the investors should be so encouraged through incentives and tariff determination policies that a convincing level of reliability is achieved. Furthermore, the investment costs and maintenance costs should be recovered by the revenue earned from well-thought-out tariffs. Tariffs also send economic signals to price-elastic loads that help to shape the consumption pattern of end-users and change the demand curve, particularly for peak clipping and valley filling. In a restructured environment, the electricity tariffs have hourly or intra-hour volatilities. These variations are triggered by various uncertainties. The uncertainty in tariffs is not desired by the customers. The improvement in the predictability of tariffs mitigates the risk for market players as well as end-users for profitability and portfolio management. Such improvements and risk mitigations can be maintained by some financial means, known as hedging means, such as call/put option contracts, contract for difference agreements, long-term future or forward contracts, diversification and liquidity improvement in markets, insurance and arbitrage diminution rules, etc. In this paper, a new tariffs volatility reduction technique using risk management approaches and long-term contracts for restructured power systems is proposed. Bilateral long-term contracts will arguably alleviate risk fluctuations in investment and subsequently market prices in the long term. In order to solve this problem and its economic facets, long-term bilateral hedge contracts for the control of long-term uncertainty are integrated into the model. In the proposed method by designing long-term contracts deploying economic financing paradigms and optimal decision-making schemes, the role of long-term hedge contracts in reducing general tariff costs and instability by incorporating GAMS software on the Iran National Grid (ING) has been investigated.","2642-9527","978-1-6654-8087-1","10.1109/ICEE55646.2022.9827414","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9827414","Risk management policies;Bilateral hedge contracts;Electricity tariffs;Deregulated and restructured markets;Uncertainty diminution rules","Electrical engineering;Costs;Uncertainty;Shape;Profitability;Tariffs;Software","contracts;decision making;investment;optimisation;power markets;power system economics;power system management;power system planning;pricing;risk analysis;tariffs","electrical engineering electricity tariff volatility mitigation;uncertainty-diminution;risk management policies;restructured power systems;traditional grid management;deregulated management;controllability;quantitative risk assessment;market players;long-term planning problems;electricity industry;long-term investment;elaborated management;investor;tariff determination policies;investment costs;maintenance costs;electricity tariffs;intra-hour volatilities;profitability;portfolio management;long-term future;liquidity improvement;tariffs volatility reduction technique;risk management approaches;long-term contracts;risk fluctuations;long-term bilateral hedge contracts;long-term uncertainty;general tariff costs","","","","29","IEEE","20 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To achieve high operation efficiency, it is important to enable the data sharing and cooperative computation among different parties. How to protect the security and privacy of the utility data and the identities of their owners has become a major concern. There have been some studies on this issue. However, most of these works failed to consider the privacy protection in the dual sides of the data owner and receiver. In this article, we propose BPM4SG, a blockchain-based dual-side privacy-preserving multiparty computation (MPC) scheme for edge-enabled smart grid. In BPM4SG, the data segmentation method is adopted to ensure the security of MPC (e.g., summation) in edge nodes. The consortium blockchain and smart contract are used to further increase the system security and avoid the dependency on trusted third parties. Additionally, a data obfuscation method based on the ring signatures and a new one-time address scheme are proposed to protect the privacy of both the data owner and data receiver. The analysis shows that BPM4SG can meet the security and privacy requirements of smart grid.

The need for data protection and data sharing in this transition makes blockchain with chain information systems able to provide additional security in access control of medical records. In this research, we explores and analyzes the need for integrating and managing Personal Health Records from patient medical records, by implementing the technology of blockchain. Accompanied by a NoSQL database system, the design of a system to perform patient-centered-based medical record management can be initiated using smartphones as the media. The results of the analysis were developed in the form of the myHealth Medical Record Management application covering 4 categories of the user interface. The application was developed in Flutter Framework alongside Google Firebase as an authenticator and database provider, combined with a connection to an Ethereum-based blockchain client running on a virtual machine.

In addition, to securely update, validate, and store the trust information, we propose a hierarchical blockchain framework that comprises vehicular blockchain, roadside unit (RSU) blockchain, and cloud blockchain.

However, if the authorization logic of token contract is flawed implementation, the holder of token will suffer tremendous financial losses. In this work, we detect the authentication implementation of the flaws in ERC20 token, which has not been done before. We find the authentication process of the token is implemented by operating the authentication data structure of the token. Therefore, we capture the operations of the authentication data structure in token contract to infer authentication behaviors and detect authentication defects. However, it’s not a simple task as most smart contracts are not open source and the bytecode of token contract lacks type information. To tackle these problems, we utilize symbolic execution on the token bytecode, then identify the authentication data structure and capture the operations by parsing the symbolic expressions, and finally detect authentication defects through the inferred authentication behavior. To best our knowledge, this is the first work to detect the flaws in the implementation of authentication in ERC20 Token. To automate the analysis, we implement our approach in a new tool named TokenCat and use it to inspect 245,822 tokens.

State-of-the-art techniques to secure manufacturing processes mostly rely on watermarking, which embeds hidden information inside CAD models to prove ownership and authenticity. Nevertheless, such techniques tamper with the model itself, while existing attacks allow removing such watermarks altogether. To address these shortcomings, we integrate signal processing and cryptographic techniques and describe a tailored solution for CAD model ownership and supply chain management. Our approach generates unique identifiers for 3D designs using frequency-domain transforms and employs non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that persist on public distributed ledgers. Our NFTs are implemented on the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts and their functionality is twofold: (a) authenticate the owner of a CAD model, and (b) enable ownership transfer.

The overproducation and underconsumption are usually due to the lack of accountability, transparency, traceability, audit, assessment, security, and trust features in the current healthcare supply chain systems. It is required to ensure that everyone is getting a fair share of medical supplies without unnecessary waste. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution that ensures the commitment and accountability of all participants to prevent them from producing any unnecessary waste. We introduce five phases, such as registration, commitment, production, delivery, and consumption, to perform the waste assessment accurately and fairly. We develop four smart contracts that ensure data provenance, transparency, security, and accountability while recording all actions on an immutable ledger automatically. We utilize offchain decentralized storage to deal with the large data problem. We present five algorithms and discuss each phase of the proposed solution, along with their full implementation, testing, and validation details. We conduct the security analysis to ensure that our smart contracts are secure enough and they do not have vulnerabilities and flaws.

The communication technologies allow one IoT device to discover and communicate with another in order to exchange services, in a similar way to what humans do in their social networks. Knowing the reputation of another device is important to consider whether it is trustworthy before establishing a new connection and thus, avoid possible unexpected behaviors as a consequence. Trustworthiness, as a property of a device, can be affected by different factors including its geographical location. Hence, this research work proposes an architecture to manage reputation values of end devices in an IoT system based on the area where they are located. A cloud–fog–edge architecture is proposed, where the fog layer uses the Blockchain technology to keep the reputation management system consistent and fault tolerant across different nodes. The location-based part of the system was done by storing geographical areas in smart contracts (coined as geospatial smart contracts) and making the reputation values subject to different regions depending on the geographical location of the device. To reduce the complexity of the spatial computation, the geographical data are geocoded by either one of two different spatial indexing techniques. This work also introduced two different structures for storing geocoded areas based on either cell list or tree structure. Finally, three experiments to test the proposed architecture are presented, to deploy the architecture in IoT devices, and to compare the two geocoding techniques in smart contracts.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3147478","TRUST4IoE Project of the Programa Estatal de Proyectos de I+D de Generación de Conocimiento of the Spanish Government(grant numbers:PID2019-104065GA-I00); Postdoctoral Juan de la Cierva Fellowship Programme of the Spanish Ministry for Science and Innovation(grant numbers:IJC2018-035017-I); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9697067","Blockchain;Internet of Things (IoT);location-based trust;spatial indexing","Computer architecture;Blockchains;Cloud computing;Internet of Things;Smart contracts;Indexing;Geospatial analysis","blockchains;cloud computing;contracts;distributed processing;fault tolerant computing;Internet of Things;location based services;telecommunication network management;trees (mathematics);trusted computing","geographical location;IoT system;cloud-fog-edge architecture;fog layer;Blockchain technology;fault tolerant;geographical areas;geospatial smart contracts;geographical data;spatial indexing techniques;geocoded areas;IoT device;decentralized location-based reputation management system;communication technologies;social networks;location-based part of the system;geocoding techniques;smart contracts","","7","","26","IEEE","31 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nevertheless, because of potential security and privacy protection arising from trustless energies trading, how to make such energies trading go smoothly is a tricky challenge. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based multiple energies trading (B-MET) system for secure and efficient energies trading by executing a smart contract we design. Because energies trading requires the blockchain in B-MET system to have high throughput and low latency, we design a new byzantine-based consensus mechanism (BCM) based on node’s credit to improve efficiency for the consortium blockchain under the B-MET system. Then, we take combined heat and power (CHP) system as a typical example that provides distributed energies. We quantify their utilities and model the interactions between aggregators and DESs in a smart city by a novel multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game. It is analyzed and solved by reaching Nash equilibrium between aggregators, which reflects the competition between aggregators to purchase energies from DESs. In the end, we conduct plenty of numerical simulations to evaluate and verify our proposed model and algorithms, which demonstrate their correctness and efficiency completely.","2473-2400","","10.1109/TGCN.2022.3142438","Start-Up Fund from BNU at Zhuhai(grant numbers:310432104); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1747818,1907472); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9678970","Distributed energies trading;Smart city;consortium blockchain;byzantine consensus;Stackelberg game","Blockchains;Games;Smart cities;Cogeneration;Resistance heating;Security;Throughput","blockchains;cogeneration;contracts;distributed power generation;game theory;numerical analysis;power markets;smart cities","distributed energies trading;smart city;distributed network;distributed energy stations;smart aggregators;privacy protection;blockchain-based multiple energies trading system;smart contract;B-MET system;byzantine-based consensus mechanism;consortium blockchain;DES;BCM;combined heat and power system;CHP;multileader multifollower Stackelberg game;Nash equilibrium;numerical simulations","","6","","35","IEEE","12 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Gas measures the cost of performing specific operations as an index designed to quantify the computing power consumption. Existing unoptimized smart contracts make contract developers and users spend extra gas. To save gas and optimize smart contracts, this paper proposes a new tool named GaSaver for automatically detecting gas-expensive patterns based on Solidity source code. Specifically, we first identify 12 gas-expensive patterns in smart contracts and classify them into three categories: storage-related, judgment-related, and loop-related. Then, we deploy gas-expensive patterns and group them into three levels according to gas waste degree. By conducting extensive experiments on real data sets, we find that 89.68% of the 1172 smart contracts suffer from gas-expensive patterns, 94.27% of 1100 new smart contracts are gas-expensive, and 80.56% of 72 widely used smart contracts are affected. Finally, the experiment results show that the proposed GaSaver can effectively optimize smart contracts. Besides, the proportion of gas-expensive cases in widely used smart contracts is lower than that in the newly released smart contracts.","2377-3782","","10.1109/TSUSC.2022.3221444","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9946440","Code optimization;gas-expensive pattern;smart contract;solidity;static analysis","Source coding;Smart contracts;Blockchains;Codes;Optimization;Costs;Estimation","","","","","","","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The primary contribution is the integration of two popular cloud technologies within the Blockchain: Docker, a scalable platform to run applications in lightweight environments, and Cloud Storage. Each process available in the platform requires input files and produces output files by using cloud storage as a repository and it is delivered by the owner as a self-contained Docker image, whose digest is safely stored in the chain.

However, PHRs have recently been plagued by security issues, such as the leakage of personal health information, illegal access to patient data, and data tampering. Recent security developments, such as introducing an access control policy with attribute-based encryption (ABE) or utilizing blockchain, have only been partially successful in solving these issues. Ongoing challenges to PHR sharing include single points of failure, node cheating attacks, and fair keyword search issues. In this article, we tackle these challenges by introducing a distributed PHR-sharing scheme based on blockchain and ciphertext policy ABE (CP-ABE), which allows for fast and efficient encryption and decryption. Blockchain maintains the integrity and the tracing source of the data while also recording all operations on the data in the form of transactions. In addition, the blockchain nodes act as attribute authorities to construct the CP-ABE cryptosystem. The tracing of malicious blockchain nodes is realized by tracing cryptography algorithms. Furthermore, the fair retrieval of ciphertext is achieved by employing smart contracts. To overcome the limited storage capacity of blockchain, we adopt both the on-chain and off-chain storage modes in our new system. Security analysis indicates that our new scheme remains intact when threatened by an indistinguishable chosen plaintext attack (IND-CPA) and an indistinguishable chosen keywords attack (IND-CKA). As such, we conclude that our proposed approach is feasible and efficient.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3137240","National Nature Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872087,51875457); National Cryptography Development Fund(grant numbers:MMJJ20180209); Key Foundation of National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U19B2021); Xi’an Science and Technology Plan(grant numbers:2020KJRC0109); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9657067","Attribute-based encryption (ABE);blockchain;personal health records (PHRs);search;smart contract;trace","Blockchains;Encryption;Cryptography;Smart contracts;Servers;Internet of Things;Cloud computing","authorisation;blockchains;computer crime;contracts;cryptography;electronic health records;information retrieval;storage management","secure decentralized attribute-based sharing;personal health records;PHR;patient-centered electronic health system;medical information storage;access control policy;attribute-based encryption;node cheating attacks;distributed PHR-sharing scheme;ciphertext policy ABE;encryption;decryption;CP-ABE cryptosystem;blockchain;security analysis;single points of failure;fair keyword search;medical information sharing;indistinguishable chosen plaintext attack;IND-CPA;indistinguishable chosen keywords attack;IND-CKA;smart contracts","","7","","49","IEEE","21 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, in this research, we proposed a blockchain-based dynamic document ownership verification system that can effectively mitigate problems through - (1) unique mapping of the document with the actual owner via smart contract technology, (2) storing and retrieving the crucial documents in a decentralized manner utilizing the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), and (3) record keeping of the document changes and version history via blockchain ledger technology.

A key challenge of realising TES is to enable a decentralised structure. With the gaining popularity of Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) and especially Blockchain in the year 2017, this trend has also gained traction in the field of TES to build a decentralised system. However, even before the aforementioned DLT approaches from 2017 onwards, there have been functioning TES implementations that are not based on DLT. It is also important to note that with all the advantages that the use of DLT brings, there are also new challenges linked with. The objective of this paper is to analyse, whether the use of DLT for TES is scientifically plausible or can be identified as a temporal hype. At first, the foundations of TES as well as the basic principles of using DLT for TES are being presented.

This data needs to be collected, stored, and shared among different healthcare actors for various purposes, such as reporting, analysis, collaborative research, and personalized healthcare services. However, the existing data storage and exchange solutions in the healthcare domain exhibit several challenges related to, e.g., data security, patient privacy, and interoperability. Recently, the industry and research community turned its focus to the possible use of blockchain technology to solve some of these challenges in the healthcare domain. The blockchain technology along with the support from smart contracts is considered a salient facilitator for secure and efficient health data sharing. This is due to its unique features, such as decentralization, trustlessness, immutability, traceability, and transparency. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art efforts that envision the use of blockchain-based solutions in the healthcare domain. To this end, we introduce a systematic framework for classifying and analyzing such systems. The framework consists of classification in several dimensions: interactions between healthcare entities, functional components of healthcare storage systems, challenges in the healthcare domain that can be overcome by using the blockchain technology, and benefits for healthcare storage systems derived from the fundamental features of the technology. When analyzing over 40 systems and solutions proposed in the state-of-the-art, we perform their rigorous placement by identifying the exact scope of each solution and mapping it to the above taxonomies of interactions, functional components, challenges, and benefits. We additionally provide an extensive discussion of compliance with privacy-related regulations of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in EU, and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

As an important aspect of collaboration mechanism, conventional resource trading (RT) among MDs relies on an onsite interaction process, i.e., price negotiation between service providers and requesters, which, however, inevitably incurs excessive latency and degrades RT efficiency. To overcome this challenge, this article adopts the concept of futures contract (FC) used in financial market, and proposes a smart futures for low latency RT. This new technique enables MDs to form trading coalitions and negotiate multilateral forward contracts applied to a collaboration term in the future. To maximize the benefits of self-interested MDs, the negotiation process of FC is modelled as a coalition formation game comprised of three components executed in an iterative manner, i.e., futures resource allocation, revenue sharing and payment allocation, and distributed decision-making of individual MD. Additionally, a FC enforcement scheme is implemented to efficiently manage the onsite resource sharing via recording resource balances of different task-types and MDs.

Nowadays, there are various startups, technology innovators, and steps taken by the government that work to enhance total crop production. All those innovations taken for the farming framework are called smart Farming (SF). Smart Farming includes consolidating data and correspondence advances into apparatus, hardware, and sensors in the rural creation framework. The advancement of technologies must be reduced to convey meaningful information. The economy of nations like India is highly dependent on agricultural production. So disease detection in plants using an efficient algorithm is supposed to be a vital job in the farming field. This research paper is presented in three-fold:(1) Efficient way to detect disease and find cavity area; It presents Image Segmentation Algorithm (2) Using data analysis in different ways which will work for crops in a better way.

The majority of current systems that manage electronic devices throughout their supply chain stages are centralized and lack data transparency, immutability, and security. Specifically, such systems are incapable of handling problems like comprehensive coverage of the life cycle of e-products, access control for maintaining data security, reputation-aware selection of stakeholders, and large amounts of data generated during various stages of the supply chain processes. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based IoT-enabled system for monitoring all post-production business processes, activities, and operations performed on an electronic device. The system is supported by five smart contracts that record the actions of users on the immutable distributed ledger that aid in ensuring that the business processes carried out by the participants are transparent, traceable, and secure.

At the same time, in the context of new employment patterns, the existing institutional arrangements have increased the insurance burden of workers and the government, and also broken the balance of social responsibility. “De employer” has put forward new requirements for the smart system of social insurance agency. This paper analyzes the social insurance handling process under the new employment pattern, and divides the business handling into horizontal and vertical businesses, including information flow and capital flow horizontally, and includes three levels of front office, middle office and back office vertically.

Blockchain ensures the integrity of data logs via its immutable ledger and decentralized architecture. Moreover, the blockchain smart contract functionality, embedded with attack detection, identification, and reconfiguration conditions realizes FTC and undertakes the mitigation response in case of cyber-attacks. The process monitoring mechanism embodies the principal component analysis technique and observer models trained via neural networks to detect an attack and identify the compromised component. An industrial benchmark Tennessee Eastman (TE) process is considered a case study to investigate the performance of the proposed framework. Two kinds of integrity attacks are applied to the sensors of the TE process with simulation results demonstrating the effectiveness of the method in mitigating the adversarial effect of the applied attacks on the overall system performance.

A group of mobile users is recruited with their smart devices to accomplish various sensing tasks in specific areas. The mobility and intelligence of mobile users enable MCS to achieve a sufficient coverage ratio of sensing tasks or areas. Currently, MCS is generally proposed and implemented in a centralized way under a platform’s control. However, this centralized structure is vulnerable to a single point of failure. The platform’s failure leads to a shutdown of the entire system. In addition, there is a trust issue between the platform and mobile users because of computational transparency and financial security. It is possible that the platform manipulates the working process of MCS to obtain an improper gain. To overcome these problems, we propose a decentralized MCS framework, named ChainSensing, by leveraging blockchain. In ChainSensing, mobile users interact with blockchain via smart contracts to complete their operations, e.g., publishing sensing tasks and submitting collected data. Since there are computationally intensive problems in ChainSensing, e.g., path planning, path selection, and reward determination, it is significantly expensive to solve such problems in blockchain. Therefore, we propose to leverage smart devices and computing oracles to solve these problems. Specifically, we propose a heuristic algorithm to solve the path planning problem in smart devices of mobile users; we employ computing oracles to solve the path selection and reward determination problems. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations based on Ethereum to evaluate the performance of ChainSensing.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3094670","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Fonds de Recherche du Qubec—Nature et Technologies (FRQNT); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9474463","Blockchain;decentralized framework;mobile crowdsensing (MCS);smart contract","Task analysis;Sensors;Blockchain;Smart contracts;Internet of Things;Crowdsensing;Smart devices","blockchains;mobile computing;path planning;sensor fusion;telecommunication security","ChainSensing;novel mobile crowdsensing framework;blockchain;mobile users;smart devices;sensing tasks;mobility;decentralized MCS framework","","1","","37","IEEE","5 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Data deduplication can be adopted to improve communication efficiency and minimize storage space. However, in edge computing, data deduplication brings security and functionality requirements that are still unsatisfied. Most existing schemes are vulnerable to brute-force attacks and single-point attacks. Moreover, they impose a heavy burden on resource-constrained edge nodes and do not support cross-domain deduplication. Blockchain is a promising technology because the programmable smart contract can be utilized to perform cross-domain deduplication and guarantee the traceability of data. In this article, an efficient dynamic cross-domain deduplication scheme in blockchain-enabled edge computing is proposed to solve the above problems. Specifically, the smart contract is employed to assist cross-domain deduplication, which also can reduce the storage pressure of edge nodes. Meanwhile, a hash proof system-based oblivious pseudorandom function is created to reduce the time cost of key generation and achieve the security requirements of resistance to brute-force attacks and single-point attacks. The technology of accumulators is adopted to achieve Proofs of Ownership (PoO), which can prevent duplicate-faking attacks. The security analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme has a higher security level. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed scheme significantly reduces computation cost and communication overhead, compared with other existing schemes. The smart contract is implemented in the Ethereum test network (i.e., Rinkeby), which shows acceptable gas cost even the functions are called frequently.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3150042","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072054,62102297); Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2021GY-047); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, CHD(grant numbers:300102242201); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020A1515110496); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:XJS210105); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9708087","Blockchain;data deduplication;edge computing;security and privacy;smart contract","Security;Servers;Edge computing;Cloud computing;Blockchains;Smart contracts;Internet of Things","blockchains;cloud computing;Internet of Things;storage management","single-point attacks;computation cost;communication overhead;smart contract;blockchain-enabled efficient dynamic cross-domain deduplication;online storage system;data deduplication;security analysis;functionality requirements;brute-force attacks;resource-constrained edge nodes;blockchain-enabled edge computing;hash proof system-based oblivious pseudorandom function;Internet of Things;proofs of ownership;duplicate-faking attacks","","3","","59","IEEE","9 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The most fragile individuals in society, such as the poor and small retailers and restaurants, are consistently impacted by this. The food supply chain has become broader and more complicated due to the expansion of the industry throughout the world, which prevents the old transportation model from meeting customer expectation. Food distribution chains face a number of difficulties, including poor traceability and connectivity, the availability of phoney food goods, and ineffective facility inspection.

In the past, a wide variety of studies have examined the oracles from various perspectives such as their implementation characteristics and their reliability. Unlike some other studies, this paper analyzes the use of Oracles through a static analysis of smart contracts. First, we analyze the source code of a corpus of over 40K smart contracts to find the most blockchain Oracles used by the Ethereum blockchain. On the basis of previous works, we examine the features of the most used blockchain Oracles in Ethereum.

However, limitations regarding hardware and edge computing resources can challenge the suitable implementation of these systems. Furthermore, cybersecurity has become a serious concern since one needs to ensure system availability and the integrity and authenticity of large data amounts. This paper proposes the thoughtful employment of cloud computing resources to address the abovementioned problems, applying microservices and cloud computing for validating blockchain security and monitoring the protection of physical environments. Our contributions focus on two main aspects: a microservices-based architecture to deal with data receiving, analysis, and storage while enhancing availability; and the integration of blockchains as a security mechanism to verify data integrity and authenticity using smart contracts. Moreover, our proposal also discusses the challenges involving blockchains in a Big Data scenario and appropriate mechanisms to deal with scalability and performance constraints. Finally, we present a complete implementation of our architecture using the AWS cloud environment and Hyperledger Fabric platform. Our tests demonstrate how microservices can help increase blockchain throughput.

In order to improve the user engagement and task completion quality of VCS, an appropriate incentive mechanism can promote enough users to participate in the sensing activities and further provide high-quality sensing data. However, due to the contradiction between personal interests and user data security protection, the development of the incentive mechanism is seriously affected. To deal with these challenges, this paper aims to propose a security protection incentive mechanism with data quality assurance (SPIM-DQA) for the VCS system. First, we adopt the blockchain-enabled VCS framework, and propose a series of smart contracts to ensure the automatic execution of the incentive mechanism, which solves the user data security issues existing in the traditional incentive mechanism. Then, based on this framework and these smart contracts, a data quality-aware incentive mechanism is proposed from the perspective of data quality. After selecting low-cost and high-quality users to perform the crowdsensing task, user reputation is updated by evaluating the quality of the provided data. In particular, there is a correlation between user reputation and reward distribution, which incentivizes users to consistently provide high-quality data to increase their rewards. Finally, extensive simulation results show that SPIM-DQA can effectively improve data quality while meeting security requirements.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2023.3262800","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62231020,62101401); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:ZYTS23178); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10086662","Vehicular crowdsensing;incentive mechanism;blockchain;security;data quality","Sensors;Task analysis;Crowdsensing;Data integrity;Blockchains;Smart contracts;Particle measurements","","","","","","","IEEE","29 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

These ride-hailing services (RHS) bring convenience to our life; however, at the same time they, also raise security concerns for users. For example, several recent news items show that a considerable number of registered drivers whose licenses have been revoked are still taking RHS orders on the respective platforms; this phenomenon directly leads to insecurity on part of its users and the bad reputation of the ride-hailing service provider (SP). The traditional solution to solve this problem is to periodically check the validity of the drivers’ licenses; however, it is a considerably time-consuming and costly process since the SPs have to manually interact with the governing authorities. Therefore, in this paper, we have presented an auditable self-sovereign identity system (named AudiSSI), which provides an efficient approach for the SPs to manage their registered drivers’ qualifications in a decentralized and automatic manner. Further, using smart contract technology, we propose a safety guarantee insurance in the form of an auditing contract to enable the RHS rider to check their driver's qualifications before the trip starts and get incentives once they detect a disqualified driver. We designed an incentive mechanism and have provided a game theoretical analysis. Finally, we implemented a prototype of AudiSSI and deployed it on Hyperledger Indy and Fabric to show that self-sovereign identity system for RHS driver with qualification auditing is efficient and technically feasible.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2021.3108012","Blockchain Core Technology Strategic Research Program of Ministry of Education(grant numbers:2020KJ010801); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9524519","Auditing;blockchain;smart contract;ride-hailing;game theory;insurance scheme;decentralized system","Vehicles;Distributed ledger;Licenses;Security;Insurance;Safety;Mobile computing","blockchains;contracts;data analysis;financial data processing;game theory;incentive schemes;insurance;security of data;transportation","AudiSSI;auditing contract;automated incentives;disqualified driver;disqualified drivers auditing;drivers qualifications;Hyperledger Indy;private ride-hailing companies;qualification auditing;registered drivers;RHS driver;RHS orders;RHS rider;ride-hailing service provider;safety guarantee insurance;safety warning;self-sovereign identity system;smart contract technology;Uber","","3","","44","IEEE","27 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Conventional onsite spot trading could facilitate this paradigm with proper incentives, which, however, incurs excessive decision-making latency/energy consumption, and further leads to underutilization of dynamic resources. Motivated by this, a hybrid market unifying futures and spot is proposed to facilitate resource trading among an edge server (seller) and multiple smart devices (buyers) by encouraging some buyers to sign a forward contract with seller in advance, while leaving the remaining buyers to compete for available resources with spot trading. Specifically, overbooking is adopted to achieve substantial utilization and profit advantages owing to dynamic resource demands. By integrating overbooking into futures market, mutually beneficial and risk-tolerable forward contracts with appropriate overbooking rate can be achieved relying on analyzing historical statistics associated with future resource demand and communication quality, which are determined by an alternative optimization-based negotiation scheme. Besides, spot trading problem is studied via considering uniform/differential pricing rules, for which two bilateral negotiation schemes are proposed by addressing both non-convex optimization and knapsack problems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism achieves mutually beneficial player’s utilities, while outperforming baseline methods on critical indicators, e.g., decision-making latency, resource usage, etc.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2022.3141094","Discovery Program of Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(grant numbers:RGPIN2018-06254); Canada Research Chair Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9682584","Futures trading;spot trading;overbooking;forward contract;mobile edge networks","Decision making;Smart devices;Task analysis;Servers;Forward contracts;Dynamic scheduling;Mobile handsets","cloud computing;decision making;electronic commerce;knapsack problems;mobile computing;multi-agent systems;optimisation;power markets;pricing;resource allocation","spot market;overbooking-enabled resource trading;mobile edge networks;necessary resources;effective resource trading;critical technique;computation-intensive mobile applications;conventional onsite spot trading;proper incentives;dynamic resources;hybrid market unifying futures;edge server;multiple smart devices;forward contract;remaining buyers;substantial utilization;profit advantages;dynamic resource demands;futures market;risk-tolerable forward contracts;appropriate overbooking rate;future resource demand;communication quality;alternative optimization-based negotiation scheme;trading problem;mutually beneficial player;resource usage","","2","","51","IEEE","14 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In response to this situation, CP operators have taken private CPs into the shared charging system. Due to the lack of maintenance personnel for private CPs that join shared charging, users often face the problems of damaged CPs and poor service attitudes of CP owners. Reputation solutions based on third-party platforms face a problem of single-point failures and reputation solutions based on blockchain face problems of storage and query efficiency. To improve storage and query efficiency, this article proposes a multichain charging model that stores different types of information on different blockchains. However, it faces the problem of unreliable information called across chains, when calculating reputation across chains. Therefore, this article proposes a cross-chain trusted smart contract ( $C_{2}T$  smart contract) to ensure the authenticity, real-time, and interchain write mutual exclusion of cross-chain information, making reputation calculation in the multichain charging model more convenient and more accurate. Especially, we propose a data mutual trust mechanism based on Merkle proof to ensure the authenticity of cross-chain information and prevent forged information from participating in calculating reputation. Furthermore, we present a data structure composed of multiple counting Bloom filters (MCBFs) to verify the real time of information and filter out non-real-time information, thereby ensuring the real time of the calculated reputation. In addition, we put forward an algorithm to guarantee the interchain write mutual exclusion by hash mutexes, making the reputation calculation process more accurate and complete. The security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that  $C_{2}T$  smart contract is feasible in practice.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3099898","Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:M21029); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1800302); Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61802005); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9495937","Charging model;cross-chain;multichain;reputation;smart contract","Blockchains;Smart contracts;Real-time systems;Internet of Things;Faces;Data models;Special issues and sections","blockchains;data structures;message authentication;query processing;trusted computing","mutual exclusion;cross-chain information;multichain charging model;data mutual trust mechanism;forged information;nonreal-time information;calculated reputation;reputation calculation process;smart contract;cross-chain trusted reputation scheme;shared charging platform;electric vehicles;CP operators;shared charging system;maintenance personnel;poor service attitudes;CP owners;reputation solutions;third-party platforms;single-point failures;query efficiency;unreliable information;blockchain f;damaged CP;private CP","","4","","42","IEEE","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Also, there is a lack of linkage in the prescription data between the medical care provider and the pharmacy, which also leads to miscommunication and the use of false prescriptions.

Moreover, with the rapid increase of IIoT devices, a large amount of data is swapped between heterogeneous sensors and devices every moment. This trend increases the risk of eavesdropping and hijacking attacks in communication channels, so maintaining data privacy and security becomes two notable concerns at present. Recently, based on the mechanism of the Schnorr signature, a more secure and lightweight certificateless signature (CLS) protocol is popular for the resource-constrained IIoT protocol design. Nevertheless, we found most of the existing CLS schemes are susceptible to several common security weaknesses such as man-in-the-middle attacks, key generation center compromised attacks, and distributed denial of service attacks. To tackle the challenges mentioned previously, in this article, we propose a novel pairing-free certificateless scheme that utilizes the state-of-the-art blockchain technique and smart contract to construct a novel reliable and efficient CLS scheme. Then, we simulate the Type-I and Type-II adversaries to verify the trustworthiness of our scheme. Security analysis as well as performance evaluation outcomes prove that our design can hold more reliable security assurance with less computation cost (i.e., reduced by around 40.0% at most) and communication cost (i.e., reduced by around 94.7% at most) than other related schemes.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2021.3084753","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072485); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9444140","Blockchain;certificateless signature (CLS);Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT);Internet of Things (IoT);security and privacy","Industrial Internet of Things;Security;Smart contracts;Elliptic curves;5G mobile communication;Generators;Denial-of-service attack","computer network security;cryptographic protocols;cryptography;data privacy;digital signatures;public key cryptography;smart power grids;telecommunication security","key generation center compromised attacks;novel pairing-free certificateless scheme;state-of-the-art blockchain technique;smart contract;security analysis;reliable security assurance;related schemes;blockchain-based;IIoT devices;personal lifestyles;society operations;novel digital mode;tremendous associations;intelligent logistics;smart grid;smart city;heterogeneous sensors;devices every moment;eavesdropping hijacking attacks;communication channels;data privacy;notable concerns;Schnorr signature;resource-constrained IIoT protocol design;existing CLS schemes;common security weaknesses;man-in-the-middle attacks","","110","","23","IEEE","28 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This research aims to develop and validate an intelligent microgrid management system to secure the competitiveness of Singapore’s energy market, by leveraging the inherent synergy between two emerging technologies, i.e., blockchain for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) solar power trading and fog computing for grid infrastructure management. For this vision, we have developed FogChain, an integrative, cost-effective, and scalable microgrid operating system (MGOS), consisting of three technical service layers: 1) a novel microgrid information infrastructure based on the fog-computing paradigm (i.e., intelligence on edge); 2) a blockchain-based microgrid service layer, providing smart contract and decentralized control capabilities for grid application development; and 3) a microgrid application layer (i.e., P2P energy trading) over the blockchain-based grid service. This MGOS would fundamentally transform how solar power is traded among participating electricity prosumers, leading to potentially new operational and business models. We have implemented the FogChain system and conducted extensive experiments to verify its performance advantages. Our results demonstrate that FogChain can efficiently process energy auction among 1000 participants with 1.1 s delay on average, reduce transmission cost up to 20% under the loss-aware trading mechanism, and reduce the solar yield prediction error to 0.11. Our system prototype suggests that FogChain provides a promising solution for efficient decentralized energy trading and intelligent distributed control for microgrids.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3109057","National Research Foundation, Singapore; Energy Market Authority through Energy Programme under EP(grant numbers:NRF2017EWT-EP003-023); MOE through Tier-1 Grant Call(grant numbers:RG96/20); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9525444","Blockchain;distributed system;energy trading;fog computing;microgrid management;smart contract","Microgrids;Blockchains;System analysis and design;Hardware;Peer-to-peer computing;Smart contracts;Renewable energy sources","blockchains;carbon;cost reduction;distributed control;distributed power generation;grid computing;peer-to-peer computing;power engineering computing;power generation economics;power markets","fog AI;off-grid operations;central grid;intelligent microgrid management system;Singapore energy market;grid infrastructure management;scalable microgrid operating system;fog-computing paradigm;blockchain-based microgrid service layer;P2P energy trading;potentially new operational business models;FogChain system;system prototype;intelligent distributed control;blockchain-based Peer-to-Peer solar power trading system;microgrid information infrastructure;distributed generation;carbon reduction;cost-effective;MGOS;transmission cost reduction;smart contract;time 1.1 s;C","","4","","48","IEEE","31 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, a blockchain-based federated learning (BFL) with a reputation mechanism for high-quality model aggregation is proposed. Specifically, the blockchain transforms the federated learning into a decentralized and trustworthy manner. Over the blockchain, federated learning tasks, undertaken by smart contracts, can be conducted transparently and fairly. Besides, a reputation-constrained data contribution and reward allocation mechanism is designed to encourage data owners to participate in BFL and contribute high-quality data. The noncooperative game is adopted to analyze the behavior strategies of data owners. The existence of the unique equilibrium is proved and the equilibrium point indicates that the data owners can acquire highest reward with the contribution of the highest quality data. Thus, the model quality of BFL is guaranteed. Finally, simulations on the public data sets (MNIST and CIFAR10) demonstrate that BFL with a reputation mechanism can well promote the high-quality model aggregation of federated learning as well as can prevent malicious nodes from corrupting the training task.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3160425","NSF of China(grant numbers:61877055,61902358); NSF of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:LY22F030006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9737334","Blockchain;federated learning;high-quality model;reputation mechanism;smart contract","Collaborative work;Data models;Task analysis;Blockchains;Training;Computational modeling;Smart contracts","blockchains;contracts;game theory;learning (artificial intelligence);peer-to-peer computing","public data sets;BFL;reputation mechanism;high-quality model aggregation;blockchain-based federated learning;reputation-motivated task participation;machine learning collaboratively;data owners;high-quality data;federated learning tasks;reputation-constrained data contribution;highest quality data;model quality","","5","","41","IEEE","18 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, by adopting blockchain and smart contracts, we propose a secure and efficient access control scheme of user subscription data in roaming scenarios. We further design a flexible user authentication scheme, which utilizes derivable tokens based on the proposed access control scheme. By using blockchain to store and manage user subscription data, access control can be decentralized without any trusted third party. Besides, by implementing automatic verification of access privilege through smart contracts, the limitation of the home operators’ real-time participation is eliminated. In addition, to further improve security and reduce the on-chain storage overhead, we optimize the data encryption and storage scheme utilizing threshold secret sharing.

However, in practice, the different assets that make up ME-CPS are operated by independent entities with different objectives and perspectives in mind. A new methodology is introduced that puts the stakeholders at the center of the design process by assuming that the system will be correctly designed and operated if all stakeholders reach a common agreement using formal contracts, which can be simulated for verification and validation before signature. Models are used to structure the relationships between stakeholders at all stages of the systems lifecycle: formal contracts are derived from high-level goals and are verified using “digital twins” that include requirement models and behavioral models. This new method was applied within a research project at EDF Lab to coordinate stakeholders for the renovation of a district to make it greener and smarter. Two scenarios were simulated revealing disagreements between stakeholders, and that satisfying ambitious key performance indicators (KPIs) is not an easy task requiring careful cooperation between actors.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2021.3071231","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9420455","Codesign methodology;formal contracts;high-level goals;model-based;modeling;multienergy cyber-physical systems (ME-CPSs);simulation;stakeholders","Stakeholders;Contracts;Solid modeling;Task analysis;Requirements engineering;Computational modeling;Complex systems","contracts;cyber-physical systems;energy management systems;environmental management;formal verification;sustainable development","multienergy cyber-physical systems;societal awareness;carbon footprint;energy landscape;future energy systems;smart operation;ME-CPS;formal contracts;systems lifecycle;requirement models;behavioral models;model-based engineering methodology;stakeholders coordination;digital twins;EDF Lab;key performance indicators;KPI","","","","31","IEEE","3 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing research has shown that the centralized systems, as the mainstream mode, are under the great risks. Motivated by this, we propose a consortium blockchain-based PHR management and sharing scheme, which is both security aware and privacy preserving. We adopt the interplanetary file system (IPFS) to store the PHR ciphertext of IoMT. Then, zero-knowledge proof can provide evidence for verifying keyword index authentication on blockchain. Moreover, the scheme jointly leverages modified attribute-based cryptographic primitives and tailor-made smart contracts to achieve secure search, privacy preservation, and personalized access control in IoMT scenarios.

However, privacy and security problems remain largely unresolved in the safety area. Various rule-based methods have been considered to recognize aberrant behaviors in IoMT and have demonstrated high accuracy of misbehavior detection appropriate for lightweight IoT devices. However, most of these solutions have privacy concerns, especially when giving context during misbehavior analysis. Moreover, falsified or modified context generates a high percentage of false positives and sometimes causes a by-pass in misbehavior detection. Relying on the recent powerful consolidation of blockchain and federated learning (FL), we propose an efficient privacy-preserving framework for secure misbehavior detection in lightweight IoMT devices, particularly in the artificial pancreas system (APS). The proposed approach employs privacy-preserving bidirectional long-short term memory (BiLSTM) and augments the security through integrating blockchain technology based on Ethereum smart contract environment. The effectiveness of the proposed model is bench-marked empirically in terms of sustainable privacy preservation, commensurate incentive scheme with an untraceability feature, exhaustiveness, and the compact results of a variant neural network approach. As a result, the proposed model has a 99.93% recall rate, showing that it can detect virtually all possible malicious events in the targeted use case.

This paper is aimed at addressing such procurement-specific challenges. This study reflects the current status and the trends in public procurement, as well as the manner in which Blockchain and the Internet of Things (BIoT) may lead to a beneficial change in the field. In order to analyse the impact of BIoT, we are putting forward an assessment model comprising the definition and the description of six hypotheses. They are validated both by reference to the current knowledge status and via the analysis of the data collected in a survey which was conducted in Romania. It was aimed at collecting and analysing the data from the main stakeholders as well as at formulating recommendations/actions related to the modernisation of the current system. The study uses structural equation modelling (SEM) to validate the proposed model and to establish the relationships between the adoption of BIoT and smart, sustainable and transparent public procurement. At the same time, we analyse the links between the adoption of BIoT and aspects such as corruption and fraud, the challenges related to technological integration and the need to reengineer organisations, as well as national and international policies. Following our analyses, there emerged that BIoT adoption has a positive impact on the achievement of sustainable public procurement processes (the highest effect), on transparency and the trust in public procurement, on reducing corruption and fraud in public procurement and on the achievement of smart public procurement. The paper provides theoretical and practical contributions that should support solutions to the current major challenges and represent a vehicle for innovation and sustainable development alike.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3182656","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9795015","Blockchain technology;Internet of Things;green public procurement;public procurement 40;smart contracts;smart public procurement;structural equation modeling;sustainable public procurement","Procurement;Blockchains;Sustainable development;Market research;Internet of Things;Europe;Artificial intelligence","blockchains;globalisation;government data processing;Internet of Things;procurement;statistical analysis;sustainable development","procurement-specific challenges;BIoT;smart procurement;transparent public procurement;sustainable public procurement processes;smart public procurement;blockchain and the Internet of Things;structural equation modelling;SEM","","","","86","CCBY","13 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As such, we propose a federated learning (FL) based approach to promote privacy-preserving collaborative machine learning for applications in smart industries. In our system model, a model owner initiates an FL task involving a group of workers, i.e., data owners, to perform model training on their locally stored data before transmitting the model updates for aggregation. There exists a tradeoff between service latency, i.e., the time taken for the training request to be completed, and age of information (AoI), i.e., the time elapsed between data aggregation from the deployed industrial Internet of Things devices to completion of the FL-based training. On one hand, if the data are collected only upon the model owner's request, the AoI is low. On the other hand, the service latency incurred is more significant. Furthermore, given that different training tasks may have varying AoI requirements, we propose a contract-theoretic task-aware incentive scheme that can be calibrated based on the weighted preferences of the model owner toward AoI and service latency. The performance evaluation validates the incentive compatibility of our contract amid information asymmetry, and shows the flexibility of our proposed scheme toward satisfying varying preferences of AoI and service latency.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2020.3046028","Alibaba Group through Alibaba Innovative Research; Alibaba-NTU Singapore Joint Research Institute; National Research Foundation Singapore; AI Singapore Programme; AISG(grant numbers:AISG-GC-2019-003); Singapore Energy Market Authority(grant numbers:NRF2017EWT-EP003-041,NRF2015-NRF-ISF001-2277); WASP/NTU(grant numbers:M4082187 (4080)); Ministry of Education - Singapore(grant numbers:RG16/20); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9300190","Age of information (AoI);contract theory;federated learning (FL);incentive mechanism;service latency","Data models;Training;Task analysis;Contracts;Agriculture;Data collection;Computational modeling","data aggregation;data privacy;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);production engineering computing","information freshness;federated learning based approach;privacy-preserving collaborative machine learning;FL task;data owners;data aggregation;industrial Internet of Things;FL-based training;AoI requirements;contract-theoretic task-aware incentive scheme;incentive compatibility;information asymmetry;age of information;service latency;smart industries","","18","","30","IEEE","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, CT itself can publish end users’ digital assets to other entities as a service, making data security and privacy major obstacles in the realization of V2X applications. Motivated from the aforementioned discussion, this article presents BDTwin, a blockchain and deep-learning-based integrated framework to enhance security and privacy in CT-driven V2X applications. Specifically, a blockchain scheme is designed to ensure secure communication among vehicles, roadside units, CT-edge server, and cloud server using a smart contract-based enhance-Proof-of-Work (ePoW) and Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP)-based verification process. Smart contracts are used to enforce rules and regulations that govern the behavior of V2X entities in a nondeniable and automated manner. In a deep-learning scheme, an autoregressive-deep variational autoencoder model is combined with attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory (A-BLSTM) for automatic feature extraction and attack detection by analyzing CT-edge servers data in a V2X environment.

The repositioning of refurbished devices into the market, however, is accompanied by a number of challenges, including concerns about quality and safety, as well as the risk of fraudulent activities such as counterfeiting. To address these challenges, we propose an NFT-based solution for managing refurbished medical devices that creates a secure, transparent, and verifiable record of the refurbishment process to ensure the safety and quality of these devices. The proposed solution utilizes dynamic composable NFTs as digital representations of medical devices, with replacement parts and certificate documents embedded in a parent-child NFT hierarchy, and reprocessing steps captured and reflected through the evolution of the dynamic tokens. This serves to authenticate and track the movement of refurbished devices while also providing a trustworthy means of managing individual devices and their ownership. Furthermore, the integration of non-transferable NFTs as certificates of refurbishment acts as an effective mechanism for detecting suspect medical devices and instances of fraudulent labeling, thereby increasing buyer confidence and promoting user safety. We leverage the Interplanetary File System to store and keep track of the metadata of the tokenized components of the system. We present the system architecture and implementation details with tested algorithms. We develop a front-end decentralized application (DApp) to interact with the designed smart contracts and showcase their functionalities.

There exist two types of CSE participants: the requester, who posts a task including a set of requirements, and workers, including developers and testers, completing the task. Due to the centralized architecture, traditional CSE systems have raised the concern of untrustfulness since participants may collude with centralized platforms and behave maliciously to grab illegitimate interests. Some researches have utilized blockchain to solve the problem. Still, they either lack software traceability, which is significant for ensuring software quality, or cannot guar-antee users' transaction privacy owing to blockchain's openness. We propose STPChain, a CSE method for §_oftware Traceability and Privacy based on blockChain. To maintain software traceability, we articulate the process flow of CSE and implement it with smart contracts adapted to software development. The smart contracts ensure that every submission will automatically leave tamper-proof records. Credible software traceability links are realized through the records. To alleviate the transaction privacy leakage, we propose FGCA, a fine-grained CA (Certificate Authority) updating mechanism in consortium blockchain. Based on the finding that a traceability link belongs within a task, FGCA refines the digital certificates from user-level to task-level to conceal the connection between tasks and users. While guaranteeing transaction privacy, FGCA also keeps the traceability links by storing the relations between users' identifier and certificates. Security analysis demonstrates that STPChain can prevent malicious misbehaviors of participants in CSE. Case study illustrates that our method can be utilized to maintain traceability and save more than 70% of time when positioning relevant workers in CSE without transaction privacy leakage related to data openness. Performance experiments show the applicability of STPChain under CSE scenarios.","0730-3157","978-1-6654-8810-5","10.1109/COMPSAC54236.2022.00135","Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:XDA20080200); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFC3340204); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9842524","traceability;blockchain;crowdsourced software engineering;transaction privacy","Privacy;Data privacy;Conferences;Smart contracts;Software quality;Software;Blockchains","blockchains;contracts;crowdsourcing;data privacy;software maintenance;software quality","smart contracts;software development;credible software traceability links;transaction privacy leakage;consortium blockchain;STPChain;crowdsourced software engineering method;traditional CSE systems;software quality;fine-grained privacy;requester;workers;tamper-proof record;FGCA;fine-grained CA updating mechanism;certificate authority;digital certificate;security analysis","","","","27","IEEE","10 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a framework in which wholesale market bids are placed on forward energy markets by an aggregator of distributed residential batteries that are controlled in real time by a novel Home Energy Management System (HEMS) control algorithm to meet the market commitments, while maximising local self-consumption. The proposed framework consists of three stages. In the first stage, an optimal day-ahead or intra-day scheduling of the aggregated storage assets is computed centrally. For the second stage, a bidding strategy is developed for wholesale energy markets. Finally, in the third stage, a novel HEMS real-time control algorithm based on a smart contract allows coordination of residential batteries to meet the market commitments and maximise self-consumption of local production. Using a case study provided by a large U.K.-based energy demonstrator, we apply the framework to an aggregator with 70 residential batteries. Experimental analysis is done using real per minute data for demand and production. Results indicate that the proposed approach increases the aggregator's revenues by 35% compared to a case without residential flexibility, and increases the self-consumption rate of the households by a factor of two.

As a consequence of this combination, smart agriculture will be managed more autonomously and intelligently, resulting in greater efficiency and optimization of operations.","2333-942X","","10.1109/MSMC.2022.3197914","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9920965","","Smart agriculture;Systematics;Bibliographies;Supply chains;Smart contracts;Blockchains;Peer-to-peer computing","agriculture;data analysis;farming;Internet;Internet of Things;peer-to-peer computing;supply chain management","agricultural data;blockchain technology;blockchain-based Internet;indian farmers;IoT;merely smart farms;peer-to-peer systems;smart agriculture field;smart farming;systematic literature review;Things systems","","1","","12","IEEE","17 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

By contracting out the processing of data, this architecture makes it feasible to execute real-time Internet of Things applications with a bare minimum of lag time at a price that is affordable. During the process of formulating our plan, we made sure to take into account the significant problems that exist with the organizational effectiveness of the D2D-resource ECN. Furthermore, we took into consideration the following security issues that are caused when there is a lack of cooperation between task managers and asset suppliers. It is strongly advised to use an infrastructure that is based on blockchain technology in order to build smart contracts for commodities exchange and job allocation. IoT devices that are limited in their resource capacity are unable to employ the Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm that is currently in use since the mining process has a high computational dimensionality. As a result, we provide a proof-of-reputation (PoR) consensus technique, in which the piece of machinery that has the highest reputation score is tasked with the responsibility of monitoring the whole process. The blockchain records both the history of transactions and data relating to reputation. The popularity score for each device is calculated using a formula that takes into account both its current performance in calculations and its past reputation. As evidenced by our security analysis, feasibility research, and numerical results, the compute offloading approach that we have presented for usage in a decentralized D2D-ECN system is both secure and effective for deployment in that environment.","","979-8-3503-2230-9","10.1109/AISC56616.2023.10085540","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10085540","proof-of-reputation;device-to-device edge computing;the Proof-of-Work algorithm","Performance evaluation;Smart contracts;Computer architecture;Proof of Work;Real-time systems;Blockchains;Internet of Things","","","","","","12","IEEE","3 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

So we present a blockchain-based multi-layer data security sharing model (ML-DSM). The model not only combines blockchain and attribute-based access control technology, but also introduces malicious access behavior judgment and user rating mechanism. Judging malicious access behavior helps detect malicious users in time at the early stage of access control, and effectively prevents malicious attacks such as DoS. In the user rating mechanism, the smart contract evaluates the user's reputation level based on the user's current and historical reputation scores and judges whether the reputation level is higher than the level of the requested data. The rating mechanism not only dynamically adjusts the access rights of the requestor but also effectively reduces the average judgment time of access control. The final experimental analysis results show that the data sharing model in this paper can improve the execution efficiency of access control while ensuring the security of the shared data. Thus ML-DSM achieves more secure and efficient data sharing.","2833-8898","979-8-3503-3154-7","10.1109/CyberC55534.2022.00020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10090209","blockchain;smart contract;data sharing;attribute-based access control;reputation level","Access control;Data security;Computational modeling;Smart contracts;Permission;Knowledge discovery;Data models","authorisation;Big Data;blockchains;computer network security;contracts;data privacy;security of data","access control technology;big data;blockchain-based multilayer data security sharing model;malicious access behavior judgment;opaque data;requested data;secure data sharing;shared data;traditional data sharing model;user rating mechanism","","","","23","IEEE","5 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On the one hand, when consumers retrieve the encrypted data that are stored in cloud storage, cloud storage may tamper with the returned results. On the other hand, when there is no trusted third party, it is difficult to restrict malicious transactions and ensure the fairness of both parties to the transaction. In this article, we propose a searchable re-encryption scheme for data transactions to prevent cloud storage from returning incorrect results.

Blockchain paves the way to a decentralized system diverging from the current centralized system. One such captivating phenomenon in the Blockchain would be that of NFTs. NFTs are non-fungible tokens; they are a form of digital art and could be anything from pictures, music, videos, or games. NFTs could be considered the real-world equivalent of indispensable assets like gold, silver, stocks, or bonds. They are unique and have predominant characteristics that make them invaluable to their collectors, admirers or even creators allowing them to be a great source of investment and trading. This great potential in acquiring a large capital is what makes the establishment of a platform that could be used by both creators and consumers for doing dealings in NFTs exceedingly compelling. This paper puts forth a way to develop an NFT marketplace i.e., a decentralized application(dApps) for the trade of NFTs. For this cutting-edge application, some key and fundamental concepts such as smart contracts, wallets, token standards and a lot more are explored. A system design has been proposed that highlights all the essential features like minting, listing, buying, and selling of NFTs. A precise analysis of the benefits and limitations associated with NFTs, and their marketplaces is done. Benefits being immutability, security and tokenization and the limitations being gas fees, legal issues, and environmental concerns, to properly determine the feasibility and value of developing such an application.","","979-8-3503-9720-8","10.1109/ICIDCA56705.2023.10100326","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10100326","Blockchain;Decentralized Applications (dApps);Smart Contracts;Wallets;Non-Fungible Token (NFT)","Silver;Law;Web 2.0;Smart contracts;Tokenization;Nonfungible tokens;Security","blockchains;contracts;cryptocurrencies;Internet;investment","Blockchain;creators;current centralized system;decentralized system diverging;existing Web 2;innovative Web 3;NFT marketplace;NFTs exceedingly compelling;nonfungible tokens;system design","","","","35","IEEE","20 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Looking at the current trend, we expect a massive proliferation of such IoT devices all around us. However, one of the issues with the widespread use of IoT is the increasing complexity of the underlying architecture, which leads to difficulty in ensuring security compliance. Key refreshment, one of the critical aspects of key management, requires a regular update of the key used to provide strong security. However, in most cases, keys are not updated. If they are updated, the update logs (e.g., time of last key update) are not available for all entities to verify and establish trust in the system. Moreover, the rules for key refreshment are also not defined transparently. In this direction, the present work proposes a blockchain-regulated, secure, verifiable, and automatic key refreshment mechanism for IoT systems. The proposed mechanism enables users to verify the freshness of the security keys (being used), thereby relying on the data from IoT devices and establishing trust in an IoT system. The proposed mechanism is driven by blockchain technology and smart contract. As proof of concept, we have implemented the proposed solution using Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric blockchains. Cost, scalability, and security (formal and informal) analyses have been carried out for performance analysis.

Prior works focused on specific factor explanations for a GNN model. In this work, we have designed and implemented Illuminati, a comprehensive and accurate explanation framework for cybersecurity applications using GNN models. Given a graph and a pre-trained GNN model, Illuminati is able to identify the important nodes, edges, and attributes that are contributing to the prediction while requiring no prior knowledge of GNN models. We evaluate Illuminati in two cybersecurity applications, i.e., code vulnerability detection and smart contract vulnerability detection. The experiments show that Illuminati achieves more accurate explanation results than state-of-the-art methods, specifically, 87.6% of subgraphs identified by Illuminati are able to retain their original prediction, an improvement of 10.3% over others at 77.3%. Furthermore, the explanation of Illuminati can be easily understood by the domain experts, suggesting the significant usefulness for the development of cybersecurity applications.","","978-1-6654-1614-6","10.1109/EuroSP53844.2022.00013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9797387","","Analytical models;Codes;Image edge detection;Smart contracts;Predictive models;Graph neural networks;Software","computer network security;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","Illuminati;cybersecurity applications;towards explaining graph neural networks;cybersecurity analysis;GNN;multilayer graph models;fraud detection;software vulnerability analysis;traditional neural networks;model predictions;specific factor explanations;comprehensive explanation framework;accurate explanation framework;pre-trained GNN model;code vulnerability detection;smart contract vulnerability detection;accurate explanation results","","","","63","IEEE","23 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The massive deployment of IoT devices, including sensors and actuators, is ushering in smart and connected communities of the future. The availability of real-time and high-quality sensor data is crucial for various IoT applications, particularly in healthcare, energy, transportation, etc. However, data collection may have to be outsourced to external service providers (SPs) due to cost considerations or lack of specialized equipment. Hence, the data market plays a critical role in such scenarios where SPs have different quality levels of available data, and IoT users have different application-specific data needs. The pairing between data available to the SP and users in the data market requires an effective mechanism design that considers the SPs’ profitability and the Quality-of-Service (QoS) needs of the users. We develop a generic framework to analyze and enable such interactions efficiently, leveraging tools from contract theory and mechanism design theory. It can enable and empower emerging data-sharing paradigms, such as Sensing-as-a-Service (SaaS). The contract design creates a pricing structure for on-demand sensing data for IoT users. By considering a continuum of user types, we capture a diverse range of application requirements and propose optimal pricing and allocation rules that ensure QoS provisioning and maximum profitability for the SP. Furthermore, we provide analytical solutions for fixed distributions of user types to analyze the developed approach. For comparison, we consider the benchmark case assuming complete information of the user types and obtain optimal contract solutions. Finally, a case study based on the example of a virtual reality application delivered using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed contract design framework.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2023.3236795","National Science Foundation (NSF)(grant numbers:ECCS-1847056,CNS-2027884,BCS-2122060); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10016667","Contract design;data pricing;Internet of Things (IoT);maximum principle;Quality-of-Service (QoS);Sensing-as-a-Service (SaaS)","Contracts;Sensors;Internet of Things;Quality of service;Pricing;Task analysis;Intelligent sensors","","","","","","47","IEEE","13 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, a sealed-bid auction that hides bidding prices is desirable. However, in previous sealed-bid auction protocols, it has been difficult to provide a “fund binding” property, which would guarantee that a bidder has funds more than or equal to the bidding price and that the funds are forcibly withdrawn when the bidder wins. Thus, such protocols are vulnerable to false bidding. As a solution, many protocols employ a simple deposit method in which each bidder sends a deposit to a smart contract, which is greater than or equal to the bidding price, before the bidding phase. However, this deposit reveals the maximum bidding price, and it is preferable to hide this information. In this paper, we propose a sealed-bid auction protocol that provides a fund binding property. Our protocol not only hides the bidding price and a maximum bidding price, but also provides fund binding, simultaneously. For hiding the maximum bidding price, we pay attention to the fact that usual Ethereum transactions and transactions for sending funds to a one-time address have the same transaction structure, and it seems that they are indistinguishable. We discuss how much bidding transactions are hidden. We also employ DECO (Zhang et al,. CCS 2020) that proves the validity of the data to a verifier in which the data are taken from a source without showing the data itself. Finally, we give our implementation which shows transaction fees required and compare it to a sealed-bid auction protocol employing the simple deposit method.","","978-1-6654-6104-7","10.1109/Blockchain55522.2022.00062","JSPS(grant numbers:JP21K11897,JP22H03588); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9881801","Blockchain;Sealed-bid Auction;Price Hiding;Fund Binding","Protocols;Statistical analysis;Smart contracts;Blockchains;IEEE transactions","blockchains;commerce;contracts;electronic commerce;pricing;protocols","sealed-bid auction protocol;fund binding property;bidding transactions;open-bid auction;false bidding;maximum bidding price;bidding phase;maximum bidding price leakage prevention;simple deposit method;smart contract;Ethereum transactions;one-time address;transaction structure;DECO","","","","33","IEEE","19 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Intuitively, we allow callbacks to introduce behaviors that cannot be produced by callback free executions, as long as they do not affect correctness. A chief insight is that the user is aware of the potential effect of the callbacks on the program state. To this end, we present a parametric verification technique which accepts this insight as a relation between callback and callback free executions.

In the scheme, a smart-contract-based secure edge computing architecture is designed by jointly considering the attack models and the characteristics of the 6G network infrastructures (e.g., satellites, drones, base stations, and roadside units), where each network infrastructure manages a number of parking vehicles to complete computing services collaboratively. With this architecture, based on the available computing resources owned by different network infrastructures, the collaborative computing resource allocation algorithm is designed to help each network infrastructure decide a customized service strategy (CSS) to satisfy the QoE of MVs. After deciding the CSSs, a model based on the second price-sealed auction is formulated to describe the competition among the network infrastructures, where the Nash equilibrium of the game is obtained to guide their optimal bidding strategies to obtain the chance for completing the services. The security analysis and the simulation results show that the proposed scheme can defend against the attacks and lead to a lower cost for completing the services than the conventional schemes.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3065970","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1807700); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071356,61901341,U1808207,91746114); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Ministry of Education of China(grant numbers:XJS200109,JB210113); Xi'an Science and Technology Association(grant numbers:095920201322); National Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2020JQ-301); Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project(grant numbers:D18003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9378794","Game theory;personalized edge computing;sixth-generation (6G) heterogeneous vehicular networks (HetVNETs);smart contract;space–air–ground-integrated networks (SAGINs)","6G mobile communication;Edge computing;Computational modeling;Task analysis;Quality of experience;Satellites;Drones","contracts;customer services;electronic commerce;game theory;Internet;power markets;pricing;quality of service;resource allocation","personalized edge computing services;6G heterogeneous vehicular networks;sixth-generation heterogeneous vehicular networks;HetVNETs;personalized requirements;computation-intensive applications;heterogeneous computing resources;novel secure scheme;smart-contract-based secure edge computing architecture;network infrastructure;parking vehicles;complete computing services;available computing resources;different network infrastructures;collaborative computing resource allocation algorithm;customized service strategy","","17","","39","IEEE","15 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This gives rise to numerous challenges related to information and data pertaining to medical devices used within healthcare supply chain, including data integrity, provenance, traceability, and transparency. Counterfeit medical devices are a major obstacle that the healthcare industry is trying to resolve as it poses a huge risk to the safety of its users. Therefore, it is paramount to have an end-to-end system in place that tracks medical devices not only as they move across the supply chain but also as they are purchased and sold online in digital marketplaces. Unfortunately, existing systems follow a centralized architecture, which leads to being a single point of failure and eradicating transparency and authentication. In this paper, we propose a non-fungible token (NFT) based solution that exploits blockchain smart contracts, integrates tokenization protocols, and utilizes a decentralized storage system for a reliable and efficient medical devices traceability system and ownership management solution. In our proposed system, NFTs are used to represent the digital twin of the medical device. This digital twin captures the medical device attributes and its relevant metadata during its life cycle from production, manufacturing, distribution and movement, to current use and ownership.

Han",NA; NA; NA; NA; NA; NA,"IEEE Network","","2022","PP","99","1","8","Smart contract over the blockchain accelerates the deployment of decentralized Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications. However, the usability of smart contracts is constrained to the data on the blockchain, and has no direct access to the off-chain environment. Consequently, smart contract cannot directly serve as a carrier for the IIoT applications that rely on intensive data exchange and task computation. To cope with this issue, we first propose an oracle-aided IIoT blockchain (OIB) system to facilitate the deployment of smart contract based IIoT applications. Specifically, a distributed oracle network is employed to not only bridge the off-chain environment and smart contracts, but also extend the computing capability of smart contracts. Then, we study important properties of the OIB system, i.e., liveness, safety, and fairness. In particular, we propose a new challenge of fairness to guarantee that each oracle can reap positive utility (i.e., individual rationality), and a new challenge of liveness to meet delay constraints of oracle services (i.e., delay-sensitivity). To address these two challenges, we develop an auction based incentive mechanism for the data-feeding oracles to achieve individual rationality as well as incentive compatibility, and a delay-sensitive matching based incentive mechanism for the computing oracles under specific delay constraints. Simulation results corroborate that the proposed auction based incentive mechanism guarantees not only truthfulness but also individual rationality, and show that the matching based incentive mechanism achieves smaller delay than the random selection scheme used in the Decentralized Oracle Service (DOS) network.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.103.2100395","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9852384","","Industrial Internet of Things;Blockchains;Smart contracts;Task analysis;Delays;Smart devices;Data centers","","","","","","","IEEE","8 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In this work, the frequency oscillations during peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading are regulated through the appropriate design of an adaptive controller and the implementation of a smart contract participation matrix (SCPM) for balancing the generation and consumer demand. A Proof-of-Authority (PoA) private blockchain-based SCPM has been developed to secure the contract among peers. The SCPM provides the power demand information from a consumer to a prosumer who participates in the P2P energy market. It also provides power reference to the prosumer distributed generation as a supplementary control, in addition to the secondary frequency control of the system. To study this, an islanded MG comprising four source nodes (prosumers) and three demand nodes (consumers) are tested with the implementation of the PoA-based blockchain framework. With its SCPM calculation running in the blockchain framework, the decentralized control of prosumers is implemented by interfacing the OPAL-RT with Raspberry Pi devices.

There are multiple types of blockchain and different consensus models. However, it is often a significant undertaking to determine if an application requires a blockchain. What kind of blockchain and consensus model is best suited for a given scenario? This paper addresses this challenge by evaluating different blockchain solutions along with the consensus models to determine the applicability for different use cases. We propose a guideline and applicability analysis framework (AAF) to determine whether an application needs a blockchain solution or not.

To eliminate the dependency on such a centralized storage architecture, several Decentralized Storage Network (DSN) schemes such as Filecoin, Sia, and Storj have been introduced. DSNs leverage blockchain technology to create a storage platform such that the micro storage providers can also participate in the storage market. To verify the accurate data storage by the storage providers during a storage contract, DSNs apply a Proof of Storage (PoS) scheme to continuously inspect the storage service. However, continuous verification of the storage provider imposes an extra cost to the network and therefore end-users. Moreover, DSN's PoS verification is vulnerable to a service denying attack in which the storage provider submits valid PoS to the network while denying the service to the client. Considering the benefits and existing challenges of DSNs, this paper introduces a novel incentive-compatible DSN scheme. In this scheme, the PoS is conducted only if the client submits a challenge request. We model the storage service as a non-cooperative repeated dynamic game and set the players' payoffs such that the storage provider's dominant strategy is to honestly follow the storage contract. Our proposed mechanism leverages the smart-contract and oracle network to govern the storage agreement between the client and storage provider efficiently. Furthermore, our scheme is independent of a specific blockchain platform but can be plugged into any blockchain platform with smart-contract execution capability. As a proof of concept, we have implemented our scheme using solidity language and chainlink oracle network. The performance analysis demonstrates the applicability of our scheme. The outcome of this paper is a new incentive-compatible mechanism designed carefully for the blockchain-based DSN. The proposed mechanism utilizes different tools including game-theory, smart-contract, oracle network, and Merkle tree to improve the security and performance of storage verification in DSN.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2023.3245326","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10045808","Decentralized Storage Network;Blockchain;Smart Contract;Mechanism Design","Blockchains;InterPlanetary File System;Games;Smart contracts;Satellites;Companies;Servers","","","","","","","IEEE","16 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Nevertheless, the existing centralized VCS framework mainly faces the system reliability problem while the decentralized one cannot satisfy the management flexibility. In addition, when the privacy preservation scheme that prevents information leakage encounters the user selection scheme that desires detailed information of participants, how to balance this seemingly irreconcilable contradiction is inevitable for VCS. To remedy that, we take the first research attempt and explore the balance point between the system management, privacy preservation, and quality of experience (QoE) of participants. By fully exploiting the characters of participating entities, a blockchain-enabled conditional decentralized VCS is proposed in this paper. Firstly, we propose a privacy-preserving scheme where the zk-SNARK proof combines with the mixed-task smart contract to guarantee the interaction process will not reveal any private information of participants.

In the framework, ASPs can flexibly delegate their authentication capabilities to the blockchain, and users authorized by different ASPs can be authenticated by the blockchain where the authentication events are publicly audited and traced. Since the blockchain is publicly accessible, users’ sensitive identity attributes may be exposed during the authentication process. To address privacy leakage caused by the authentication events, several privacy-preserving techniques, including threshold-based homomorphic encryption, zero-knowledge proof, and random permutation, are exploited to hide users’ sensitive information on the blockchain. Moreover, to improve user revocation efficiency, we integrate a cryptographic accumulator and secure hash functions into the framework where ASPs are allowed to revoke their users through a global revocation contract.

Utilizing the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and smart contracts, BlockRoam can significantly shorten the information exchanging delay, thereby addressing the roaming fraud problems. Through intensive analysis, we show that the security and performance of such PoS-based blockchain network can be further enhanced by incentivizing more users (e.g., subscribers) to participate in the network. Moreover, users in such networks often join stake pools (e.g., formed by MSPs) to increase their profits. Therefore, we develop an economic model based on Stackelberg game to jointly maximize the profits of the network users and the stake pool, thereby encouraging user participation. We also propose an effective method to guarantee the uniqueness of this game’s equilibrium.

Conventional coarse-grained data deduplication schemes (block or file level) are proved to be ineffective on this problem. Based on comprehensive analysis on typical blockchain workloads, we are the first to propose two new locality concepts: economic and argument locality. To further explore these new localities, we propose a novel fine-grained data deduplication scheme (transaction level) named Alias-Chain to improve the scalability of blockchains. Specifically, Alias-Chain replaces frequently used data, e.g., smart contract arguments, with much shorter aliases to reduce the block size. During prop-agation and preservation of blocks, smaller blocks result in both shorter synchronization time and lower storage cost. Simulation results show the average transfer and SC-call transaction sizes can be reduced by up to 11.23% and 43.23% in native Ethereum, and up to 61.95 % and 77.54 % in Ethereum optimized by state-of-the-art techniques, respectively. Prototyping-based experiments are further conducted on a testbed consisting of up to 3200 miners. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Alias-Chain on reducing block synchronization time and storage cost under typical real-world workloads.","1530-2075","978-1-6654-8106-9","10.1109/IPDPS53621.2022.00122","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972445); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9820700","Blockchain;Scalability;Locality;Deduplication","Distributed processing;Costs;Scalability;Simulation;Smart contracts;Blockchains;Synchronization","blockchains;contracts;storage management;synchronisation","content locality;block synchronization time;economic argument locality;transaction level;smart contract arguments;block size;storage cost;SC-call transaction sizes;blockchain scalability;alias-chain;fine-grained data deduplication;coarse-grained data deduplication;blockchain workloads;economic locality;argument locality;Ethereum","","","","35","IEEE","15 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, secure and atomic software delivery and payments between IoT devices and the manufacturer are assured through smart contracts. The authenticity of the delivered software is guaranteed by offloading the computation-based signature validation to smart contracts. Compliance audits are satisfied through immutable records on the blockchain’s public ledger, and the smart contracts efficiently guarantee the delivery of software updates in exchange for payment.

While conventional onsite spot trading may facilitate this paradigm, the inherent extra latency of onsite decision making and unreliable network significantly limit resource trading efficiency and the eventual resource utilization rate. More importantly, the “no show” of confirmed resource buyers incurred by unreliable network conditions, can result in negative impacts on trading performance and resource usage. To this end, resource overbooking is adopted that provides an effective solution in handling “no shows” while substantially improving resource utilization rate. In this article, an interesting overbooking-enabled resource trading paradigm in mobile edge networks is proposed, allowing pre-negotiated forward contracts between the edge server (seller) and a number of overbooked smart devices (buyers), which will be fulfilled during future trading. Specifically, a framework associated with the proposed trading paradigm is introduced first to provide a comprehensive view of the relevant key issues. Then a case study is presented that elaborates how the proposed trading can be implemented in practice.

The medical symptoms of ET and PST are equivalent, including gait, anxiety, and muscular stiffness. In both disorders, doctors diagnose patients related to clinical evaluations during such hospital visits, leading to misdiagnosis. Machine Learning (ML) is being used to classify the ET and PST using human-based feature extraction to address this issue. Motivated by this, we applied Deep Learning (DL) to overcome the ML issue via automating feature extraction through the model itself. In this paper, we have used the integration of Gated recurrent unit (GRU) and Long short term memory (LSTM) algorithms to predict tremor severity. Initially, accelerometer sensors are used to record tremors in all three axial dimensions for each subject. Further, this data is pre-processed using the standard scalar function and scaled in-unit variance. Furthermore, this data first passed through the GRU model, and later it fed into the LSTM model to improve the model’s performance. Moreover, we employed the blockchain (BC) network to validate the performance of the trained model. we have used a smart contract to validate the identity of the researcher. The proposed model outperforms with 80.4% training accuracy and 74.1% testing accuracy. The total communication and computation cost of the proposed scheme is 448 bits and 0.056 ms. The integration of BC and DL makes a system more reliable, transparent, and accurate.","","978-1-6654-0926-1","10.1109/INFOCOMWKSHPS54753.2022.9798053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9798053","Parkinson’s disease;Essential Tremor;Parkinson’s Tremor;Tremor severity;GRU;LSTM;Blockchain;Smart contract","Training;Deep learning;Computational modeling;Smart contracts;Feature extraction;Data models;Sensors","accelerometers;blockchains;brain;deep learning (artificial intelligence);diseases;feature extraction;gait analysis;medical disorders;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;recurrent neural nets;signal classification","deep learning;blockchain-based essential;Parkinson tremor classification scheme;neurological movement disorders;body part activation;medical symptoms;muscular stiffness;doctors diagnose patients;clinical evaluations;GRU model;LSTM model;blockchain network;human-based feature extraction;gated recurrent unit;long short term memory;accelerometer sensors;time 0.056 ms","","1","","16","IEEE","20 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

IoV also promises rich location-based services for vehicles, such as parking and toll highway. However, preserving privacy for location-based service payments emerges as a critical and challenging problem in IoV. Existing schemes rely on centralized banks for payment processing, resulting in location privacy leakage to centralized entities. In this paper, we propose a decentralized privacy-preserving payment scheme named Vehicloak for IoV based on the blockchain technology. The biggest challenge is to provide location privacy for vehicles while guaranteeing correct service payments using the transparent blockchain. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a new cryptographic technique called zk-GSigproof that integrates zero-knowledge proof with group signature. Vehicloak implements this technique in a smart contract to process payment, which verifies zero-knowledge proof and group signature without leaking location information. It is not limited to IoV and can be applied in many payment scenarios. To evaluate the performance of our scheme, we implement Vehicloak on a private blockchain of 100 nodes on Aliyun, and conduct a test with up to 4,000 transactions. The experimental results prove the feasibility of Vehicloak.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2022.3193165","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9837445","Blockchain;group signature;location privacy;smart contract;zk-SNARK","Privacy;Blockchains;Security;Task analysis;Smart contracts;Mobile computing;Dedicated short range communication","","","","3","","","IEEE","22 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, blockchain-based e-voting brings new problems in protecting voters’ privacy and ballots’ confidentiality, and causes a great performance degradation. In this paper, we propose AvecVoting, an anonymous and verifiable blockchain-based e-voting scheme, providing both strong security and high performance. Specifically, we utilize threshold encryption and one-time ring signature to protect voters’ privacy and ballots’ confidentiality. Furthermore, to improve the performance, we introduce the concept ""counter"" to count the ballots. Through the carefully designed RandomSortition and reputation-based PayOff algorithms based on smart contracts, AvecVoting can achieve correct counting even when some counters are untrustworthy. Our security and performance analyses show that AvecVoting provides strong security such as anonymity, non-repeatability, confidentiality, verifiability, etc., and meanwhile overcome the performance issues caused by blockchain and provides good efficiency in both voting and counting stages.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-8347-7","10.1109/ICC45855.2022.9838840","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Chinese Academy of Sciences; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9838840","E-voting;Blockchain;Smart Contract;One-time Ring Signature;Reputation","Degradation;Privacy;Smart contracts;Blockchains;Performance analysis;Encryption;Security","cryptography;data privacy;digital signatures;government data processing","AvecVoting;strong security;verifiability;counting stages;verifiable e-voting;untrustworthy counters;modern social life;traditional e-voting systems;trusted third party;voters;ballots;great performance degradation;anonymous blockchain-based e-voting scheme;verifiable blockchain-based e-voting scheme;concept counter","","1","","16","IEEE","11 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In BSCS, two types of blockchained smart contracts (SCs) are established with a bi-level interplay computing architecture. The lower-level contracts perform the predefined and learned patterns of task coordination for achieving resilience under internal disruptions. The upper-level contracts are incorporated with communication-efficient decentralized deep-learning algorithms for the learning, updating, transferring, and sharing of coordination patterns used in the autonomous decision in lower-level SCs, thereby achieving the continuous improvement of the system’s decentralized autonomous intelligence.

In medical sector, adoption of this technology is increasing at a slow pace and bringing significant transformation in ways of providing services to clients or end customers. Block-chain technology is known to have a positive influence on enhancing quality of healthcare services through integration of several advanced protocols and algorithms for effective detection of quality issues in medicine or device supply-chain. Besides that, patient data-protection has always been a challenge that this industry has suffered from and incorporation of block-chain-technologies can help this sector to cope with this problem by enhancing encryption of confidential information of patients. During transmission or storage of patient information, there could be reciprocations or changes in this information that are done for satisfaction of malevolent needs of people. This often causes organisations in this sector to face legal obligations resulting from poor and insecure management of operations. GPOs sometimes face significant challenges in determining if providers of medicines or devices are complying with quality standards as per contracts. However, Block-chain technology has aided in ensuring security and safety of medicines and other medical equipment by allowing tracing at different levels of supply chain. Present study is aimed at analysing impact of incorporating block-chain-technologies in operations-management of medical industry. Use of secondary data-collection and thematic analysis has helped in finding positive relationship between implementation of block-chain technology and improvement in operations management in this industry.

In order to help reduce the burden of government and thereby reduce spending, we intend to revolutionize the student loan program through blockchain and crowdsourcing. This work presents a blockchain-based crowdsourcing decentralized loan platform where investors will be brought on board to provide funds for students in higher education. The platform will allow students to apply for loans from investors through registered financial institutions. The students will pay back the loans with interest when they enter the workforce. The proposed platform will allow students to fund their education, investors will get interest on the money they invest, and governments can channel the money they put into student loan programs into other avenues. We perform a thorough security analysis and back the efficiency of our work with numerical results.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3252917","Key Laboratory of Intelligent Education Technology and Application of Zhejiang Province and Zhejiang Normal University Postdoctoral Fund(grant numbers:ZC304022961); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10058988","Blockchain;crowdsourcing;higher education;smart contracts;student loans","Crowdsourcing;Blockchains;Education;Task analysis;Smart contracts;Developing countries;Peer-to-peer computing;Finance","blockchains;crowdsourcing;epidemics;financial data processing;further education;investment","blockchain-based;brilliant but needy students;crowdsourcing;decentralized loan platform;developing countries;funding higher education;funds;global economic crisis;government;governments;student loan program;student loans","","","","25","CCBY","6 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most security mechanisms for traditional VANETs are centralized and have certain limitations in satisfying security requirements, such as anti-single-point failure, distributed security authentication of messages, and privacy preservation in VANETs. To address these issues, herein, we propose a dual blockchain-assisted conditional privacy-preserving authentication framework and protocol for VANETs. The identity authentication and privacy preservation of vehicles in VANETs can be realized without relying on a centralized trusted third party. The proposed scheme also allows for the conditional tracking of illegal vehicles. The decentralized dynamic revocation of illegal vehicles can be realized through smart contracts, rendering the scheme efficient and scalable. We implement this scheme in an Ethereum test network to demonstrate its feasibility and conduct an in-depth security analysis and comprehensive performance evaluation of the proposed scheme.

Meanwhile, our scheme is based on the audit method of the quad Merkle hash tree, using the root of the quad Merkle hash tree to verify the integrity of data, which significantly improves computing and storage efficiency.

Thousands of enterprise users and Internet of Things (IoT) devices have performed operations through services sold by computing resource providers. So far, the auction match is the main strategy for allocating resources, in which there exists a trusted third party playing a role as a broker to deal with resource allocation requests for both providers and consumers. The main concerns in resource allocation architecture are how and how long to solve the Winner Determination Problem (WDP), which is used to lay out the match outcome. It is not easy for a single broker with limited computing power to generate an optimal solution in a short period since its corresponding time complexity is regarded as the NP-hard problem. Meanwhile, it is hard for people to trust the third party thoroughly. That is, there are three potential issues, including centralization, data security, and untrustworthiness in traditional matching architecture. In particular, the real-time matching cannot be achieved to fulfill users who have urgent needs of computing resources. To solve above issues, we have designed a trustworthy and real-time decentralized computing resource allocation platform based on blockchain and smart contract. In order to optimize the allocation results, we improve the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) for miners to reach the consensus mechanism. Experimental results and comparison analysis have demonstrated that potential defects could be addressed in the new method, and the real-time resource allocation can be preserved firmly despite the balance vibration of market supply and demand.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2022.3215988","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9925641","Real-time;resource allocation;blockchain;smart contract;winner determination problem","Resource management;Real-time systems;Cloud computing;Smart contracts;Edge computing;Computer architecture;Supply and demand","blockchains;cloud computing;combinatorial mathematics;computational complexity;edge computing;genetic algorithms;resource allocation;trusted computing","auction match;blockchain;centralization;cloud computing;data security;decentralized computing resource allocation;edge computing;heterogeneous computing resource allocation;non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II;NP-hard problem;NSGA-II;resource allocation architecture;time complexity;trustworthy computing resource allocation;untrustworthiness;WDP;winner determination problem","","","","23","IEEE","20 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this issue effectively, we propose a scheme of patient-controlled medical data auditing in institutions by leveraging blockchain technology. We establish a permissioned blockchain network among medical departments and program smart contracts that allow patients to authorize changes to their data to build trust in the data while maintaining patient ownership. More specifically, we propose different evidence on-chain strategies that can be adapted to meet various data integrity and recoverability requirements for different data characteristics. Additionally, we present an adaptive hash method that ensures outstanding computational efficiency across a wide range of file sizes.

The problem becomes more analytical or disapproving when all vendors have their different root cause analysis metrics and SLAs. Most of the service providers have their own tools and terminology for dashboards and maintaining the Key performance indicators. Multi-cloud management process becomes more fragile during the different phases. This paper presents a blockchain-based multi-cloud infrastructure that provides end to end common platform to show real-time progress and a dashboard that provides a tracking management system to address the issues.","","978-1-6654-7416-0","10.1109/CISCT55310.2022.10046494","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10046494","Service level agreement;cloud service;blockchain;Ethereum;smart contract;multi-cloud","Industries;Cloud computing;Root cause analysis;Terminology;Key performance indicator;Real-time systems;Blockchains","blockchains;cloud computing","blockchain-based multicloud infrastructure;cloud computing technology;key performance indicator;multicloud management process;multicloud system;multiple service providers;multivendor environment;real-time progress;response times;root cause analysis metrics;SLA;time-critical applications;tracking management system","","","","12","IEEE","22 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed system runs a number of applications hosted by a local machine used to validate transactions. It then sends data to the rest of the network through InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Ethereum Swarm, forming a closed IoT ecosystem mastered by blockchain where a number of distributed IoT devices communicate and interact, thus forming a closed controlled environment.

Although a core requirement of such systems is user engagement, people may be reluctant to participate because sensitive information about them may be leaked or inferred from submitted data. The use of monetary rewards can help incentivize participation, thereby increasing not only the amount but also the quality of sensed data. Our framework allows users to submit data and obtain Bitcoin payments in a privacy-preserving manner, preventing curious providers from linking the data or the payments back to the user. At the same time, it prevents malicious user behavior such as double-redeeming attempts, where a user tries to obtain rewards for multiple submissions of the same data. More importantly, it ensures the fairness of the exchange in a completely trustless manner; by relying on the Blockchain, the trust placed on third parties in traditional fair exchange protocols is eliminated. Finally, our system is highly efficient as most of the protocol steps do not utilize the Blockchain network. When they do, only the simplest of Blockchain transactions are used as opposed to prior works that are based on the use of more complex smart contracts.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3227633","Kuwait University Research Grant(grant numbers:EO 01/20); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9976049","Crowd-sensing;participatory sensing;security and privacy;data reporting;incentives;rewarding mechanisms;zkSNARKs;bitcoin;blockchain","Blockchains;Sensors;Smart contracts;Data privacy;Task analysis;Bitcoin;Servers;Crowdsourcing","blockchains;cryptocurrencies;data privacy;mobile computing;protocols;sensor fusion","Bitcoin payments;Blockchain network;completely trustless manner;core requirement;crowd sensing applications;curious providers;double redeeming attempts;malicious user behavior;monetary rewards;multiple submissions;privacy-preserving manner;private Bitcoin rewards;rewarding framework;sensed data;sensitive information;smart contracts;submitted data;traditional fair exchange protocols;user engagement","","","","41","CCBY","8 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Payment channels have been extended to payment networks to utilize existing channels as intermediary links to route coins to others. However, payments through multiple channels bear nontrivial overheads, including time cost, charges at intermediate nodes, etc. In this paper, we propose channel hub, a novel off-chain system to shorten the routing path for the payment network. Channel hub allows transferring coins directly from one payment channel to another within the same hub, so that it can be viewed as a shortcut device for the underlying payment network. Compared with payment hub in literature, which connects participant nodes, our channel hub is more efficient and lightweight, because it connects channels already constructed by the payment network. Based on channel hub, we design a new protocol named Boros to perform secure off-chain cross-channel transfers. We present the security definition of Boros and formally prove its security using the UC-framework. To demonstrate the feasibility of Boros, we develop a proof-of-concept prototype running on Ethereum.

However, the traditional centralized data sharing/trading mechanism lacks trust guarantee and cannot satisfy the real-time requirement. Distributed systems, especially blockchain, provide us with promising solutions. In this paper, we propose a blockchain based non-repudiation scheme for IoT data trading to resolve the credibility and real-time limits. The proposed scheme has two parts, i.e., a trading scheme and an arbitration scheme. The trading scheme employs a divide-and-conquer method and two commitment methods to support efficient IoT data trading, which runs in a two-round manner. The arbitration scheme first leverages a smart contract to solve disputes on-chain in real time. In case of on-chain arbitration dissatisfaction, the arbitration scheme also employs an off-line arbitration to make a final resolution. Short-term and long-term analysis show that the proposed scheme enforces non-repudiation among the data trading parties and runs efficiently for rational data owners and buyers. We implemented the proposed scheme. Experimental results confirm that the proposed scheme has an orders-of-magnitude performance speedup than the state-of-the-art scheme.","2641-9874","978-1-6654-5822-1","10.1109/INFOCOM48880.2022.9796857","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9796857","IoT data trading;non-repudiation;blockchain;trust","Codes;Conferences;Smart contracts;Quality of service;Real-time systems;Blockchains;Smart devices","blockchains;divide and conquer methods;Internet of Things","divide-and-conquer method;on-chain arbitration dissatisfaction;off-line arbitration;rational data owners;machine-to-machine technology;IoT smart devices;real-time requirement;blockchain based nonrepudiable IoT data trading;next-generation wireless technology;distributed systems","","","","27","IEEE","20 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, blockchain technology is used to ensure the security of index, and intelligent contract is used to realize permission control, which ensures the privacy protection of users. Bloom filter is used to generate fixed-length index vectors corresponding to keyword sets, thus reducing the storage complexity of keyword indexes. The elements in the index vector are randomized by permutation, and this permutation is shared by attribute encryption technology. Only legitimate users can obtain this permutation and construct the trap of query keywords.

In this paper, we explore the potential of redactable blockchain and propose a privacy-preserving dynamic searchable encryption framework (DSE-RB), which is a general scheme that guarantees reliable queries and updates on encrypted data. In particular, we first use transaction-level editing technology to achieve a more flexible update operation of encrypted data without additional transactions while avoiding the waste of storage on the chain. To better support practical applications, we use an index partition method to divide the traditional binary tree index into a plurality of sub-indexes and introduce the concept of polynomials to simplify the whole access control mechanism. We define the security model and conduct repeated experiments on real data sets to test the efficiency. Experimental results and theoretical analysis show the practicability and security of our scheme.","2168-7161","","10.1109/TCC.2022.3228867","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9989344","Searchable Encryption;Redactable Blockchain;Ethereum;Smart contract;Access control","Blockchains;Indexes;Security;Servers;Encryption;Smart contracts;Cloud computing","","","","","","","IEEE","15 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Particularly, many outsourcing computation schemes have been proposed to dedicate the outsourcing polynomial computation due to its use in numerous fields, such as data analysis and machine learning. However, none of those schemes are practical enough, as they either require some time-consuming cryptographic operations to achieve fairness between the user and the worker, or cannot allow the user to outsource arbitrary polynomial to the worker, or need two non-collusive workers. To tackle these challenges, in this article, we propose a new outsourcing polynomial computation scheme by employing a variant of Horner’s method and the blockchain technology. Specifically, the former makes the computational cost on the worker side as low as possible, and the latter guarantees the fairness between the user and the worker if the result from the worker can be publicly verified. To achieve the public verifiability property, we apply the sampling technique, which is effective in our proposal according to a game-theoretic analysis. Furthermore, we also implement a prototype of our proposal and run it on an Ethereum test net.

However, adopting this technology will rely on management services that support safe operation. UAV traffic management systems (UTM) aim to facilitate safe, efficient, and fair access to the low-altitude airspace. However, these systems are centralized and lack protocols for secure interaction between the system agents such as authorities, service providers, and end-users. Another limitation of proposed UTM architectures is the absence of efficient mechanisms to enforce airspace rules and regulations. To address these issues, we present a decentralized UTM protocol that controls access to airspace and ensures the security objectives of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. For this purpose, we exploit features of the blockchain and smart-contract technologies. In addition, we employ a mobile crowdsensing technique to seamlessly enforce airspace rules and regulations that govern UAV operations. The solution is implemented on top of the Ethereum platform and evaluated using four different tools for smart-contract verification. We also provide security and performance analysis of the solution.

The system applied blockchain and smart contract to coordinate the certificate issuing process, and stored the issuing process logs and information used to verify certificates on the blockchain. It guaranteed the non-tamperability and non-repudiation of logs and information. Aiming at the disadvantage of easy leakage of private keys in centralized management mode, the system used the homomorphism of elliptic encryption algorithm, CPK and transformation matrix to generate and store user private keys safely and distributively.

In this research, we propose a new framework to detect malicious and suspicious Ethereum accounts using 3 different data sources (honeypot, Internet-wide scanner and blockchain explorer). The honeypot, named Etherpot, utilizes a proxy server placed between a real Ethereum client and the Internet. It modifies responses from the Ethereum client to attract attackers, identifies malicious accounts and analyzes their behaviors. With the Internet-wide scan results from Shodan, we also detect suspicious Ethereum accounts that are registered on multiple nodes. Finally, we utilize Etherscan, a well-known blockchain explorer for Ethereum, to track and analyze the activities related to the detected accounts. Through the observation of 6 weeks, we observed 538 hosts trying to call JSON- RPC of our honeypots with 41 different types of methods, including 2 types of unreported attacks in the wild. We detected 16 malicious accounts from the honeypots and 64 suspicious accounts from Shodan scan results, 5 out of which are overlapped.

For the blockchain-enabled IoT, this article proposes an efficient verification SE scheme with aggregation authorization and trusted revocation. With this scheme, DOs are willing to share their data to DUs for reward in a secure, efficient, and trusted way. For the DU, the DO can generate an aggregating key of a subset of encrypted documents, and then the DU has the privilege to search these documents and to verify the search results. By utilizing the trusted execution environment, the DO can revoke the search privilege of the DU.

Existing literature on energy trading focused on providing renewable energy to smart homes, smart buildings, and smart offices to fulfill their daily energy demands obtained from RESs. Besides, Electric Vehicles (EVs) use either power grid energy or a battery exchange mechanism to recharge their low EV batteries. The continuous use of power grids to recharge low EV batteries causes a significant load on power grids. Due to this, power grids are inadequate to fulfill the ever-increasing demands of EVs in the future. In this context, we propose a Blockchain Enabled Energy Trading (BEET) framework oriented EV charging. A system architecture of the BEET framework is presented to describe the functioning of each layer and its associated entities. We formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the revenue in the energy trading process using a knapsack optimization. Smart contracts are designed on the consortium blockchain network to sell and buy renewable energy to aggregators and from producers, respectively. Moreover, an EV charging mechanism is designed to intelligently allocate renewable energy to consumers at a low price. A comparative analysis is performed with state-of-the-art works in terms of charging price, revenue, throughput, and latency. The results indicate that the BEET framework outperforms compared to state-of-the-art works to address the renewable energy demand problem to realize E-mobility. It is clarified that the data considered in the experimental analysis were obtained from statistical simulations in realistic E-Mobility environment settings.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2023.3267565","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10103358","Blockchain;EVs;energy trading;optimization;RESs;smart contract","Renewable energy sources;Blockchains;Power grids;Electric vehicle charging;Charging stations;Batteries;Smart homes","","","","","","","IEEE","17 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

First, this paper defines VMEC-in-a-Box, a smart RSU combined with a MEC station, aimed at providing edge computing for vehicular applications by enabling job offloading from vehicles. VMEC-in-a-Box is equipped with a microeolic power generator to be autonomous and self-consistent even in presence of low levels of wind. The behavior of VMEC-in-a-Box is controlled by artificial intelligence to vary its computing capacity dynamically to pursue the best tradeoff between performance and power consumption, and to cooperate by offloading jobs to each other (horizontal offload) to improve performance and reliability of the system. Hence, the paper defines a Markov model to support decisions to optimize by means of Reinforcement Learning the system behavior according to two reward functions defined at the MEC and at the Vehicular Domains.

Supply chain systems may leverage blockchain technology (BT) to streamline supply chain operations in a trustworthy and secure way. The integration of the blockchain into supply chain systems looks promising but has a lot of challenges right now. The challenges are primarily because of the relatively new technology with lack of standards and guidelines, risk of adoption, and other risks like cost, time and information sharing.

For the past few years, entities being a part of the food processing system have usually taken food supply chain for granted, they forget that just one disturbance in the chain can lead to poisoning, scarcity, or increased prices. This continually affects the vulnerable among society, including impoverished individuals and small restaurants/grocers. The food supply chain has been expanded across the globe involving many more entities, making the supply chain longer and more problematic making the traditional logistics pattern unable to match the expectations of customers. Food supply chains involve many challenges like lack of traceability and communication, supply of fraudulent food products and failure in monitoring warehouses. Therefore there is a need for a system that ensures authentic information about the product, a reliable trading mechanism. In this paper, we have proposed a comprehensive solution to make the supply chain consumer centric by using Blockchain. Blockchain technology in the food industry applies in a mindful and holistic manner to verify and certify the quality of food products by presenting authentic information about the products from the initial stages.

The news collected from newspapers, social handles, and e-mails are web-scrapped, prepossessed, and sent to a proposed Q-global vector for word representations (Q-GloVe) model that captures the fine-grained linguistic semantics in the data. Based on the Q-GloVe output, the data are trained through a proposed bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) model, and the news is classified as real-or-fake news. This reduces the vanishing gradient problem, which optimizes the weights of the model and reduces bias. Once the news is classified, it is stored as a transaction, and the news stakeholders can execute smart contracts (SCs) and trace the news origin. However, only verified trusted news sources are added to the BC network, ensuring credibility in the system. For security evaluation, we propose the associated cost of the Bi-LSTM classifier and propose vulnerability analysis through the smart check tool for potential vulnerabilities. The scheme is compared against discourse-structure analysis, linguistic natural language framework, and entity-based recognition for different performance metrics. The scheme achieves an accuracy of 99.55% compared to 93.62% against discourse structure analysis. Also, it shows an average improvement of 18.76% against other approaches, which indicates its viability against fake-classifier-based models.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2021.3131945","FCT/MCTES through national funds and when applicable co-funded EU funds(grant numbers:UIDB/50008/2020); Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)(grant numbers:313036/2020-9); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9646438","Bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM);blockchain (BC);deep learning (DL);fake news identification","Fake news;Social networking (online);Data models;Distributed ledger;Stakeholders;Semantics;Security","blockchains;computational linguistics;deep learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;pattern classification;recurrent neural nets;trusted computing","bi-directional long short-term memory;Bi-LSTM classifier;blockchain-based deep learning-assisted classifier model;discourse-structure analysis;entity-based recognition;fake-classifier-based models;fine-grained linguistic semantics;linguistic natural language framework;Q-global vector;Q-GloVe model;SaTya scheme;smart check tool;smart community;trusted Bi-LSTM-Based fake news classification scheme;trusted chronology;verified trusted news sources;word representations model","","4","","32","IEEE","10 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to fill this gap, and considering that more than 80% of ICOs are launched based on Ethereum, this article conducts a systematic survey of the Ethereum ERC20 and ERC721 token ecosystem to characterize the creators and holders of the tokens and transfer activities. By downloading the entire blockchain, and analyzing transaction records and event logs, we constructed three complex network graphs, a token creator graph, a token holder graph, and a token transfer graph. By analyzing these graphs, we are able to obtain many observations including token activeness distribution, token holder distribution, token relationship, and characteristics of token creation and decentralized exchanges. In addition, we propose an algorithm to reveal potential relationships between tokens and other addresses on Ethereum.

At the same time, there are underutilized computing resources within cities and local edge-computing deployments. Using these slack resources may enable significantly lower pricing than comparable cloud computing; such resources would incur minimal marginal expenditure since their deployment and operation are mostly sunk costs. However, there are challenges associated with using these resources. First, they are not effectively aggregated or provisioned. Second, there is a lack of trust between customers and suppliers of computing resources, given that they are distinct stakeholders and behave according to their own interests. Third, delays in processing inputs may diminish the value of the applications. To resolve these chal-lenges, we introduce an architecture combining a distributed trusted computing mechanism, such as a blockchain, with an efficient messaging system like Apache Pulsar. Using this architecture, we design a decentralized computation market where customers and suppliers make offers to deploy and host applications. The proposed architecture can be realized using any trusted computing mechanism that supports smart contracts, and any messaging framework with the necessary features. This combination ensures that the market is robust without incurring the input processing delays that limit other blockchain based solutions. We evaluate the market protocol using game-theoretic analysis to show that deviation from the protocol is discouraged. Finally, we assess the performance of a prototype implementation based on experiments with a streaming computer-vision application.","","978-1-6654-9115-0","10.1109/IC2E55432.2022.00012","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1952011); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9946336","smart contract;blockchain;game theory;decentralized market;computation outsourcing","Trusted computing;Cloud computing;Costs;Urban areas;Computer architecture;Outsourcing;Delays","cloud computing;contracts;game theory;grid computing;outsourcing;pricing;resource allocation;security of data;trusted computing","comparable cloud computing;decentralized computation market;distributed trusted computing mechanism;infrastructure operators;input processing delays;local edge-computing deployments;minimal marginal expenditure;outsourcing computation;slack resources;stream processing applications;streaming computer-vision application;underutilized computing resources","","","","28","IEEE","16 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Second, an image watermark algorithm will inevitably lead to the loss of image data when operating on the image data, while it is usually irreversible. The zero-watermark algorithm can solve the problem of data loss but relies more on the trusted third party than a traditional digital watermark, which makes its prospects limited. With the development of blockchain technology in recent years, its features of de-trusted third parties combine the fairness and process automation of smart contracts to make up for the shortcomings of the zero-watermarking algorithm. This paper studies image storage and authentication frameworks. This framework utilizes the advantages of zero-watermarking algorithm and blockchain, using the Inter-Planetary File System to solve the data expansion problem of blockchain, which well avoids the shortcomings of zero-watermarking algorithm and blockchain.

In this article, we present the chronicles of EdgeChain network, a proof of concept demo of a blockchain-based model for secure and private task sharing collaboration specially designed for edge computing servers. EdgeChain operates on a decentralized approach that counts on the blockchain services provided by the Hyperledger Fabric platform. The network offers enhanced security features that leverage the permissioned nature of Fabric, more specifically, it relies on Fabric’s membership service to validate identities and allowed behavior of participant nodes in the network. This design choice restrains external attackers from interfering with the normal operation of the task sharing scheme. The network also offers enhanced privacy features powered by a smart contract design that makes use of multiple decoupled Fabric channels with separate operation rules, ledgers, and peer-to-peer communication networks. This design choice guarantees that the computational tasks circulating in the network are only exposed to servers participating in task sharing services. The trait prevents other servers in the network to have access to private tasks and their data.

However, behind the high efficiency, the mobile crowdsensing technology used for data transmission still has the risk of leaking the privacy of task and patient information. To this end, this article proposes a privacy-enhanced multi-area task assignment strategy, named PMTA. Specifically, we use deep differential privacy to add noise to patient data, and then put the noise-added dataset into a deep Q-network for training, combined with a spectral clustering algorithm, to obtain an optimal classification strategy. Further, in order to address the problem of data silos, we adopt federated learning to jointly train the classification models of different hospitals to obtain a global model and realize data sharing among different hospitals. Finally, we use the optimal classification of patients for task deployment on the blockchain, and limit patients to only apply for tasks of the corresponding level through the smart contract technology, so as to protect task privacy. Experimental results show that our strategy can not only effectively protect task and patient privacy, but also achieve better system performance.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2022.3189439","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1905211,61702103); Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province(grant numbers:2020J01167,2020J01169); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9822973","Blockchain;deep differential privacy;federated learning;Healthcare 4.0;Internet of Things (IoT);mobile crowdsensing","Task analysis;Data privacy;Medical services;Data models;Servers;Blockchains;Hospitals","blockchains;contracts;data privacy;health care;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);medical information systems;mobile computing;pattern clustering","classification models;continuous development;data silos;data transmission;deep differential privacy;deep Q-network;different hospitals;great convenience;Healthcare 4;limit patients;mobile crowdsensing technology;named PMTA;noise-added dataset;optimal classification strategy;patient data;patient information;patient privacy;privacy-enhanced multiarea task allocation strategy;privacy-enhanced multiarea task assignment strategy;smart contract technology;spectral clustering algorithm;task deployment;task privacy;timely diagnosis","","","","31","IEEE","8 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This innovative solution helps establish a decentralized and drum-resistant headline through the question of data silos between organisms and authority consolidation. Nevertheless, the use of fungible tokens should represent complicated traceability operations; a new model for the projection of digital and physical goods on a blockchain is discussed. In the present token architecture, however, there is no powerful model to restore history. Blockchain explorers, which are central trustworthy actors, are the most common means for extracting past information on tokens. Any headers of the block can only be naively verified, but it takes a lot of time. According to preliminary calculations, restoring the previous 1,030 tokens on the Ethereum main net would take about 57 minutes. Challenge of this system is to eliminate competition for new chain blocks and Transactions may be handled quicker with simultaneous node development. It can be proposed that a directed acyclic graph (DAG) token definition which allows the token history to be quickly discovered, without looking at the entire blockchain. The model connects any token state from time to time and covers concepts like fusion and breakup. The implementation and assessment suggest the major enhancements to the reliability of the transitional history analysis in the DAG-based token architecture. The outcome demonstrates that the discovery of 1,030 tokens can be done in seconds and that the method maintains long-term success even though the block chain expands.","","979-8-3503-9720-8","10.1109/ICIDCA56705.2023.10099935","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10099935","Acyclic-Direct-Diagram;Token Architecture;Etherum;Smart Contracts;Supply Chain","Quality control;Length measurement;Time measurement;Real-time systems;Organisms;Blockchains;History","blockchains;cryptocurrencies;directed graphs;quality control","authority consolidation;blockchain explorers;blockchain quality control;central trustworthy actors;chain blocks;DAG-based token architecture;data silos;decentralized drum-resistant headline;digital goods;directed acyclic graph token definition;Ethereum main net;fungible tokens;graph-based assets;logistics;physical goods;preliminary calculations;shipping;simultaneous node development;token history;token state;traceability operations;transitional history analysis","","","","15","IEEE","20 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, these devices face many challenges due to the limited resources in terms of storage and computation. Collaborative Edge Computing (CEC) is an emerging paradigm that solves these issues where multiple edge devices share computational resources to collaborate and satisfy user requirements. The fundamental issues in CEC are to make an offloading decision while considering the flow scheduling and balancing the load over multiple edge devices. Moreover, the efficient resource allocation of edge nodes is challenging, particularly when IoT devices are more vulnerable and become resource-hungry. The combination of Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Blockchain (BC) can play a vital role in solving the issues mentioned above. This paper presents a token-based resource management mechanism as SDBlockEdge by integrating these two technologies. The programming abstractions and global view of the SDN can help offload decision and flow scheduling, whereas the smart contract mechanism of BC can help control the abnormal behavior of IoT devices. We design the Resource Management Controller (RMC), which collaborates with the SDN controller to keep the record of available resources. It helps for offloading decisions and balancing the load over edge servers, whereas the SDN controller helps consider the less loaded path, while offloading reduces the task completion time. Moreover, the resources are allocated against tokens, and smart contracts are used to pay the cost of these resources. The proposed approach is implemented in Mininet_WiFi and Containernet, where docker hosts act as edge nodes with different IoT devices. The results after the extensive simulation show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2022.3184689","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); Ministry of Science and ICT of the Korea Government(grant numbers:2020R1A2B5B01001758); Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP); Ministry of Science and ICT of the Korea Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:2021-0-00590); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9810819","Software defined networking (SDN);Internet of Things (IoT);blockchain;edge computing;resource management","Internet of Things;Task analysis;Servers;Behavioral sciences;Smart contracts;Blockchains;Software defined networking","blockchains;cloud computing;Internet of Things;resource allocation;scheduling;software defined networking","SDN controller;offloading decision;edge servers;edge nodes;IoT devices;SDBlockEdge;collaborative edge computing;CEC;multiple edge devices;computational resources;flow scheduling;token-based resource management mechanism;offload decision;SDN-blockchain enabled multihop task offloading;Internet of Things;resource allocation;software defined networking;resource management controller","","3","","44","IEEE","29 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The resulting filtered data series express load and prices as percentage deviations from their annual moving averages. Next, we develop a nonlinear, almost-periodic model that uses the 90-day moving average of the filtered price data and purely timedependent periodic terms to model the cyclicality of the 90-day moving average of the filtered load. In a final modeling step, we model the noisy model residuals using autoregressive (AR) regressions. We conclude by performing out-of-sample forecasts of our model using test data from 2019 and 2020.

The scheme exploits the advantages of deep-Q-network (DQN) and minimizes the search state explosion through a reward-penalty framework. A dynamic allocation of unallocated resource blocks (RBs) to mobile units (MUs) is carried out and once the allocation of RBs is complete, we integrate blockchain (BC) to record the transactional ledgers. The resource usage of MUs is recorded through smart contracts (SCs). We model the proposed scheme as a convex optimization problem, and subproblems are decomposed into a Pareto-optimal solution via Techebyecheff decomposition. In the simulation, we compare our scheme against FSA, and fifth-generation (5G) based DSA schemes like reinforcement learning (RL), deep neural networks (DNN)-based, and duelling DQN based schemes. The comparative analysis of 6G-DQN is modeled in terms of reward formulation, scalability of 6G-DQN-assisted DSA, and profit scenarios of BC-based allocation through intelligent channel control. The scheme proposes significant findings, with the best fit learning rate of 0.0001, and takes 500 episodes to converge to 60 total resource blocks. The servicing latency of the scheme is 272.4 ms, compared to 2010 ms in the duelling DQN approach. In spectrum allocation, an improvement of 26.32% is observed against non-DQN approaches, and 13.57% in the fairness parameter for spectrum allocation due to BC inclusion.

Furthermore, our market model allows buyers to have heterogeneous preferences (product differentiation) over the energy sellers, which can be economic, social, or environmental. To address the problem of scalability in coalitional games, we design a novel distributed negotiation mechanism that utilizes the geometric structure of the equilibrium solution to improve the convergence speed. Our algorithm enables market participants (prosumers) to reach a consensus on a set of “stable” and “fair” bilateral contracts which encourages prosumer participation. The negotiation process is executed with virtually minimal information requirements on a time-varying communication network that in turn preserves privacy. We use operator-theoretic tools to rigorously prove its convergence.

An indispensable service of crowdsourcing systems is task recommendation, which means tasks should be accurately recommended to the workers with aligned interests. However, existing systems rely on their separate servers to conduct recommendation services, resulting in computing resources locked inside each isolated system. Moreover, due to the wide attacking surfaces of traditional centralized servers setting, existing systems are subject to single points of failure or malicious data breaches. Therefore, failure to address these inherent limitations properly will hinder the wide adoption of crowdsourcing. In this article, we propose and implement FedCrowd, the first federated and privacy-preserving crowdsourcing platform by using blockchain technology. Our main idea is to employ the smart contract as a trusted platform for systems to release encrypted tasks, and carefully craft matching protocols to enable efficient task recommendations in the ciphertext domain.

Still, most existing triangular crowdsourcing systems only work under the centralized trust assumption and suffer from various attacks mounted by malicious users. Although incorporating the emerging blockchain technology into crowdsourcing provides a possibility to mitigate some of the issues, how to concretely implement the crucial components and their functionalities in a verifiable and privacy-aware manner remains unaddressed. In this article, we present BRPC, a blockchain-based decentralized system for general crowdsourcing. BRPC integrates the confident-aware truth discovery algorithm to provide task requesters with reliable task truths while evaluating each worker’s data quality. To mitigate the biased evaluation of malicious requesters, we propose a privacy-aware verification protocol leveraging the threshold Paillier cryptosystem, with which a certain number of workers can collaboratively verify the evaluation results without knowing any sensory data. Furthermore, we define the three roles of a user and elaborate a comprehensive reputation evaluation model enforced by smart contracts for its trustworthy running. Financial and social incentives are both offered to motivate users’ honest participation. Finally, we implement a prototype of BRPC and deploy it on the Ethereum blockchain. Theoretical analyses and experiment results show its security and practicality.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3097950","NSF(grant numbers:1717197,2007083); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB1400700); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1736216); Danish Ministry of Education and Science, Digital Pilot Hub and Skylab Digital; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9490332","Blockchain;crowdsourcing;privacy;truth discovery (TD);verifiability","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Blockchains;Reliability;Data integrity;Cryptography;Smart contracts","blockchains;crowdsourcing;data privacy;protocols;trusted computing","privacy-aware crowdsourcing;fairness assurance;static sensor-enabled data sensing paradigm;cost efficiency;flexibility;centralized trust assumption;malicious users;verifiable privacy-aware manner;BRPC;blockchain-based decentralized system;general crowdsourcing;confident-aware truth discovery algorithm;task requesters;reliable task truths;biased evaluation;malicious requesters;privacy-aware verification protocol;threshold Paillier cryptosystem;sensory data;comprehensive reputation evaluation model;Ethereum blockchain;blockchain technology;triangular crowdsourcing","","4","","40","IEEE","19 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In CDT, the data requesters publish crowdsensing tasks with specific data requirements, and then workers complete these tasks, upload the data and obtain corresponding rewards. To efficiently deal with data trading, most of the existing CDT systems assume a trusted centralized platform. However, we argue that the platform may collude with workers or requesters to trick others for achieving more benefits. For example, according to the workers’ uploaded data, the platform can modify the reward functions by colluding with the requester. Similarly, the platform might collude with workers to let them know the reward function, then workers could forge data. Meanwhile, requesters and workers may also be malicious. For example, requesters may post tasks but fail to pay and workers can upload wrong data to mislead the system. To solve the above problems, we combine the Crowdsensed Data Trading system with intelligent Blockchain (CDT-B), which contains a smart contract called CDToken. As a credible third-party, the CDToken is used to record the requesters’ reward function and workers’ data uploading function to avoid targeted trick. At the same time, we not only design a Data Uploading and Preprocessing (DUP) mechanism in CDToken to collect and process the workers’ sensed data, but also propose a Grouping Truth Discovery (GTD) to evaluate their data quality for determining the payments. Moreover, to hold a large number of requesters and workers in CDT-B, we propose a Layered Sharding blockchain based on Membership Degree (LSMD) to solve the blockchain inefficiency problem. Finally, we deploy CDToken to an experimental environment based on Ethereum and demonstrate its efficient performance and practicability.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2022.3213331","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021ZD0112501,2021ZD0112502); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62102161,61772230,61972450); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2021T140261,2021M701389); China Computer Federation (CCF)-Baidu Open Fund(grant numbers:2021PP15002000); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9927241","Intelligent blockchain;crowdsensed data trading;truth discovery;sharding","Blockchains;Task analysis;Smart contracts;Data integrity;Crowdsensing;Privacy;Information technology","blockchains","blockchain inefficiency problem;CDT systems;CDT-B;CDToken;crowdsensed data trading system with intelligent blockchain;crowdsensing tasks;data quality;data requesters;data requirements;data trading paradigm;Data Uploading;layered sharding blockchain based on membership degree;LSMD;reward function","","1","","49","IEEE","21 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based MCS platform, namely BlockSense, to replace the traditional triangular architecture of MCS models by a decentralized paradigm. To achieve the goal of trustworthiness of BlockSense, we present a novel consensus protocol, namely Proof-of-Data (PoD), which leverages miners to conduct useful data quality validation work instead of “useless” hash calculation. Meanwhile, in order to preserve the privacy of the sensory data, we design a homomorphic data perturbation scheme, through which miners can verify data quality without knowing the contents of the data. We have implemented a prototype of BlockSense and conducted case studies on campus, collecting over 7,000 data from workers' mobile phones. Both simulations and real-world experiments show that BlockSense can not only improve system security, preserve data privacy and guarantee incentives fairness, but also achieve at least 5.6x faster than Ethereum smart contracts in verification efficiency.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2022.3230758","NSFC(grant numbers:62141220,61972253,U1908212,72061127001,62172276,61972254); Program for Professor of Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar) at Shanghai Institutions of Higher Learning, Open Research Projects of Zhejiang Lab(grant numbers:2022NL0AB01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9996146","Mobile crowdsensing;Blockchain;Verifiable computation;Proof of useful work;Consensus;Privacy","Blockchains;Task analysis;Security;Data privacy;Smart contracts;Data integrity;Crowdsensing","","","","","","","IEEE","21 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Accordingly, this paper proposes a Privacy-Preserving Searchable Encryption (PPSE) scheme based on public and private blockchains. First, we store an encrypted index in a private blockchain while outsourcing corresponding encrypted documents to a public blockchain. The encrypted documents are located through the encrypted index. This method can reduce the storage overhead on the blockchains, and improve the efficiency of transaction execution and the security of stored data. Moreover, we adopt a smart contract to introduce a secondary verification access control mechanism and restrict data users' access to the private blockchain through authorization for the purpose of guaranteeing data privacy and the correctness of access control verification. Finally, the security analysis and experimental results indicate that compared with existing schemes, the proposed scheme can not only improve the security of encrypted data but also guarantee the efficiency of the query.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2021.9010070","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972073); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9837019","private blockchain;public blockchain;access control;forward privacy;backward privacy","Data privacy;Privacy;Smart contracts;Prototypes;Blockchains;Outsourcing;Encryption","blockchains;data privacy;search problems","data outsourcing;data modification;private information leakage;searchable encryption technology;keyword searches;encrypted data;uncontrollable query results;public blockchains;private blockchains;encrypted index;encrypted documents;secondary verification access control mechanism;data users;data privacy;access control verification;security analysis;privacy-preserving searchable encryption scheme","","1","","28","","21 Jul 2022","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

To handle these two challenges, we propose a framework of Joint Incentive design and Resource Allocation (JIRA) for edge-based real-time video streaming systems. Technically, to ensure the trust and automatic distribution of incentives, we develop a novel smart contract based incentive mechanism and implement a prototype. Meanwhile, we propose an efficient online algorithm, i.e., JIRA, which dynamically adjusts compression ratio, offloading decision, and resource allocation to achieve performance optimization for video streaming under long-term latency and resource constraints. Specifically, JIRA is based on Lyapunov optimization, which decomposes the challenging long-term decision problem into a series of real-time optimization problems. Then we propose a multi-cut Generalized Benders Decomposition based algorithm (MGA) to tackle the non-convexity of the decomposed problem. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we prove the performance bound of JIRA. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed schemes can achieve an efficient trade-off between accuracy performance and energy consumption.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2022.3215140","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1806700,2022YFB4500300); Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61972246,61932014); Key Research and Development Program of Jiangsu(grant numbers:BE2020026,2022PI0AC01,62271452,2107216,CNS-2128368,CMMI-2222810); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9929283","Lyapunov optimization;resource allocation;video streaming;smart contract","Servers;Task analysis;Streaming media;Energy consumption;Wireless communication;Real-time systems;Metadata","","","","","","33","IEEE","25 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, we leverage our proposed lightweight encryption and task allocation to build an efficient and privacy-preserving knowledge discovery protocol in order to securely calculate the data quality and truthful knowledge. To promise user reliability in the incentive scheme, we utilize the Dirichlet distribution to realize the automatic reputation prediction based on the data quality by deploying the reputation management on the blockchain. Moreover, we also deploy the payment management on the blockchain, endowing the incentive scheme to reward participants based on the data quality automatically. Through a detailed security analysis, we demonstrate that data privacy and task privacy are well preserved during the whole process.

To reveal the real-world entities behind pseudonymous blockchain accounts and recover stolen funds from massive transaction data, much effort has recently been put into tracing illicit financial flows in blockchain by academia and industry. However, most of the current blockchain fund tracing methods are heuristics and taint analysis methods that are designed on the basis of expert experience and specific events, which have limitations in terms of universality, effectiveness and efficiency. This paper models blockchain transaction records as a transaction graph and tackles blockchain transaction tracing as a graph search task. To achieve efficient and effective tracing of fund transfers on the transaction graphs, we propose a scalable transaction tracing tool, TRacer, which to the best of our knowledge is the first intelligent transaction tracing tool that is generalized to multiple account-based blockchain platforms and can handle complex transaction behavior in decentralized finance (DeFi). Particularly, we tackle the transaction tracing task via a subgraph searching approach which employ a novel ranking method to infer the relevance between accounts during the graph search process in the multi-relational blockchain transaction graph. Theoretical analysis and experimental results on datasets from multiple blockchain platforms demonstrate that TRacer can efficiently perform the transaction tracing task at a lower cost and achieve better tracing results than existing methods or even expert manual audits.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2023.3266162","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1006002); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61973325); Natural Science Foundations of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2021A1515011661); Guangzhou Basic and Applied Basic Research Project(grant numbers:202102020616); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10098630","Blockchain;transaction tracing;personalized PageRank;local community discovery","Blockchains;Task analysis;Bitcoin;Industries;Behavioral sciences;Smart contracts;Scalability","","","","","","40","IEEE","10 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To fully exploit the growth potential of the IoV and overcome the challenges of effective communication, the concept of mobile edge computing has been applied to the IoV field, namely, vehicular edge computing (VEC). Nonetheless, a series of security issues have appeared due to the explosive growth of various vehicular service data in the VEC. As a result, the security and conditional privacy of the VEC have become an urgent research hotspot. While several authentication schemes have been proposed to address secure communication in the VEC, most of them typically suffer from key escrow issues and lack conditional traceability and a decentralized datacenter. Thus, a blockchain-based conditional privacy-preserving authentication protocol with implicit certificates for vehicular edge computing is proposed in this paper. Furthermore, we provided formal security analysis using the formal security verification tool and informal security analysis to demonstrate that our designed protocol is secure and resilient against several security attacks. The performance evaluation results show that our protocol can meet security requirements while reducing computing and communication overheads compared with the existing protocols.","","978-1-6654-8711-5","10.1109/ICCCBDA55098.2022.9778897","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9778897","Blockchain (BC);Smart contract;Implicit cer-tificates;Conditional privacy-preserving authentication (CPPA);Vehicular edge computing (VEC)","Performance evaluation;Cloud computing;Technological innovation;Privacy;Protocols;Multi-access edge computing;Authentication","blockchains;cloud computing;computer centres;cryptographic protocols;distributed processing;formal verification;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","informal security analysis;security attacks;security requirements;communication overheads;vehicular edge computing;mobile edge computing;IoV field;VEC;security issues;vehicular service data;secure communication;lack conditional traceability;formal security analysis;formal security verification tool;conventional cloud based vehicular networks;blockchain based conditional privacy preserving authentication protocol","","1","","20","IEEE","26 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We prove that such price menus can incentivize EVs to truthfully reveal their departure time. We then analyze the properties of the optimal price menu with complete EV information, i.e., social optimality and first-degree price discrimination. For the incomplete information case, we first design a systematic method to estimate the utility and demand information for a large population of EVs based on EV behavior data.

Therefore, creating accurate service case classification models is imperative to simplify the classification process. The service cases consisted of four levels: series, critical, moderate, and low. We employed natural language processing (NLP) to develop a more efficient priority level of service for the organization. We implemented the weighting of the term frequency - inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) method and cosine Similarity with the measuring degree concept of similarity terms within each service case. The model consisted of four processes: data collection, preprocessing, TF-IDF calculation, and similarity and scoring calculation. The model presented here improved the accuracy of the classified process and produced better results in the test sets, measuring the efficiency from the cosine similarity.

To that end, recent work has shown the benefit of Multi-stage Transaction architectures. The benefit of such systems is that they provide requested data quickly to the client while still ensuring that accurate results are eventually returned. In this paper, we describe a prototype of a multi-stage transaction system, which we call Friend in Mobile Edge (FiME), that intelligently coordinates client requests between a Blockchain and a central cloud node. We select the use case of stock price prediction and evaluate based on response time to the client as well as computational load on the various components.

By their intrinsic nature, public keys are meant to be accessible to any interested party willing to verify a given signature. Thus, the storing of such keys is of great concern, since an adversary shall not be able to tamper with the public keys, e.g., on a local filesystem. Commonly used public-key infrastructures (PKIs), which handle the key distribution and storage, are not feasible in most use-cases, due to their resource intensity and high complexity. Thus, the general storing of the public verification keys is of notable interest for low-resource loT networks. By using the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), this paper proposes a decentralized concept for storing public signature verification keys in a tamper-resistant, secure, and resilient manner. By combining lightweight public-key exchange protocols with the proposed approach, the storing of verification keys becomes scalable and especially suitable for low-resource loT devices. This paper provides a Proof-of-Concept implementation of the DLT public-key store by extending our previously proposed NFC-Key Exchange (NFC-KE) protocol with a decentralized Hyperledger Fabric public-key store. The provided performance analysis shows that by using the decentralized keystore, the NFC- KE protocol gains an increased tamper resistance and overall system resilience while also showing expected performance degradations with a low real-world impact.","2376-6506","978-1-6654-6749-0","10.1109/IWCMC55113.2022.9824878","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9824878","loT;Distributed Ledger Technology;Public-Key;file storage;tamper-resistance","Wireless communication;Resistance;Protocols;Distributed ledger;Smart contracts;Public key;Performance analysis","computer network security;cryptographic protocols;digital signatures;Internet of Things;public key cryptography","decentralized concept;loT networks;decentralized hyperledger fabric public key store;NFC-key exchange protocol;public signature verification keys;public verification keys;key distribution;public key infrastructures;public verification key;private signature;digital cryptographic signatures;distributed ledger technology;decentralizing loT public- Key storage;DLT public-key store;low-resource loT devices;public key exchange protocols","","1","","14","IEEE","19 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to the high security requirements in IoV scenarios, the security threats of blockchain itself become a big challenge for its applications in IoV. As the largest distributed platform supporting smart contract, Ethereum becomes one of the popular blockchain platforms that has been applied in IoV applications. In Ethereum, the local world state (stored on Road Side Units (RSUs) in IoV) is applied to facilitate account query and transaction verification. However, previous works showed that the local database can be easily tampered, so attackers may issue invalid transactions based on the modified world state, which is not acceptable for IoV applications. In this paper, the success probability and expected time for such an attack are first analyzed theoretically, including the effect of portion of tampered RSUs and the number of required confirmation blocks. Then experiment evaluation verifies the correctness of the theoretical analysis and shows that the attack would succeed with a higher probability within a shorter time when the local database on more RSUs are attacked. On the contrary, increasing of confirmation blocks can effectively reduce the success probability of a single attack and extend the confirmation time of the invalid transaction. Finally, efficient attack detection and recovery methods are proposed based on a novel hierarchical architecture with hybrid RSUs, and the effectiveness and complexity are verified by theoretical analysis and experiments.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2023.3268222","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFE0205300); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62171313); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10109192","Ethereum;world state;attack;security;Internet of Vehicles (IoV)","Blockchains;Security;Databases;Bitcoin;Smart contracts;Authentication;Road side unit","","","","","","","IEEE","26 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, it is challenging to verify the Blindcoin in a formal and automatic way. To tackle the challenges, we propose a tool-friendly symbolic model that can capture the semantics of multi-layers of Bitcoin and the features of Blindcoin.

Motivated from the aforementioned discussions, we integrate permissioned blockchain and smart contract with deep learning (DL) techniques to design a novel secure and efficient data sharing framework named PBDL. Specifically, PBDL first has a blockchain scheme to register, verify (using zero-knowledge proof), and validate the communicating entities using the smart contract-based consensus mechanism. Second, the authenticated data are used to propose a novel DL scheme that combines stacked sparse variational autoencoder (SSVAE) with self-attention-based bidirectional long short term memory (SA-BiLSTM). In this scheme, SSVAE encodes or transforms the healthcare data into new format, and SA-BiLSTM identifies and improves the attack detection process.

Enabling accountability and privacy preservation while providing secure data access control in VDF is a nontrivial challenge. To mitigate this issue, in this article, we propose a blockchain-based decentralized solution for VDF named BB-VDF, in which the accountable protocols and privacy-preserving algorithm are constructed. The desirable security properties and fine-grained data access control are achieved based on smart contract and the customized cryptographic construction. Specifically, we design a distributed key-policy attribute-based encryption scheme with partially hidden access structures, named DKP-ABE-H, to realize the secure fine-grained forensics data access control. Further, a novel smart contract is designed to model the forensics procedures as a finite state machine, which guarantees accountability that each participant performs auditable cooperation under tamper resistant and traceable transactions.

On top of this, Secure Service Level Agreements (SSLA) are introduced to ensure that SPs deliver the most critical and required security-related standards defined in the contract, such as integrity, confidentiality, availability, non-repudiation, and privacy assurance. However, with the tendency for more distributed and multi-stakeholder networking architectures in next-generation networks, the management process of such SSLAs will be challenging due to the diversified security vulnerabilities and complexity of underlying technologies. Although blockchain is emerging as a platform to facilitate such distributed SSLA/SLA management frameworks, its currently available consensus mechanisms are more generic. Still, they need to improve in terms of applying in multi-stakeholder networks. Therefore, this paper presents a novel consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Monitoring (PoM) for a blockchain-based novel SSLA management framework. Moreover, we provide details about the prototype implementation of our proposed consensus algorithm and SSLA management framework.

This paper proposes BlockChain-empowered CED (BC-CED), a blockchain-empowered collaborative task offloading for CED computing. In BC-CED, blockchain plays a central role in the main functionality of CED, including task offloading, brokerage of resource usage, and incentives. We distinguish the BC-CED from the existing solutions by modifying the blockchain consensus process, enabling the participants to reach an agreement via solving the task offloading problem. For this purpose, we formulate the offloading problem by considering the computation capabilities of candidate nodes and the network performance. BC-CED allows each participant to apply reinforcement learning-based methods to solve this problem and compete for the right of block output by comparing the offloading policy performance and accepting the best policy as the offloading scheme within the next period. We also propose a truthful incentive mechanism to encourage resource contributions in BC-CED and force them to be honest. Extensive tests by implementing our solutions in a commercialized blockchain platform have shown how BC-CED achieves a superior performance in task offloading and blockchain maintenance.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2022.3213358","China National Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists(grant numbers:61825204); NSFC Project(grant numbers:61932016,62101301,62132011,62132009); Beijing Outstanding Young Scientist Program(grant numbers:BJJWZYJH01201910003011); China Computer Federation (CCF)-Huawei Populus Euphratica Forest Fund(grant numbers:CCF-HuaweiBC2021005); Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence (CAAI)-Huawei MindSpore Open Fund under(grant numbers:CAAIXSJLJJ-2020-014A); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2021M691787); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9933642","Cloud-edge-device computing;task offloading;blockchain;reinforcement learning","Task analysis;Blockchains;Resource management;Optimization;Delays;Reinforcement learning;Smart contracts","blockchains;cloud computing;groupware;incentive schemes;mobile computing;reinforcement learning","BC-CED;blockchain consensus process;blockchain-empowered CED;blockchain-empowered collaborative task offloading;CED computing;cloud-edge-device computing;high-performance task offloading;incentive mechanism;reinforcement learning-based methods","","1","","37","IEEE","31 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We first obtain the account labels from an authority site and the transaction records from Ethereum on-chain blocks. Then we extract ego-graphs for each labeled account to represent it. To learn representations for ego-graphs, we utilize non-linear substructures sampled from ego-graphs and use a skip-gram model. Finally, a classifier is applied to graph embeddings to predict phishing accounts. To overcome the limit that transaction attributes are not encoded into ego-graph embeddings, we give nodes and subgraphs with richer attribute-based semantics. Specifically, we propose a novel node relabeling strategy based on Ethereum transaction attributes including transaction amount, number, and direction, and differentiating nodes and subgraphs by new labels. Through this, structural and attributed features of the Ethereum transaction networks can be learned at the same time. Experimental results show that our framework achieves effective performance on class imbalanced phishing detection on Ethereum.","1558-3791","","10.1109/TCSII.2022.3159594","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1006005); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61973325); Natural Science Foundations of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2021A1515011661); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9734737","Ethereum;blockchain;phishing;network embedding","Phishing;Blockchains;Feature extraction;Task analysis;Data mining;Smart contracts;Computer crime","computer crime;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;Web sites","attributed ego-graph embedding;phishing scams;phishing detection scenario;network embedding;phishing accounts;account labels;ego-graphs;labeled account;transaction attributes;ego-graph embeddings;richer attribute-based semantics;Ethereum transaction networks;class imbalanced phishing detection","","1","","17","IEEE","15 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we construct a blockchain-based privacy-preserving and rewarding private data-sharing scheme (BPRPDS) for IoT. A privacy issue worth considering is that the malicious cloud server may establish a behavior profile database of data users (DUs). In the case of anonymity, the transactions of private data sharing are easy to cause disputes. When anonymous DUs are framed, it is hard to protect their rights. With the help of the deniable ring signature and Monero, we realize the behavior profile building prevention and nonframeability of BPRPDS. At the same time, we utilize the licensing technology executed by smart contracts to ensure flexible access control of multisharing. The proposed BPRPDS is provably secure. Performance analysis and experimental results show that BPRPDS is efficient and practical.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3147925","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872192,61972294,61932016,U21A20466); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9698094","Anonymity;blockchain;data sharing;ring signature","Blockchains;Security;Data privacy;Smart contracts;Access control;Internet of Things;Servers","authorisation;blockchains;cloud computing;data privacy;digital signatures;Internet of Things","blockchain-based privacy-preserving scheme;Internet of Things devices;IoT devices;blockchain technology;rewarding private data-sharing scheme;BPRPDS;data users;behavior profile building prevention;nonframeability;access control;malicious cloud server;deniable ring signature","","14","","48","IEEE","31 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, with the increasing popularity of verifiable computations, existing verification schemes are yet not efficient and cannot cater to different scenarios in practice. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based verifiable search framework in the adversarial cloud outsourcing context.

Once a user is authorized, he/she can flexibly obtain the query results and efficiently check the query integrity via the pre-deployed smart contract, without the need of the data owner being online.

Users and cloud service providers (CSP) deploy smart contracts on the main chain and sub-chains. Intensive and frequent computing work is transferred to the sub-chain for completion, and the computation results of the sub-chain are submitted to the main chain periodically or when needed to ensure its finality. The concept of non-interactive audit is introduced to avoid affecting user experience due to the communication with the CSP during the audit process. In order to ensure data security, a reward pool mechanism is introduced. Comprehensive analysis from aspects such as storage, batch auditing and data consistency proves the correctness of the scheme.

This protocol collocates authenticated information of a manufacturer with its exclusive blockchain address to generate an initial transaction block. The blockchain is then used to trace the original product manufacturers to prevent counterfeiting, and a grouping proof is employed to prevent disputes regarding transfer comprehensiveness. The proposed protocol was capable of resisting common off-chain radio frequency identification ownership transfer attacks, indicating its security. A security testing tool was employed to prove whether the on-chain smart contracts could also resist the attacks on blockchain. The analysis and experiment results revealed that the proposed protocol required fewer messages for ownership transfer and half the calculation time compared with the existing protocols.

Primarily, the lack of inbuilt guarantees of honest behavior of participating, such as end-users or cloud behaving maliciously may result in disputes. Given such challenges, we propose a fair, accountable, and secure data sharing scheme, FairShare for IIoT. In this scheme, data collected from IoT devices are processed and stored in cloud servers with intermediate fog nodes facilitating computation. Authorized clients can access this data against some fee to make strategic decisions for improving the operational services of the IIoT system. By enabling blockchain, FairShare prevents fraudulent activities and thereby achieves fairness such that each party gets their rightful outcome in terms of data or penalty/rewards while simultaneously ensuring accountability of the services provided by the parties. Additionally, smart contracts are designed to act as a mediator during any dispute by enforcing payment settlement. Further, security and privacy of data are ensured by suitably applying cryptographic techniques like proxy re-encryption. We prove FairShare to be secure as long as at least one of the parties is honest. We validate FairShare with a theoretical overhead analysis. We also build a prototype in Ethereum to estimate performance and justify comparable results with a state-of-the-art scheme both via simulation and a realistic testbed setup.

With the addition of smart contracts, blockchains can track and verify arbitrary computations – which enables blockchain users to verify the provenance of information derived from data through the blockchain. This provenance comes at the cost of data confidentiality and user privacy, however, which is unacceptable for many sensitive applications. The need for verifiable yet confidential data sharing and computation has led some to add trusted execution environment (TEE) hardware to blockchain platforms. By moving sensitive operations (e.g., data decryption and analysis) off of the blockchain and into a TEE, they get both the confidentiality of TEEs and the transparency of blockchains without the need to completely trust any one party in the data-sharing ecosystem.In this paper, we build on our TEE-enabled blockchain data-sharing system, Amanuensis, to ensure the freshness of access-control lists shared between the blockchain and TEE, and to improve the privacy of users interacting within the system. We also detail how TEE-based remote attestation help us to achieve information provenance – specifically, how to achieve information provenance in the context of the Intel SGX trusted execution environment. Finally, we present an evaluation of our system, in which we test several real-world machine-learning applications (logistic regression, kNN, SVM) to determine the run-time overhead of information confidentiality and provenance. Each machine-learning program exhibited a slowdown between 1.1 and 2.8x when run inside of our confidential environment, and took an average of 59 milliseconds to verify the provenance of an input data set.","2575-8411","978-1-6654-7177-0","10.1109/ICDCS54860.2022.00023","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9912198","","Support vector machines;Data privacy;Trusted computing;Costs;Smart contracts;Prototypes;Machine learning","authorisation;blockchains;data privacy;learning (artificial intelligence);program verification;trusted computing","TEE-enabled blockchain data systems;blockchain technology;transparent audit trails;immutable audit trails;semitrusted parties;blockchain users;data confidentiality;user privacy;confidential data;trusted execution environment hardware;blockchain platforms;data decryption;data-sharing ecosystem;TEE-enabled blockchain data-sharing system;TEE-based remote attestation help;information provenance;information confidentiality;real-world machine-learning applications;logistic regression;kNN;SVM","","","","41","IEEE","13 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Combining the characteristics of blind signatures and aggregated signatures, this scheme ensures the privacy of bidders and allows the electronic auction system to generate only one blind aggregated signature, which makes the system more optimized. The smart contract is invoked as a trusted third party to build an electronic auction system to prevent malicious internal members from attacking by combining the blind aggregation signature scheme. The security analysis shows that the proposed scheme can provide security protection for the electronic auction system, such as anonymity and non-forgery.

The mainstream traditional copyright protection schemes need an authority online all the time to handle copyright issues and face some problems such as intricate copyright transfer, single point of failure and so on. To alleviate the burden of the authority, a few blockchain-based copyright protection schemes are proposed. However, most of them do not consider copyright transfer, and their infringement penalty may only happen after copyright owners discover the infringement behavior (i.e., “ex-post penalty”). In this article, we propose a new security strategy, called “Proactive Defense” in copyright protection which can prevent infringement before it occurs. With our proposed proactive defense strategy, we design a secure copyright protection scheme which provides advantages of compact copyright transfer and prior infringement penalty. More concrete, both copyright registration and transfer are regarded as transactions and recorded to the blockchain. Based on the double-authentication-prevention signature and non-interactive zero-knowledge proof techniques, illegal copyright transfer can be detected and the infringement penalty can be done automatically with a tailored smart contract before the completion of the transfer. Our security analysis shows that the proposed scheme can achieve all desirable security properties. Moreover, we implement our scheme in Java and evaluate the performance experimentally. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme has good security and efficiency, which can be applied for the copyright protection.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2023.3246476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10050765","Copyright protection;double-authentication-preventing signature;blockchain","Copyright protection;Security;Blockchains;Watermarking;Smart contracts;Faces;Behavioral sciences","","","","","","","IEEE","23 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Each entity generates and registers its own identifier and credential (public key) to the BC such that any entity can obtain the other entity’s public key. When the corresponding private key is compromised, the key rotation to generate and register a new key pair should be performed. However, the current approach for cryptographically binding a decentralized identifier with a public key induces a serious security problem that results in both identity-stealing attacks and multiple identifiers for a single entity. A new DID to address the security problem above is proposed herein, which is based on a newly proposed cryptographic primitive (infinite one-way hash chain), as well as its security analysis and performance evaluation on Hyperledger Fabric and Contiki Cooja simulator.

For this purpose, we provide a detailed analysis of the logical structure of the dominant off-chain NFTs, followed by the attack surface analysis.

To validate our findings, we experiment by minting our own NFTs on Ethereum and demonstrate that we can successfully mount the attacks with trivial or even no cost. The cause of these new attacks is rooted in the current design of NFTs where the digital assets are decoupled from the contracts deployed on the blockchains.We discuss some future research to address these vulnerabilities.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.001.2200628","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10121574","","Nonfungible tokens;Smart contracts;Metadata;Metaverse;Servers;Phishing;Logic gates","","","","","","","IEEE","8 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Merely improving the statistical quality of PIs with respect to calibration and sharpness cannot always contribute to the operational value for specific decision-making issue. In this paper, the cost-oriented prediction intervals are firstly proposed to achieve the joint improvement of forecasting quality and decision performance. In order to bridge the gap between forecasting and decision, a novel cost-oriented machine learning (COML) framework is established, which unifies nonparametric renewable power PI construction and decision-making. Formulated as a bilevel programming model, the COML minimizes the operational costs of decision-making process by adaptively adjusting the quantile proportion pair of PIs resulting from extreme learning machine based quantile regression. The hierarchical optimization model of the COML is equivalently simplified as a single level nonlinear programming problem. Then an enhanced branch-and-contract algorithm with innovative bounds contraction strategy is devised to efficiently capture the optimum of the single level problem with bilinear nonconvexity. Numerical experiments based on actual wind farm data simulate the online forecasting and decision process for wind power offering. Comprehensive comparisons verify the substantial superiority of the proposed COML methodology in terms of forecasting quality, operational value, as well as computational efficiency for practical application.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2021.3128567","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB0905000); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51877189,U2166203,U2066601); Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:LR22E070003); China Association of Science and Technology(grant numbers:2018QNRC001); Zhejiang University Academic Award; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9616458","Prediction interval;forecasting;renewable energy;decision making;uncertainty;machine learning","Forecasting;Renewable energy sources;Probabilistic logic;Uncertainty;Wind power generation;Decision making;Costs","cost reduction;decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);minimisation;nonlinear programming;power system economics;power system planning;regression analysis;renewable energy sources","COML;operational costs;extreme learning machine;single level nonlinear programming problem;operational value;cost-oriented prediction intervals;renewable energy forecasting;statistical quality;specific decision-making issue;decision performance;nonparametric renewable power PI construction;uncertainty quantification;forecasting quality;cost-oriented machine learning framework;quantile regression;hierarchical optimization model;enhanced branch-and-contract algorithm;innovative bounds contraction strategy;single level problem;bilinear nonconvexity;operational costs minimization","","4","","48","IEEE","16 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Emergency message dissemination is usually carried out by broadcasting. However, high vehicle density and mobility lead to challenges in message dissemination such as broadcasting storm and low probability of packet reception. This paper proposes a federated learning based blockchain-assisted message dissemination solution. Similar to the incentive-based Proof-of-Work consensus in blockchain, vehicles compete to become a relay node (miner) by processing the proposed Proof-of-Federated-Learning (PoFL) consensus which is embedded in the smart contract of blockchain. Both theoretical and practical analysis of the proposed solution are provided. Specifically, the proposed blockchain based federated learning results in more vehicles uploading their models in a given time, which can potentially lead to a more accurate model in less time as compared to the same solution without using blockchain. It also outperforms other blockchain approaches in reducing 65.2% of time delay in consensus, improving at least 8.2% message delivery rate and preserving privacy of neighbor vehicle more efficiently. The economic model to incentivize vehicles participating in federated learning and message dissemination is further analyzed using Stackelberg game. The analysis of asymptotic complexity proves PoFL as the most scalable solution compared to other consensus algorithms in vehicular networks.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2021.3132226","European Union’s Horizon 2020 research, and innovation programme; Marie Skłodowska-Curie(grant numbers:101006411); Newton Advanced Fellowship(grant numbers:62061130221); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U20A20155,61822101,62173012); Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:L191001); A*STAR; RIE2020 Advanced Manufacturing, and Engineering (AME) Industry Alignment Fund–Pre Positioning (IAF-PP)(grant numbers:A19D6a0053); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9633160","Blockchain;federated learning;smart contract","Biological system modeling;Blockchains;Relays;Fuzzy logic;Economics;Data models;Analytical models","data privacy;game theory;information dissemination;learning (artificial intelligence);probability;road safety;road vehicles;vehicular ad hoc networks","mobility lead;blockchain-assisted message dissemination solution;incentive-based Proof-of-Work consensus;federated learning results;blockchain approaches;neighbor vehicle;vehicular networks;message exchange;emergency message dissemination;high vehicle density;Proof-of-Federated-Learning consensus;proof-of-federated-learning consensus","","12","","48","IEEE","2 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Consequently, medical practitioners can now virtually examine the patient's health and provide immediate medications. However, when the security of this equipment is considered, there is a grave hazard. The data is delivered across an open channel, i.e., the internet, from the patient's device to the doctor, and it may be tampered with by intruders. Insurance firms keep a record of their patient's health and subsequently offer appropriate treatments. In case of data tampering, the insurer will consider the conduct fraudulent. As a result, ensuring the system's integrity and granting access only to authorized stakeholders becomes critical. Blockchain has surpassed conventional technologies in terms of guaranteeing security for information held. Motivated by these, this paper has developed a novel approach that uses blockchain technology to transmit a patient's health information to a medical expert.

However, conventional centralized architecture of such dynamic IoT spectrum-sharing systems is often considered to be nontransparent, costly, and vulnerable to potential attacks and single-point failures. To address the aforementioned issues, a blockchain-based dynamic spectrum-sharing scheme has been proposed and investigated in this work, which aims at enhancing the system by providing desirable features, such as decentralization, transparency, immutability, and auditability. By considering the privacy and transaction dynamics issues when blockchain is integrated into spectrum-sharing systems, a privacy-preserving double auction mechanism based on differential privacy is developed for incentivizing spectrum sharing, where the time-varying valuations of the spectrum resources are also taken into consideration. In the proposed auction, a winner determination problem (WDP) is formulated to decide the winning bidders and spectrum allocation. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based method is then proposed for efficiently solving the WDP. The proposed auction mechanism can be integrated with smart contracts on blockchain platforms. Furthermore, the computation of the DRL-based method for solving the WDP is designed as part of the consensus mechanism in the blockchain. Theoretical analysis show that the proposed privacy-aware double auction mechanism satisfies the properties of differential privacy, individual rationality, and truthfulness.

In response to this problem, researchers have introduced blockchain to realize decentralized e-voting, but the adoption of blockchain also brings new issues in terms of flexibility, anonymity, and usability. To this end, in this paper, we propose WeVoting, which provides weight-based flexibility with solid anonymity and enhances usability by designing a voter-independent on-chain counting mechanism. Specifically, we use distributed ElGamal homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proof to achieve voting anonymity with weight. Besides, WeVoting develops a counter-based counting mechanism to enhance usability compared with those self-tallying schemes. By critically designing an honesty-and-activity-based incentive algorithm, WeVoting can guarantee a correct counting result even in the presence of malicious counters. Our security and performance analyses elaborate that WeVoting achieves high anonymity in weighed voting under the premise of meeting the basic security requirements of e-voting. And meanwhile, its counting mechanism is sufficient for practical demands with reasonable overheads.","","978-1-6654-3540-6","10.1109/GLOBECOM48099.2022.10001590","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972371); Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:Y202093); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10001590","Blockchain;Weighted E-voting;Counting Mecahnism;Smart Contract","Privacy;Resists;Organizations;Solids;Blockchains;Performance analysis;Security","blockchains;government data processing","blockchain-based weighted e-voting;centralized organization;correct counting result;decentralized e-voting;democracy;ElGamal homomorphic encryption;high anonymity;honest-and-activity-based incentive algorithm;self-tallying schemes;social fairness;solid anonymity;traditional e-voting schemes;vote-counting results;voter anonymity;voter-independent on-chain counting mechanism;weighed voting;weight-based flexibility;WeVoting;zero-knowledge proof","","","","15","IEEE","11 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Employees perform well only when their skill set matches their job requirements. However, the current recruitment system fails to provide a single solution that verifies employee records and predicts employee-job compatibility. This paper proposes a recruitment system using blockchain, a machine learning model, and a multi-criteria decision analysis method. Here, blockchain technology is used to hold employee records in an encrypted manner, including their performance appraisals, in a decentralized system that allows data verification by supported organisations. QR code is used to verify encrypted employee records which are then decrypted within the system and used to predict their performance for the hiring company, using a classification model. Here, after comparing the performance of different classification models, the best-performing model, SVM Classification, has been used. Finally, the system ranks eligible candidates, based on employee records including their predicted performance appraisal rating, using a TOPSIS algorithm. The SVM classification model and TOPSIS algorithm are deployed in a Streamlit application, which predicts employee performance appraisal ratings and ranks candidates by generating scores using TOPSIS. The scores are then sorted from highest to lowest, therefore ranking candidates from most suitable to least suitable for a job role.","","978-1-6654-5305-9","10.1109/CSDE56538.2022.10089340","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10089340","Human Resource;Recruitment;Machine Learning;Classification;Blockchain;Ranking;Prediction;Performance Appraisal;Verification;SMOTE;Encryption;Streamlit;Hyperledger Fabric;Smart Contracts","Support vector machines;Machine learning;QR codes;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Appraisal;Blockchains","blockchains;decision making;human resource management;learning (artificial intelligence);organisational aspects;personnel;QR codes;recruitment;support vector machines;TOPSIS","blockchain technology;current recruitment system;decentralized employee performance appraisal framework;decentralized system;different classification models;employee performance appraisal ratings;employee-job compatibility;encrypted employee records;encrypted manner;Human Resource Management;job requirements;job role;machine learning model;multicriteria decision analysis method;performance appraisals;performance prediction;permissioned blockchain;predicted performance appraisal rating;ranking candidates;ranks candidates;skill set;skilled employees;SVM classification model;TOPSIS algorithm;verifies employee records","","","","17","IEEE","6 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, RES generation is easily affected by the environment. Meanwhile, the load, such as electric vehicles (EVs) and prosumers, accounts for most low-carbon technology users. Their power is usually superimposed on peak loads without dispatching, which also exacerbates the instability of the power system. Current optimal dispatching mechanisms mainly rely on centralized organizations, while their dispatching process is not open and transparent. In this article, we propose a blockchain-based trustworthy dispatching approach for the distribution network in high renewable energy penetrated power systems. We first develop an optimal dispatching model considering EVs’ charging behavior and the prosumers’ economic benefits. With the model, prosumers can be dispatched to balance power and consume renewable energy, reducing the impact of disorderly charging on the grid and the abandonment of RES generation. An orderly charging iteration optimization (OCIO) algorithm is proposed to implement orderly EV charging while considering the charging cost and the period. We also propose a modified particle swarm optimization (mPSO) algorithm to publish dispatching tasks based on real-time power balance. Furthermore, blockchain is applied as an open and transparent ledger to record each entity’s power generation and consumption information, ensuring that the dispatching process is trustworthy. Finally, the effectiveness of the dispatching approach is verified in the modified IEEE 33-bus test system and Ethereum-based smart contracts.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3117924","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62002113); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9560154","Blockchain;electric vehicle (EV);optimal dispatching;prosumer;renewable energy power generation","Dispatching;Blockchains;Power system stability;Renewable energy sources;Distribution networks;Costs;Stability analysis","blockchains;distributed power generation;distribution networks;electric vehicle charging;load dispatching;particle swarm optimisation;power engineering computing;power generation dispatch;power generation economics;power grids;renewable energy sources","mPSO algorithm;OCIO algorithm;optimal dispatching mechanisms;Ethereum-based smart contracts;modified IEEE 33-bus test system;transparent ledger;open ledger;real-time power balance;modified particle swarm optimization algorithm;charging cost;orderly charging iteration optimization algorithm;EV charging behavior;optimal dispatching model;blockchain-based trustworthy dispatching approach;dispatching process;peak loads;electric vehicles;RES generation;low-carbon technology users;renewable energy sources;high renewable energy penetrated power systems;blockchain-based trustworthy energy dispatching approach","","20","","37","IEEE","6 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The authentication system is required to be distributed. However, the information interaction between traditional distributed authentication entities (AEs) is not transparent, and the use of blockchain is only to save certificate status records on the chain. There is a lack of trusted security management mechanisms between AEs, so there is a risk of collusion attacks and behavior record forgery and tamper attacks between AEs. Therefore, this paper mainly addresses the management problems of opaque interaction and insufficient security verification of distributed authentication entities in the VANETs scenario. In this paper, based on the security features of blockchain technology, such as public audit and tamper proof block structure, and distributed trust consensus, we propose a hierarchical and trust certificate service chain based on reputation value called HCSC. We have a set of safe and reliable management mechanisms between distributed authentication entities such as the Bitcoin system. First, we integrate the traditional hierarchical authentication system and the blockchain network into a new hierarchical certificate service chain. Then, we propose a reputation evaluation model based on the logistic regression model by quantifying the behavior records of the AEs. In addition, a new hierarchical reputation consensus based on delegated proof of stake (DPoS) and proof of work (PoW) is given. Then, a fast verification based on block height and security verification for the efficiency and security of certificate verification is proposed. Finally, the security analysis is given, and a prototype implementation of HCSC is developed based on Fabric. The experimental simulation and security analysis reveal that the HCSC is very efficient and suitable for the above issues.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2023.3250279","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61903056); Chongqing Research Program of Basic Research and Frontier Technology(grant numbers:cstc2019jcyj-msxmX0681); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10061353","VANETs;blockchain;certificate service;consensus mechanisms;security validation","Authentication;Blockchains;Security;Consensus algorithm;Behavioral sciences;Smart contracts;Proof of Work","","","","","","","IEEE","6 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This approach is proposed based on the FCM to model CRs between SSC-performance-related targets and enablers of BT adoption. These enablers include inherent features of BT identified in the context of sustainability (e.g., social responsibility and environmental sustainability). After developing an FCM model for the BT adoption problem, the impact of enablers on target concepts is investigated by implementing a hybrid FCM learning algorithm according to the extracted CRs. Based on the outputs of the FCM learning algorithm, this study also identifies the most effective enablers for improving SSC performance using the combined compromise solution method. The proposed system-analysis-based approach demonstrates that BT can significantly affect various dimensions of SSC networks’ performance.

Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a blockchain-based self-tallying voting protocol to achieve high available, secure and anonymous voting. More specifically, we adopt threshold secret sharing to deal with abstention problem (this is a difficult problem to solve in self-tallying voting systems). We adopt homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proof to achieve anonymity and verifiability of encrypted data.

In response, nation-states have begun to handle cyber threats at the national defense level, which is titled ‘cyber defense.’ The cyber defense sector is related to national security, therefore requires robust security technology. Contrary to normal systems, blockchain provides strong security properties without a centralized control entity, and as such its application in the cyber defense field is under the spotlight. In this paper, we present opportunities blockchain provides for cyber defense, research and national projects, and limitations. We constructed a survey of government documents, interviews, related news, technical reports, and research papers from 2016 to 2021. As a result, our research contributes to reducing the gap in blockchain for cyber defense by systematically conducting research and analysis. In our research, we found that not only research but also government-led plans are actively promoting blockchain, which demonstrates that blockchain will play a remarkable role in cyber defense.

Existing literature reviews on blockchain and sustainability often focus only on topics related to a few SDGs. There is a need to consolidate existing results in terms of SDGs and provide a comprehensive overview of the impacts that blockchain technology may have on each SDG. This paper intends to bridge this gap, presenting a tertiary review based on 42 literature reviews, to investigate the relationship between blockchain and sustainability in light of SDGs. The method used is a consensus-based expert elicitation with thematic analysis. The findings include a novel and comprehensive mapping of impact-based interlinkage of blockchain and SDGs and a systematic overview of drivers and barriers to adopting blockchain for sustainability. The findings reveal that blockchain can have a positive impact on all 17 SDGs though some negative effects can occur and impede the achievement of certain objectives. 76 positive and 10 negative linkages between blockchain adoption and the 17 SDGs as well as 45 factors that drive or hinder blockchain adoption for the achievement of SDGs have been identified.

Some governments have made considerable attempts to address this problem. Saudi Arabia, for example, has taken significant steps to utilize renewable energy (RE) sources in addition to oil and gas. Consumers are encouraged to build small RE systems. These small grids will help people meet their daily electrical energy requirements. They can sell the excess to other customers. One of the major issues is managing the distribution and sale of RE. Blockchain-based peer-to-peer (P2P) networks can help overcome several obstacles to the implementation of a distributed RE management system (DREMS). However, several impediments may still stand in the way of its execution. Scalability and productivity are two of the most important considerations. The number of transactions made to the Blockchain network will increase in lockstep with the number of energy consumers. This will result in a significant lag in response. Understanding the renewable distributed energy system will aid in minimizing the effects of these roadblocks. Therefore, this research identifies the RE systems installation approaches, and how Blockchain technology can be utilized. It provides the solution requirements of any DREMS. Moreover, it proposes a new Blockchain-based framework for DREMS. And designs selective protocols of the proposed framework.

To this end, it is especially urgent and critical to summarize and classify the financial security threats on the Web3-empowered metaverse in order to maintain the long-term healthy development of its ecology. In this paper, we first outline the background, foundation, and applications of the Web3 metaverse. Then, we provide a comprehensive overview and taxonomy of the security risks and financial crimes that have emerged since the development of the decentralized metaverse. For each financial crime, we focus on three issues: a) existing definitions, b) relevant cases and analysis, and c) existing academic research on this type of crime. Next, from the perspective of academic research and government policy, we summarize the current anti-crime measurements and technologies in the metaverse. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges in behavioral mining and the potential regulation of financial activities in the metaverse.

However, some business activities are on different blockchains, which have different consensus algorithms and network architectures, thus limiting the interoperability among these activities and making each blockchain an island. Cross-chain technology can connect different blockchains and realize the interoperability and sharing of information among them. This work designs a cross-chain digital asset system for secure trading and payment. It builds two parallel chains, i.e., digital asset chain (DAC) and payment chain (PC), and their functions are analyzed and designed. The cross-chain, i.e., relay chain (RC), is used to realize cross-chain interoperability, where the cross-chain message format and authority setting are designed to endow parallel chains with the ability to recognize. The decentralized characteristic of the RC allows cross-chain messages to be safely transmitted to ensure secure trading and payment.

Moreover, access must also be assured during health emergency crises such as the recent outbreak, which represents the greatest test of the flexibility and the efficiency of PHR sharing among healthcare providers, which ended up an immense interruption to the healthcare industry. Moreover, the right to privacy is the most fundamental right for a patient. Hence, the patient health records in the healthcare sector have faced issues with privacy breaches, insider outside attacks, and unauthorized access to crucial patients' records. As a result, it pushes more patients to demand more control, security, and a smoother experience when they want to access their health records. Furthermore, the lack of interoperability among the healthcare system and providers and the added weight of cyber-attacks on an already overwhelmed system have called for an immediate solution. In this work, we developed a secured blockchain framework that safeguards patients' full control over their health data which can be stored in their private IPFS and later shared with an authorized provider.

Layer-2 systems, such as side-chains or Rollups, have been proposed as a possible strategy to overcome this limitation. Layer-2 systems interact with the main-chain in two ways. First, users can move funds from/to the main-chain to/from the layer-2. Second, layer-2 systems periodically synchronize with the main-chain to keep some form of log of their activity on the main-chain - this log is key for security. Due to this interaction with the main-chain, which is necessary and recurrent, layer-2 systems impose some load on the main-chain. The impact of such load on the main-chain has been, so far, poorly understood. In addition to that, layer-2 approaches typically sacrifice decentralization and security in favor of higher throughput. This paper presents an experimental study that analyzes the current state of Ethereum layer-2 projects. Our goal is to assess the load they impose on Ethereum and to understand their scalability potential in the long-run. Our analysis shows that the impact of any given layer-2 on the main-chain is the result of both technical aspects (how state is logged on the main-chain) and user behavior (how often users decide to transfer funds between the layer-2 and the main-chain). Based on our observations, we infer that without efficient mechanisms that allow users to transfer funds in a secure and fast manner directly from one layer-2 project to another, current layer-2 systems will not be able to scale Ethereum effectively, regardless of their technical solutions. Furthermore, from our results, we conclude that the layer-2 systems that offer similar security guarantees as Ethereum have limited scalability potential, while approaches that offer better performance, sacrifice security and lead to an increase in centralization which runs against the end-goals of permissionless blockchains.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3237897","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)—Brazil (CAPES); Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia (FCT)(grant numbers:UIDB/50021/2020,2020.05270.BD); Project COSMOS (via the Orçamento de Estado (OE)(grant numbers:PTDC/EEI-COM/29271/2017); “Programa Operacional Regional de Lisboa na sua componente Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento Regional (FEDER)”(grant numbers:Lisboa-01-0145-FEDER-029271); Meta Platforms for the project key Transparency at Scale(grant numbers:LISBOA-01-0145-FEDER-031456); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10018958","Distributed ledgers;blockchain;layer-2;Ethereum","Security;Throughput;Smart contracts;Consensus protocol;Bitcoin;Scalability;Distributed ledger;Ethereum;Blockchains","blockchains","Ethereum layer-2 projects;permissionless blockchains","","","","30","CCBY","18 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

But existing OPE schemes are constrained by limited use cases and inherent performance limitations that make them difficult to be adopted by permissioned blockchain where performance is a major concern. In this paper, we present BlockOPE, an efficient OPE scheme designed around the first study integrating OPE into blockchain systems. By supporting parallel processing with a conflict-reducing design, we argue that BlockOPE is feasible for permissioned blockchain, achieving orders-of-magnitude performance improvement while preserving the ideal OPE security.

Attribute-based access control (ABAC) model is a potential candidate for data sharing cross data centers. But it still faces some challenges, such as different attribute semantics among data centers, and slow query speed of attributes and policies. This paper proposes an architecture for access control across data centers by constructing a global attribute set (GAS) on the blockchain to manage attributes and policies. To achieve a high efficiency, the scheme utilizes world state rather than block for query of data attributes and policies, and employs trust degree to pre authorization.

Compared with conventional peer-to-peer trading without network constraints, NCP2P trading encounters challenges in protecting bidirectional privacy of both the prosumers and the grid operator when implementing market clearing and dispute resolution mechanisms. To deal with them, we apply a novel cryptographic technology called secure multiparty computation (SMPC). Firstly, a secure quadratic programming (QP) algorithm based on SMPC is designed to compute the NCP2P market clearing results with bidirectional privacy. Secondly, we propose dispute resolution mechanisms that employ blockchain to verify the correctness of claimed trading results of the two trading prosumers, and reconstruct the true trading bill based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions using SMPC when both prosumers claim wrong trading results. Finally, we design a bidirectional privacy-preserving NCP2P energy trading framework based on SMPC and blockchain. The case analysis shows that our proposed trading framework using the secure QP algorithm achieves optimal trading results, bidirectional privacy and low communication requirements for prosumers. The accuracy of the proposed dispute resolution mechanisms is also proven.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2023.3263242","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U2066201); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10089177","blockchain;network constraints;peer-to-peer energy trading;privacy;secure multiparty computation","Privacy;Blockchains;Energy resolution;Peer-to-peer computing;Load flow;Costs;Smart contracts","","","","","","","IEEE","30 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, AI behaviors need to be supervised for ex post forensics in case of dispute and accountability. This motivates us to envision a model to record the AI behaviors in intelligent blockchain. In this paper, we propose such a model called AI-Tracer, which leverages proxy re-encryption based on Schnorr signature as well as InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to be integrated into intelligent blockchain. AI-Tracer generates AI-digest during the AI learning process and encrypts it with proxy re-encryption. IPFS is responsible to store the encrypted AI-digest and returns a hash pointer related to AI-digest for further verification. The authorized user can verify the validity of AI-digest by leveraging advanced features of blockchain technology and only the valid AI-digest can be uploaded to intelligent blockchain, which implements trusted tracking for AI behaviors. AI-Tracer achieves fine-grained access control of AI-digest via proxy re-encryption. A user can retrieve the plaintext of AI-digest from intelligent blockchain with the specific authorization.

The world is migrating towards the digitization of vaccination documentation. Still, the current digital vaccination is a centralized model, lacking a universal acceptance. A Universally Acceptable and Ideal Vaccination System (UAIVS) should possess (a) a standard vaccination certificate verification algorithm, (b) privacy to personal information, (c) scalability, (d) support for all vaccinations, (e) accountability for vaccination information access, and (f) a scope for scientific research and development. Blockchain technology intruduces decentralization, immutability, accountability, persistence, and liveliness. These properties make blockchain an ideal candidate to solve the existing problems in digital vaccination. In this paper, we propose a novel block-chain-based system, namely BlockVac, to implement a UAIVS. Furthermore, our work provides a way to track an individual's and family's vaccination history, which is essential for scientific research and development. BlockVac is highly modular, sealable, and cost-efficient, providing enough room for future feature additions. The current works lack cost and scalability analysis. We show the scalability of our system through a thorough analysis. Our implementation shows that adding one vaccination record costs $7.16828\times 10^{-6}$ ETH $(\sim 0.026\text{USD})$ for registration, $2.5089\times 10^{-5}$ ETH $(\sim 0.078\text{USD})$ for vaccination, and the system can easily handle up to 20K vaccinations per hour.","","978-1-6654-6104-7","10.1109/Blockchain55522.2022.00051","MeitY; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9881614","Blockchain;Ethereum;Smart Contracts;Public Accountability;Scalability","Privacy;Costs;Scalability;Documentation;Vaccines;Blockchains;History","blockchains;data privacy;diseases;health care;medical administrative data processing;medical information systems","universal acceptance;standard vaccination certificate verification algorithm;vaccination information access;scientific research;BlockVac;vaccination record costs;vaccines;vaccination documentation;digital vaccination;block-chain-based system;ideal vaccination system;universally acceptable and ideal vaccination system;UAIVS","","","","31","IEEE","19 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

EHRs are generally shared among healthcare stakeholders, and thus are susceptible to power failures, data misuse, a lack of privacy, security, and an audit trail, among other problems. Blockchain, on the other hand, is a groundbreaking technology that provides a distributed and decentralized environment in which nodes in a list of networks can connect to each other without the need for a central authority. It has the potential to overcome the limits of EHR management and create a more secure, decentralized, and safer environment for exchanging EHR data. Further, blockchain is a distributed ledger on which data can be stored and shared in a cryptographically secure, validated, and mutually agreed-upon manner across all mining nodes. The blockchain stores data with a high level of integrity and robustness, and it cannot be altered. When smart contracts are used to make decisions and conduct analytics with machine-learning algorithms, the results may be trusted and unquestioned. However, Blockchain is not always indestructible and suffers from scalability and complexity issues that might render it inefficient. Combining AI and blockchain technology can handled some of the drawbacks of these two technical ecosystems effectively. AI algorithms rely on data or information to learn, analyze, and reach conclusions. The performance of AI algorithms is enhanced through the data obtained from a data repository or a reliable, secure, trustworthy, and credible platform. Researchers have identified three categories of blockchain-based potential solutions for the management of electronic health records: conceptual, prototype, and implemented. The purpose of this research work is to conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify and assess research articles that were either conceptual or implemented to manage EHRs using blockchain technology. The study conducts a comprehensive evaluation of the literature on blockchain technology and enhanced health record management systems utilizing artificial intelligence technologies. The study examined 189 research papers collected from various publication categories. The in-depth analysis focuses on the privacy, security, accessibility, and scalability of publications. The SLR has illustrated that blockchain technology has the potential to deliver decentralization, security, and privacy that are frequently lacking in traditional EHRs. Additionally, the outcomes of the extensive analysis inform future researchers about the type of blockchain to use in their research. Additionally, methods used in healthcare are summarized per application area while their pros and cons are highlighted. Finally, the emphasized taxonomy combines blockchain and artificial intelligence, which enables us to analyze possible blockchain and artificial intelligence applications in health records management systems.

In the WSNs, routing is performed using different routing protocols like low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH), heterogeneous gateway-based energy-aware multi-hop routing (HMGEAR), etc. In such protocols, some nodes in the network may perform malicious activities. Therefore, four deep learning (DL) techniques and a real-time message content validation (RMCV) scheme based on blockchain are used in the proposed network for the detection of malicious nodes (MNs). Moreover, to analyse the routing data in the WSN, DL models are trained on a state-of-the-art dataset generated from LEACH, known as WSN-DS 2016. The WSN contains three types of nodes: sensor nodes, cluster heads (CHs) and the base station (BS). The CHs after aggregating the data received from the sensor nodes, send it towards the BS. Furthermore, to overcome the single point of failure issue, a decentralized blockchain is deployed on CHs and BS. Additionally, MNs are removed from the network using RMCV and DL techniques. Moreover, legitimate nodes (LNs) are registered in the blockchain network using proof-of-authority consensus protocol. The protocol outperforms proof-of-work in terms of computational cost. Later, routing is performed between the LNs using different routing protocols and the results are compared with original LEACH and HMGEAR protocols. The results show that the accuracy of GRU is 97%, LSTM is 96%, CNN is 92% and ANN is 90%. Throughput, delay and the death of the first node are computed for LEACH, LEACH with DL, LEACH with RMCV, HMGEAR, HMGEAR with DL and HMGEAR with RMCV.

On the other hand, Blockchain technologies are emerging as promising and cost-effective means to meet some of these requirements due to their inherent design properties, such as secure cryptography and a resilient peer-to-peer network. Likewise, Blockchain-based applications can benefit the healthcare domain via their properties of asset sharing, and audit trails of data access. Existing work mainly pays attention to centralized and blockchain-based mechanisms. But it doesn’t realize the increase need for better data interoperability amount multiple healthcare systems and services. This requires shifting from the application-centric solutions toward the patient-centric solutions. This paper presents A secure and efficient framework based on Blockchain, Cloud, and IoT named Patient-Centric Healthcare Framework (PCH) for better healthcare systems interoperability. A tiered-based architecture (5 tiers) with collaboration is designed for the feasible realization of PCH. Also, the design and implementation aspects start from the layering diagram, system context, and detailed reference architecture that emphasizes the detailed component topology and interactions within the framework.

Centralization of any data is vulnerable to the problem of hacking and single failure in addition to control from one organization. So, the centralization of data is the common problem that all current healthcare systems suffer from. Even in the Metaverse world, the application of Metaverse in healthcare services loses users’ privacy as one of its challenges. In this study, we suggest using blockchain in healthcare to improve security and privacy in medical records.

This paper presents a novel tensor-based receiver for Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted multiple-input multiple-output communications capable of jointly estimating the channels and the transmitted data streams in a semi-blind fashion. Assuming a fully passive IRS architecture and introducing a simple space-time coding scheme at the transmitter, the received signal model can be advantageously built using the PARATUCK tensor model, which can be seen as a hybrid of parallel factor analysis and Tucker models. A semi-blind receiver is derived by exploiting the algebraic structure of the PARATUCK tensor model. We first formulate a semi-blind receiver based on a trilinear alternating least squares method that iteratively estimates the two involved – IRS-base station and user terminal-IRS – communication channels and the transmitted symbol matrix. We discuss identifiability conditions that ensure the joint semi-blind recovery of the involved channel and symbol matrices and propose a joint design of the coding and IRS reflection matrices to optimize the receiver performance. We also formulate an enhanced two-stage semi-blind receiver that efficiently exploits the direct link to refine the channel and symbol estimates iteratively. In particular, we discuss the impact of an imperfect IRS absorption (residual reflection) on the performance of the proposed receiver. Numerical results are proposed for performance evaluation in several system settings in terms of the normalized mean squared error of the estimated channels and the achieved symbol error rate, corroborating the merits of the proposed semi-blind receiver in comparison to competing methods.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2023.3263257","CNPq(grant numbers:312491/2020-4); Digital Futures Project PERCy; Ericsson Research, Sweden; Ericsson Innovation Center(grant numbers:UFC.51); Technical Cooperation Contract Ericsson/UFC; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior - Brasil(grant numbers:001); CAPES/PRINT Proc.(grant numbers:88887.311965/2018-00); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10089189","Intelligent reflecting surface;channel estimation;symbol estimation;MIMO;tensor modeling;PARATUCK;semi-blind receiver","Channel estimation;Receivers;Symbols;Tensors;Matrix decomposition;Estimation;MIMO communication","6G mobile communication;channel estimation;error statistics;iterative methods;matrix algebra;mean square error methods;MIMO communication;radio receivers;radio transmitters;space-time codes;tensors","6th generation wireless systems;fully passive IRS architecture;imperfect IRS absorption;intelligent reflecting surface;IRS base station;IRS-assisted MIMO systems;joint semiblind recovery;multiple-input multiple-output communications;normalized mean squared error;parallel factor analysis;PARATUCK tensor model;received signal model;receiver performance;residual reflection;semi-blind joint channel-symbol estimation;simple space-time coding scheme;smart radio environment concept;symbol error rate;tensor-based receiver;transmitted symbol matrix;trilinear alternating least squares method;two-stage semiblind receiver;user terminal-IRS-communication channels","","","","64","IEEE","30 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Smartphones and the growth of Internet access around the world are two big reasons for this volume. Due to the current state of global health, which is mostly caused by Covid-19, telecommunications companies have a great chance to find new ways to make money by using Big Data Analytics (BDA) solutions. This is because data traffic has gone up. After all, more customers are using telecommunications services. As most of the world's data is now made by smartphones and sent through the telecom network, telecom operators are facing an information explosion that makes it harder to make decisions based on the data they need to predict how people will act. This problem was solved by making a system that sorts through information and makes suggestions based on how people have behaved in the past. Content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and a hybrid approach are the three main ways that recommender systems filter data to solve the problem of too much data and give users relevant recommendations based on their interests and the data that is being created in real-time. Distance algorithms like Cosine, Euclidean, Manhattan, and Minkowski are at the heart of the suggested recommender system, which aims to research and design an effective recommendation strategy. The suggested model suggests different telecom packages to meet the needs of users to increase revenue per subscriber and get consumers, telecom providers, and corporations to sign long-term contracts.","2573-3079","978-1-6654-5401-8","10.1109/PDGC56933.2022.10053201","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10053201","Big Data Analytics;Recommender system;Collaborative filtering;content-based filtering;Hybrid approaches;Cosine;Euclidean;Manhattan;and Minkowski","Wireless networks;Software algorithms;Taxonomy;Filtering algorithms;Big Data;Information filters;Telecommunications","Big Data;collaborative filtering;data analysis;epidemics;Internet;recommender systems;smart phones;telecommunication services","Big Data Analytics solutions;big reasons;collaborative filtering;Covid-19;data traffic;different telecom packages;effective recommendation strategy;global health;great chance;information explosion;Internet access;main ways;smartphones;suggested recommender system;tele-communication industry;telecom network;telecom operators;telecom providers;telecommunications companies;telecommunications services;users relevant recommendations;wireless networks","","","","33","IEEE","1 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consequently, infrastructure providers (InPs) desire virtualized networks to share their subleased resources for effective resource management. Nonetheless, security and privacy challenges in the wireless network deter operators from collaborating with one another for resource trading. Lately, blockchain technology has received overwhelming attention for secure resource trading thanks to its security features. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical framework for blockchain-based resource trading among peer-to-peer (P2P) mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), for autonomous resource slicing in 5G RAN. Specifically, a consortium blockchain network that supports hyperledger smart contract (SC) is deployed to set up secure resource trading among seller and buyer MVNOs. With the aim of designing a fair incentive mechanism, we model the pricing and demand problem of the seller and buyers as a two-stage Stackelberg game, where the seller MVNO is the leader and buyer MVNOs are followers. To achieve a Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) for the formulated game, a dueling deep Q-network (Dueling DQN) scheme is designed to achieve optimal pricing and demand policies for autonomous resource allocation at negotiation interval. Comprehensive simulation results analysis prove that the proposed scheme reduces double spending attacks by 12% in resource trading settings, and maximizes the utilities of players. The proposed scheme also outperforms deep Q-Network (DQN), Q-learning (QL) and greedy algorithm (GA), in terms of slice and system level satisfaction and resource utilization.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2021.3124046","National Natural Science Research Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771098); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:ZYGX2018J068); Intelligent Terminal Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province(grant numbers:SCITLAB-200025); Department of Science and Technology of Sichuan Province(grant numbers:2020YFQ0025); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9594082","Blockchain;deep reinforcement learning;network slicing;resource trading;stackelberg game;5G","Blockchains;Resource management;5G mobile communication;Games;Dynamic scheduling;Security;Pricing","5G mobile communication;blockchains;deep learning (artificial intelligence);game theory;mobile computing;optimisation;peer-to-peer computing;pricing;radio access networks;reinforcement learning;resource allocation;virtualisation","blockchain-enabled resource trading;deep reinforcement learning-based autonomous RAN slicing;radio access network slicing;virtualized networks;infrastructure providers;subleased resources;resource management;wireless network;blockchain technology;security features;blockchain-based resource trading;peer-to-peer mobile virtual network operators;autonomous resource slicing;5G RAN;consortium blockchain network;hyperledger smart contract;two-stage Stackelberg game;seller MVNO;dueling deep Q-network scheme;autonomous resource allocation;resource trading settings;system level satisfaction;resource utilization;buyer MVNO;secure resource trading;P2P MVNO;Stackelberg equilibrium;dueling DQN scheme;optimal pricing policies;demand policies","","12","","35","IEEE","29 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The softwarized UAV enable ubiquitous connection, as well as a flexible, cost-effective, and improved method for upgrading all network services without shutting down the entire system. However, the connectivity of UAVs with OpenFlow switches and their heavy reliance on unsecured communication protocols makes the entire network vulnerable. This is a critical concern, particularly in combat surveillance, where eavesdropping, adding, changing, or deleting messages during communications between deployed UAVs and SDN controller is a possible threat. To mitigate the aforementioned issues, this paper presents a novel secure data sharing framework for softwarized UAV environments that incorporates blockchain and Deep Learning (DL).

The microgrids generate electricity for self-use and sell surplus energy locally in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) manner, where seller and buyer meet to trade electricity directly on agreed terms without any intermediary. The energy trading decision for the microgrid is a challenging issue due to uncertainty of renewable energy yield, the electric demands of EVs and without knowing the offers of other competitive microgrids together makes it hard to decide the selling price of energy per unit. Further, there is a need to audit and verify the energy trading and store energy transactions securely in distributed manner to avoid collapse of the system in case of single point of failure. In this context, this paper presents a Blockchain and Quantum Reinforcement Learning based optimized Energy Trading (BQL-ET) model for E-mobility. Firstly, a double-auction mechanism is proposed to set optimal market-trading price by observing the selling price of each microgrid and the demand of EV's. Secondly, using smart contracts, consortium blockchain is deployed for the evaluation of overall utility, which includes energy supply, demand, and cost for both microgrids and EVs. Finally, Utility maximization problem is transformed into a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and in order to develop the learning policy and maximize overall utility, a QRL optimization for solving the MDP problem is proposed. Convergence analysis and performance results attest that BQL-ET convergences faster, maximizes the utility of both microgrids an EVs with lower transaction confirmation time and setting of the optimal market-trading price compared to state-of-the art models.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2022.3225524","Galgotias University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10039707","Blockchain;electric vehicles;energy trading;microgrids;quantum reinforcement learning","Microgrids;Blockchains;Security;Convergence;Privacy;Costs;Uncertainty","blockchains;contracts;cryptocurrencies;decision making;distributed power generation;electric vehicle charging;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;optimisation;peer-to-peer computing;power engineering computing;power markets;pricing;reinforcement learning","Blockchain;competitive microgrids;E-mobility;electric demands;Electric mobility;Electric Vehicles;electricity;energy supply;energy trading decision;microgrid;optimal market-trading price;optimized Energy Trading model;Peer-to-Peer manner;Quantum Reinforcement Learning;renewable energy yield;selling price;store energy transactions;surplus energy","","","","39","IEEE","7 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One key challenge in developing CAVs is the design of an autonomous controller that can accurately execute near real-time control decisions, such as a quick acceleration when merging to a highway and frequent speed changes in a stop-and-go traffic. However, the use of conventional feedback controllers or traditional learning-based controllers, solely trained by each CAV’s local data, cannot guarantee a robust controller performance over a wide range of road conditions and traffic dynamics. In this paper, a new federated learning (FL) framework enabled by large-scale wireless connectivity is proposed for designing the autonomous controller of CAVs. In this framework, the learning models used by the controllers are collaboratively trained among a group of CAVs. To capture the varying CAV participation in the FL training process and the diverse local data quality among CAVs, a novel dynamic federated proximal (DFP) algorithm is proposed that accounts for the mobility of CAVs, the wireless fading channels, as well as the unbalanced and non-independent and identically distributed data across CAVs. A rigorous convergence analysis is performed for the proposed algorithm to identify how fast the CAVs converge to using the optimal autonomous controller. In particular, the impacts of varying CAV participation in the FL process and diverse CAV data quality on the convergence of the proposed DFP algorithm are explicitly analyzed. Leveraging this analysis, an incentive mechanism based on contract theory is designed to improve the FL convergence speed. Simulation results using real vehicular data traces show that the proposed DFP-based controller can accurately track the target CAV speed over time and under different traffic scenarios. Moreover, the results show that the proposed DFP algorithm has a much faster convergence compared to popular FL algorithms such as federated averaging (FedAvg) and federated proximal (FedProx). The results also validate the feasibility of the contract-theoretic incentive mechanism and show that the proposed mechanism can improve the convergence speed of the DFP algorithm by 40% compared to the baselines.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2022.3183996","Office of Naval Research (ONR)(grant numbers:MURI Grant N00014-19-1-2621); U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1739642,CNS-1941348); Academy of Finland Project CARMA; Academy of Finland Project MISSION; Academy of Finland Project SMARTER; INFOTECH Project NOOR; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9806308","Wireless networks;machine learning;control systems","Heuristic algorithms;Data integrity;Convergence;Road traffic;Wireless networks;Vehicle dynamics;Servers;Control systems;Machine learning","control system synthesis;convergence;fading channels;feedback;incentive schemes;intelligent transportation systems;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile radio;mobile robots;optimisation;road traffic;road vehicles;wireless sensor networks","CAVs local data;connected and autonomous vehicles;DFP algorithm;DFP-based controller;diverse CAV data quality;dynamic federated proximal algorithm;federated learning framework;feedback controllers;intelligent transportation systems;learning-based controllers;optimal autonomous controller;real-time control decisions;rigorous convergence analysis;road autonomous controller design;robust controller performance;varying CAV participation;wireless fading channels","","5","","38","IEEE","24 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The traditional MCS relies on the centralized server for task handle is susceptible to a single point of failure. Targeting this security issue, researchers have proposed a series of blockchain-based MCS. However, nodes in the blockchain suffer from high computation cost for data processing. Simultaneously, most blockchain-based MCS systems lack an efficient incentive mechanism for service requesters and workers. In this work, we integrate the smart contract and mobile devices to establish a secure, interactive, and fair blockchain-based MCS system called BSIF. To prevent illegitimate participants, BSIF requests all users to verify their identities using private keys from the registration phase. In the case of worker location privacy leakage, the location-based symmetric key generator is adopted to coordinate a session key for target range worker selection. Besides, we transfer the data evaluation process to the requester side (e.g., a personal computer), reducing computation cost in the blockchain nodes.

Specifically, we are interested in situations, where fairness among the agents contributing to the platform is needed. A notable example is the platforms operated by public bodies, where fairness is a legal requirement. The design of such distributed systems is challenging due to the fact that we wish to simultaneously realize an efficient social sensing platform but also deliver a predefined quality of service to the agents (for example, a fair opportunity to contribute to the platform). In this article, we introduce iterated function systems (IFSs) as a tool for the design and analysis of systems of this kind. We show how the IFS framework can be used to realize systems that deliver a predictable quality of service to agents, can be used to underpin contracts governing the interaction of agents with the social sensing platform, and which are efficient. To illustrate our design via a use case, we consider a large, high-density network of participating parked vehicles. When awoken by an administrative center, this network proceeds to search for moving missing entities of interest using RFID-based techniques. We regulate which vehicles are actively searching for the moving entity of interest at any point in time. In doing so, we seek to equalize vehicular energy consumption across the network. This is illustrated through simulations of a search for a missing Alzheimer’s patient in Melbourne, Australia.

Therefore, the detection and quantification of account risk are of great importance for both cryptocurrency investors and blockchain security researchers. In this article, we propose the first general framework for account risk rating on Ethereum, which includes a devisable suspiciousness metric to adapt to various illicit fraud detection and a network propagation mechanism to formulate the relations between accounts and transactions. By conducting extensive experiments on a real-world dataset from Ethereum, we show the universality of the account risk rating framework. Particularly, statistical analyses on different risk levels of accounts demonstrate that the risk rating framework has access to detect various illicit accounts. And the metric analysis of risk rating results put forward some insights.

In the system, we designed a new algorithm in which blockchain-assisted compressed algorithm of federated learning is applied for content caching, called CREAT to predict cached files. In the CREAT algorithm, each edge node uses local data to train a model and then uses the model to learn the features of users and files, so as to predict popular files to improve the cache hit rate. In order to ensure the security of edge nodes’ data, we use federated learning (FL) to enable multiple edge nodes to cooperate in training without sharing data. In addition, for the purpose of reducing communication load in FL, we will compress gradients uploaded by edge nodes to reduce the time required for communication. What is more, in order to ensure the security of the data transmitted in the CREAT algorithm, we have incorporated blockchain technology in the algorithm.

First, a two-layered architecture is proposed that consists of two types of blockchains: local model update chain (LMUC) assisted by device-to-device (D2D) communication and global model update chain (GMUC) supporting task sharding. The D2D-assisted LMUC is designed to chronologically and efficiently record all of the local model training results, which can help to form long-term reputations of local devices. The GMUC is proposed to provide both security and efficiency by preventing mobile edge computing nodes from malfunctioning and dividing them into logically isolated FL task-specific chains. Then a reputation-learning-based incentive mechanism is introduced to make participating local devices more trustful with a reward implemented by a smart contract. Finally, a case study is given to show that the proposed framework performs well in terms of FL learning accuracy and blockchain time delay.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.011.2000339","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFE0205502); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9318246","","Blockchains;Computational modeling;Task analysis;Data models;Computer architecture;Security;Training data;Collaborative work","cellular radio;data privacy;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;network theory (graphs);peer-to-peer computing","GMUC;LMUC;local model training results;local devices;security;logically isolated FL task-specific chains;reputation-learning-based incentive mechanism;FL learning accuracy;layered blockchain architecture;federated learning;mobile edge network;privacy-preserving;artificial intelligence;raw training data;leveraging blockchain;trust issues;local model update chain","","11","","15","IEEE","8 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

To address this issue, we propose an anonymous reputation management system based on the dual blockchain architecture, where reputation scores are masked. More precisely, one chain is used to store and update reputation scores, and another chain is responsible for publishing tasks and storing task-related data. To anonymously update and verify the reputation scores without affecting their usages in data sensing process, a kind of ring signature and Pedersen commitment is employed in smart contracts. In addition, a Schnorr signature is generated to make the reputation scores verifiable in the MCS system.

Fortunately, techniques such as Machine Learning (ML) allow the creation of selection models without human interaction by identifying the BC features that match the requirements provided by the user in an automated and flexible manner. Thus, this work presents the design and implementation of an ML-based BC selection approach that employs five ML models to select the most suitable BC given user requirements (e.g., BC popularity, fast block inclusion, or Smart Contract - SC support).

As always assumed in theoretical studies, to expand service capability, it is desirable to integrate edge resources into a unified resource pool and make different edge facilities collaborate. However, this collaboration is difficult in practice since the heterogeneity among paradigms leads to resource isolation. This article focuses on clarifying and shielding heterogeneity among edge computing paradigms for collaboration. First, based on cloudlet, mobile edge computing and fog computing, three main edge computing paradigms, i.e., small cloudy edge paradigm (SmallC), mobile integrated edge paradigm (MobInt) and front ad hoc edge paradigm (FrontAH), are defined. So that the heterogeneity among them can be analyzed, according to which, collaboration challenges in computing resource trading, information communication and resource sharing are identified. Promising techniques such as blockchain-based smart contract, media-independent handover (MIH), and software-defined network and network function virtualization (SDN/NFV) are then introduced and integrated into a complete collaboration solution. Finally, taking the unmanned vehicular navigation as an example, the performance of collaboration is evaluated, considering additional costs introduced by collaborations, including trading, network handoff and data transmission among edge facilities in different paradigms. Simulation results show that compared with existing schemes of the three paradigms, the collaboration can reduce the cost (i.e. weighted sum of energy consumption and delay) by at least 45.6%.","1558-0687","","10.1109/MWC.014.2200283","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10091816","","Cloud computing;Delays;Collaboration;Edge computing;Uplink;Energy consumption;Task analysis","","","","","","","IEEE","3 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Consequently, it is natural that IoT becomes the driving force to meet the increasing demand for frictionless transactions. To secure transactions in IoT, blockchain is widely deployed since it can remove the necessity of a trusted central authority. However, the mainstream blockchain-based IoT payment platforms, dominated by Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithms, face several major security and scalability challenges that result in system failures and financial loss. Among the three leading attacks in this scenario, double-spend attacks and long-range attacks threaten the tokens of blockchain users, while eclipse attacks target Denial of Service. To defeat these attacks, a novel bidirectional-linked blockchain (BLB) using chameleon hash functions is proposed, where bidirectional pointers are constructed between blocks. Furthermore, a new committee members auction (CMA) consensus algorithm is designed to improve the security and attack resistance of BLB while guaranteeing high scalability. In CMA, distributed blockchain nodes elect committee members through a verifiable random function. The smart contract uses Shamir’s secret-sharing scheme to distribute the trapdoor keys to committee members. To better investigate BLB’s resistance against double-spend attacks, an improved Nakamoto’s attack analysis is presented. In addition, a modified entropy metric is devised to measure eclipse attack resistance across different consensus algorithms. Extensive evaluation results show the superior resistance against attacks and demonstrate high scalability of BLB compared with current leading paradigms based on PoS and PoW.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3103275","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9509292","Bidirectional blockchain;double-spend attack;eclipse attack;Internet of Things (IoT);long-range attack;scalability","Blockchains;Scalability;Consensus algorithm;Cryptography;Resistance;Internet of Things;Hash functions","blockchains;data privacy;electronic commerce;entropy;Internet of Things","IoT devices;Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm;long-range attacks;BLB;bidirectional pointers;distributed blockchain nodes;blockchain-based IoT payment platforms;Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm;double-spend attacks;bidirectional-linked blockchain;chameleon hash functions;committee members auction consensus;Nakamoto attack analysis;Internet of Things;CMA consensus;entropy metric;eclipse attack resistance","","17","","42","IEEE","9 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our system aims at tackling these issues using a decentralized system to store the patient's record. The patient and the doctor/healthcare institutions use a Decentralized Application as an interface to the Blockchain network. When a patient visits the doctor, the patient can give access to his/her medical data through this Decentralized Application via an Ethereum smart contract. Once the patient gives access, the doctor can access all the patient's medical records and history in one unified interface. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are used to give a tailored medical experience to the patients. With rich data that is available from the users' network, can be fed into the Machine Learning models to do various levels of analysis to give patients and doctors further insight into the medical records.","","978-1-6654-8407-7","10.1109/CONIT55038.2022.9847762","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9847762","Decentralized Application (DAPP);Artificial Intelligence (AI);Machine Learning (ML);InterPlanetary File System (IPFS);Electronic Health Record (EHR);Application Program Interface (API);Proof Of Work (PoW);Artificial Neural Network (ANN);Support Vector Machine (SVM);Natural language processing (NLP);Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)","Training;Support vector machines;Medical services;Machine learning;Predictive models;Decentralized applications;Data models","blockchains;electronic health records;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing","healthcare environment;patient records;multiple centralized systems;healthcare institutions;complete data history;medical data history;decentralized application;artificial intelligence;medical records;intelligence health record system","","","","10","IEEE","18 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, adversaries crave the identity of the data provider/user, damage the evidence, violate evidence jurisdiction, and leak evidence. Therefore, protecting privacy and evidence accountability while guaranteeing access control and traceability in VDF is no easy task. To address the above-mentioned issues, we propose Eunomia: an anonymous and secure VDF scheme based on blockchain. It preserves privacy with decentralized anonymous credentials without trusted third parties. Vehicular data and evidence are uploaded by data providers to the blockchain and stored in distributed data storage. Each investigation is modeled as a finite state machine with state transitions being executed by smart contracts. Eunomia achieves fine-grained evidence access control via ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption and Bulletproofs. A user must hold specific attributes and a temporary-and-unexpired token/warrant to retrieve data from the blockchain. Finally, a secret key is embedded into data to trace the traitor if any evidence breach happens. We use a formal analysis to demonstrate the strong privacy and security properties of Eunomia.

To guarantee the integrity of the outsourced data, provable data possession (PDP) schemes for multi-copy data and multi-cloud have been proposed respectively. To avoid a single point of failure and to increase the security of the outsourced data, many users store multiple copies on multiple cloud servers. However, few protocols support multi-copy data and multi-cloud at the same time. Considering that three entities (third-party auditor, cloud organizer and cloud storage servers) participate in the auditing process, it is difficult for users to locate the position of the faults, including entity position, file position and data block corruption position, when the auditor reports data corruption. In this paper we propose a certificateless multi-copy public auditing protocol in multi-cloud storage, which supports to locate the faults entities and corrupted data blocks. Specifically, instead of relying on a trusted centralized judgement entity to deal with the faults detection, smart contracts combined with the binary search technique are utilized to help achieve the reliability of faults localization result and the accuracy of the judgement. Additionally, the proposed protocol supports data dynamics update, including data modification, insertion and deletion.

In this article, we propose a novel blockchain-based human-to-infrastructure contact tracing framework for the post-pandemic era. Specifically, our approach collects and records the interaction information between persons and predeployed anchor nodes to trace the possible contacts with confirmed patients, so as to capture the indirect contacts and reduces the energy consumption of users. To address the privacy leakage and reliability issues in contact tracing, we introduce a self-sovereign identity (SSI) model-based blockchain which enables users to gain full control of their own identities and eliminate the linkage between the identity and location information in interaction records. To further preserve the privacy of confirmed patients, we introduce the private set intersection cardinality (PSI-CA) protocol to estimate the risk of infection by only counting the number of encounters between users and confirmed patients. Two self-executed smart contracts are deployed on the SSI blockchain to perform contact tracing, which guarantees the robustness of the system. The performance analysis validates the effectiveness of our approach.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3138971","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772385); U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:IIS-1722791); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9663561","Blockchain;COVID-19;digital contact tracing;privacy-preserving;self-sovereign identity (SSI) model","Privacy;Bluetooth;Blockchains;COVID-19;Protocols;Servers;Global Positioning System","blockchains;data privacy;diseases;epidemics;medical information systems;protocols","self-sovereign identity model-based blockchain;location information;post-pandemic era;personal precautions;COVID-19 variants;human-to-human digital contact tracing systems;interaction information;possible contacts;indirect contacts;energy consumption;privacy leakage;private set intersection cardinality protocol;PSI-CA protocol;SSI model-based blockchain;blockchain-based human-to-infrastructure contact tracing framework","","1","","32","IEEE","28 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, “Right to be Forgotten” has been imposed in new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of European Union, which is incompatible with blockchain's immutability. Therefore, it is imperative to design efficient redactable blockchain in a controlled way. In this paper, we present a generic design of redactable blockchain protocols in the permissionless setting, applied to both proof-of-stake and proof-of-work blockchains. Our protocol can (1) maintain the same adversary bound requirement as the underlying blockchain, (2) support various network environments, (3) offer public verifiability for any redaction, and (4) achieve instant redaction, even only within one slot in the best case, which is desirable for redacting harmful data. Furthermore, we define the first ideal protocol of redactable blockchain and conduct security analysis following the language of universal composition. Finally, we develop a proof-of-concept implementation showing that the overhead remains minimal for both online and re-spawning nodes, which demonstrates the high efficiency of our design.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2022.3212601","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1005801); Innovation Technology Fund(grant numbers:ITS/224/20FP); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62172396); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62102404); Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFB2701600); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9913698","Blockchain;proof-of-stake;proof-of-work;redactable blockchain","Blockchains;Protocols;Bitcoin;Internet;Proposals;Peer-to-peer computing;Technological innovation","","","","","","","IEEE","10 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Anonymous credentials (AC) address this by providing the user with a credential issued by a trusted entity that convinces the service provider ( $\mathcal {SP}$ ) that the user is authenticated but reveals no other information. The existing AC schemes assume a single trusted authority (certifier) that validates all the user attributes. In practice, however, a user may require different attributes to be attested by different certifiers. This means that the user has to get multiple credentials, increasing the burden on the  $\mathcal {SP}$  who has to verify each one of them. Moreover, complete anonymity can be misused. We propose a decentralized threshold revocable anonymous credential (DTRAC) scheme over blockchains that supports – a) attestation of attributes by multiple certifiers, and b) anonymity revocation through a set of distributed openers, by integrating threshold opening to the state-of-the-art threshold anonymous credential issuance scheme, Coconut [35]. DTRAC generates a single credential on attributes that are attested by multiple certifiers, freeing the SP from the hassle of verifying multiple credentials. We analyze the security of DTRAC formally in the universal composability (UC) framework. We also implement a prototype on Ethereum using smart contracts and give a detailed analysis of its performance. We compare the verification time for credentials with attributes attested by multiple certifiers in both DTRAC and Coconut and see that in terms of execution time and gas consumption, DTRAC performs significantly better than Coconut. It also scales better, with the performance gain of DTRAC over Coconut increasing linearly with the number of certifiers.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3225439","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9965378","Zero-knowledge proofs;threshold issuance of credentials;threshold opening of credentials;multi-certifier model","Elliptic curves;Blockchains;Computer science;Authentication;Prototypes;Performance gain;Companies","authorisation;blockchains;data privacy;Internet;trusted computing","AC schemes;anonymous credentials address;blockchains;Coconut;complete anonymity;decentralized threshold revocable anonymous credential scheme;different certifiers;distributed openers;DTRAC;integrating threshold;multicertifier communication model;multiple certifiers;service provider;single credential;single trusted authority;state-of-the-art threshold anonymous credential issuance scheme;threshold issuance;trusted entity;verifying multiple credentials","","","","40","CCBY","28 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The significant variety of slice resource utilization levels across slice tenants (i. e., Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs)) challenges MEC resource management in NS with MEC, leading to virtual machine resource (VMR) (i. e., computing resource) wastage or scarcity. As a result, for efficient MEC resource management, the infrastructure provider (InP) encourages dynamic resource sharing and trading (DRST) of unutilized slice VMR quotas. Nevertheless, cellular network security and privacy issues deter MVNOs from collaborating on effective DRST. The security characteristics inherent in blockchain have recently gained much interest for secure resource trading. Thus, this paper proposes a unique hierarchical blockchain-based inter-slice computing resource trading (ISCRT) scheme for peer-to-peer (P2P) MVNOs in an autonomous multi-sliced MEC-based 5G network. For secure ISCRT transactions, a consortium blockchain network with hyperledger smart contracts (SC) is designed. We model the demand and pricing problems of buyer and seller MVNOs for the unutilized VMRs using a two-stage Stackelberg game. Then, to obtain the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE), an enhanced dueling double deep Q-network (D3QN) algorithm is proposed, which intelligently determines the optimal demand and pricing policies of MVNOs for the unutilized VMRs during ISCRT transactions at negotiation intervals. Simulation analysis shows that the proposed enhanced D3QN algorithm outperforms benchmark schemes in terms of the MVNO slice-level satisfaction and VMR utilization while reducing double-spending attacks in ISCRT settings by 16% and increasing both players’ utility.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2023.3240301","Department of Science and Technology of Sichuan Province(grant numbers:2020YFQ0025,DZKJDX2021020005); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771098,61806040); Intelligent Terminal Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province(grant numbers:SCITLAB-1018,SCITLAB-20019); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10026871","blockchain;resource trading;deep reinforcement learning;Stackelberg game;MEC;network slicing;5G","Resource management;Blockchains;5G mobile communication;Games;Quality of service;Dynamic scheduling;Security","","","","","","","IEEE","27 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Nevertheless, how to protect highly sensitive UAV data in such a honest-but-curious, open and distributed environment with resource-limited UAVs is a significant challenge. Although our previous work (PATLDAC) in SPNCE’21 devises a cloud-based UAV data access control scheme with policy privacy protection, limited access time and user traceability, it incurs inflexible and centralized cloud data storage and access as well as untrustworthy metadata in untrusted cloud environment for data access and user tracing. To this end, we further propose a blockchain-based privacy-aware data access control (BPADAC) scheme for distributed and secure UAV data sharing in cloud-based IoD. Based on fine-grained, traceable and privacy-preserving UAV data access characteristic of our previous work, we extend it by leveraging blockchain and Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for distributed and trustful UAV data access and storage, together with reliable and limited access mechanism to guarantee cloud UAV data sharing service provision.
