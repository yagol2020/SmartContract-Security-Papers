However, in situations where the flow of information is variable and there are time, quality, and/or cost constraints imposed, smart contracts do not usually offer enough performance. In this article, we describe an elasticity framework that enables dynamic adaptation of smart contracts with respect to used resources, analytics quality, and incurred costs in a transparent manner for both smart contract developers and users. We validate our framework in an Internet of Things and Smart City scenario where several analytics are computed using Elastic Smart Contracts that dynamically adapt the appropriate elasticity variables.","","978-1-6654-0058-9","10.1109/SMDS53860.2021.00039","Junta de Andalucía; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9592437","","Costs;Smart cities;Conferences;Smart contracts;Elasticity;Dynamic scheduling;Blockchains","contracts;Internet of Things","elasticity framework;smart contract developers;smart city scenario;elastic smart contracts;application scenarios;automatic analysis;complex transactions;Internet of Things","","","","16","IEEE","3 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Given their nature, however, program flaws may lead to dramatic financial losses and can be hard to fix. This motivates the need for formal methods that can provide smart contract developers with correctness and security guarantees, ideally automating the verification task. This tutorial introduces the semantic foundations of smart contracts and reviews the state-of-the-art in the field, focusing in particular on the automated, sound, static analysis of Ethereum smart contracts.

The rising interest in the development of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) shows that blockchain technology has the potential to reform business and society. A DAO is an organization wherein business rules are encoded in smart-contract programs that are executed when specified rules are met. The contractual- and business semantics are sine qua non for drafting a legally-binding smart contract in DAO collaborations. Several smart-contract languages (SCLs) exist, such as SPESC, or Symboleo to specify a legally-binding contract. However, their primary focus is on designing and developing smart contracts with the cooperation of IT- and non-IT users. Therefore, this paper fills a gap in the state of the art by specifying a smart-legal-contract markup language (SLCML) for legal- and business constructs to draft a legally-binding DAO. To achieve the paper objective, we first present a formal SCL ontology to describe the legal- and business semantics of a DAO. Secondly, we translate the SCL ontology into SLCML, for which we present the XML schema definition. We demonstrate and evaluate our SLCML language through the specification of a real life-inspired Sale-of-Goods contract.

Indeed, smart contract developers often integrate code portions from other smart contracts in their artifacts. To help developers and researchers more easily estimating and monitoring the code readability of smart contracts, in this demo, we present iSCREAM. iSCREAM automatically inspects Solidity smart contracts and computes a set of metrics that previous research demonstrated being related to code readability.

Suffering from limited architectural support in terms of programming interfaces, state-of-the-art solutions can hardly reach general developers. In this paper, we proposed the CLOAK framework for developing confidential smart contracts. The key capability of Cloak is allowing developers to implement and deploy practical solutions to multi-party transaction (MPT) problems, i.e., transact with secret inputs and states owned by different parties by simply specifying it. To this end, CLOAK introduced a domain-specific annotation language for declaring privacy specifications and further automatically generating confidential smart contracts to be deployed with trusted execution environment (TEE) on blockchain. In our evaluation on both simple and real-world applications, developers managed to deploy business services on blockchain in a concise manner by only developing CLOAK smart contracts whose size is less than 30% of the deployed ones.","2575-8411","978-1-6654-4513-9","10.1109/ICDCS51616.2021.00111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9546461","Blockchain;Smart contract privacy;Trusted execution environment","Privacy;Annotations;Conferences;Smart contracts;Supply chains;Finance;Programming","blockchains;contracts;data protection;formal specification;specification languages;transaction processing;trusted computing;user interfaces","confidential smart contracts;multiparty transaction problems;secret inputs;domain-specific annotation language;privacy specifications;privacy protection;confidential blockchain smart contract development;smart contract confidentiality;CLOAK smart contract development;trusted execution environment;TEE;programming interfaces","","2","","10","IEEE","4 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the rise in cryptocurrency transactions, the need for smart contracts has also increased. Smart contracts, in a nutshell, are digitally executed contracts wherein some parties execute a common goal. The main problem with most of the current smart contracts is that there is no privacy for a party's input to the contract from either the blockchain or the other parties. Our research builds on the Hawk project that provides transaction privacy along with support for smart contracts. However, Hawk relies on a special trusted party known as a manager, which must be trusted not to leak each party's input to the smart contract. In this paper, we present a practical private smart contract protocol that replaces the manager with an MPC protocol such that the function to be executed by the MPC protocol is relatively lightweight, involving little overhead added to the smart contract function, and uses practical sigma protocols and homomorphic commitments to prove to the blockchain that the sum of the incoming balances to the smart contract matches the sum of the outgoing balances.

This article, therefore, proposes a distributed and reliable access control framework for smart cities by combining the blockchain smart contract technology and the attribute-based access control (ABAC) model. The framework consists of one policy management contract (PMC) for managing the ABAC policies, one subject attribute management contract (SAMC) for managing the attributes of subjects (i.e., entities accessing resources), one object attribute management contract (OAMC) for managing the attributes of objects (i.e., resources being accessed), and one access control contract (ACC) for performing the access control. To show the feasibility of the proposed framework, we construct a local private Ethereum blockchain system to implement the four smart contracts and also conduct experiments to evaluate the monetary cost as well as to compare the proposed framework with an existing access control list (ACL)-based scheme. The experimental results show that although the proposed scheme consumes more money than the ACL-based scheme at the deployment stage, it introduces less monetary cost during the system running especially for large-scale smart cities.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.3033434","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI (A) under(grant numbers:19H01103); Telecommunications Advancement Foundation; Support Center for Advanced Telecommunications Technology Research Foundation; China NSFC(grant numbers:61972310); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9238038","Attribute-based access control (ABAC);blockchain;smart cities;smart contract","Access control;Blockchain;Smart cities;Smart contracts;Internet of Things;Medical services","authorisation;decision making;smart cities","smart-contract-driven framework;centralized access control schemes;distributed access control framework;reliable access control framework;blockchain smart contract technology;attribute-based access control model;policy management contract;ABAC policies;subject attribute management contract;object attribute management contract;access control contract;local private Ethereum blockchain system;smart contracts;existing access control list-based scheme;ACL-based scheme;large-scale smart cities","","41","","47","IEEE","23 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The distinctive features of SOCRATES are: (1) a collection of composable behaviours that exercise smart contracts in the blockchain; (2) it deploys a society of bots, with the purpose of detecting defects arising from multi-user interactions, which are impossible to reveal when deploying a single bot. Our empirical investigation demonstrates that SOCRATES is able expose both known and previously unknown faults in smart contracts that are actively run in the official Ethereum blockchain. Moreover, we show that a society of multiple bots is more efficient in fault exposure than a single bot alone.","2159-4848","978-1-7281-6836-4","10.1109/ICST49551.2021.00040","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9438545","Smart contracts;Software testing;Ethereum","Software testing;Bot (Internet);Conferences;Smart contracts;Memory;Blockchain;Programming","contracts;formal specification;program testing;systems analysis","single bot;federated society;bots;smart contract testing;smart contracts;distributed persistent data storage;blockchain;specific test capabilities;SOCRATES","","1","","4","IEEE","24 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The financial industry has been influenced by the rapid growth of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Finance is just one field where blockchain technology used for the first time. There are many other Health care, Agriculture, Food industries and many more industries where blockchain technology is being used. The only reason for the for rapid development and trust is decentralization and consensus protocols.With the advent of Blockchain technology, smart contracts came into being and are very popular today, but the question is what and what problems do they have. In this paper the details of the conversation will be done the same. The term smart contract was first used by Nick Szabo in 1997.Smart contract concept, to use a distributed ledger of the Blockchain platform to store contracts. Now smart contracts on Blockchain are like contracts in the real world. The only difference between a traditional contract and a Blockchain-based contract, is that they are completely digital. In fact a smart contract is actually a small computer program stored within a blockchain.Smart contract is a Self-executing and Self verifying block of code(agreements) which is useful for applications involving third party, that can operate independently. This chapter presents the study of smart contracts, how is i evolved. Chapter also discuss about how smart contract is different from the traditional contract from the technical point of view. Development platform are very important to understand to go into depth of the technicality related to Smart contract. paper also explores various Applications and platforms for Smart Contract.","","978-1-6654-3656-4","10.1109/ComPE53109.2021.9752021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9752021","Smart contract;Blockchain;Blockchain 2.O;Ethereum;Solidity;EVM","Performance evaluation;Computer languages;Costs;Distributed ledger;Smart contracts;Food industry;Finance","blockchains;contracts;cryptocurrencies;cryptographic protocols;data privacy;financial data processing","Blockchain 2.0;blockchain technology;smart contract concept;cryptocurrencies;consensus protocols;distributed ledger;self verifying block;self-executing block;blockchain-based contract;financial industry;health care;agriculture;food industries;small computer program","","5","","20","IEEE","12 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A promising solution to overcome this issue is to use Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), however, using models still involves a learning curve and might not be suitable for non-technical users. To tackle this challenge, chatbot or conversational interfaces can be used to assess the non-technical users to specify a smart contract in gradual and interactive manner. In this paper, we propose iContractBot, a chatbot for modeling and developing smart contracts. Moreover, we investigate how to integrate iContractBot with iContractML, a domainspecific modeling language for developing smart contracts, and instantiate intention models from the chatbot. The iContractBot framework provides a domain-specific language (DSL) based on the user intention and performs model-to-text transformation to generate the smart contract code. A smart contract use case is presented to demonstrate how iContractBot can be utilized for creating models and generating the deployment artifacts for smart contracts based on a simple conversation.","","978-1-6654-4468-2","10.1109/BotSE52550.2021.00015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9474392","Chatbot;Smart Contracts;Blockchain;Model-Driven Engineering;Domain Specific Language;Ethereum;Hyperledger Composer","Conferences;Smart contracts;Buildings;Tools;Chatbot;Model driven engineering;Planning","blockchains;chatbots;contracts;formal specification;high level languages;human computer interaction;interactive systems;object-oriented methods;program compilers;specification languages;user interfaces","smart contract code generation;chatbot;smart contract specification;iContractBot;blockchain technology;model driven engineering;conversational interfaces;iContractML;domainspecific modeling language","","5","","13","IEEE","7 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, civilian entities are facing many issues in waste management due to the lack of proper systems for segregating waste materials. This article proposed a unique smart waste management system using Blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) to simplify the waste segregation with the help of smart bins. The proposed system distributes rewards to users for proper disposal of waste into smart bins using smart contracts. We deployed a prototype model on different test networks to compare its real-time performance. From the experimental analysis, we can conclude that the proposed model performs better on the Matic test network than the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Ropsten test networks. Finally, the proposed solution ensures system transparency, traceability, and scalability, as well as eliminating single points of failure (SPoF).","","978-1-7281-8753-2","10.1109/iSES52644.2021.00107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9701057","Blockchain;Waste Management;IoT;Smart Cities;Smart Bin","Waste management;Industries;Waste materials;Smart cities;Scalability;Smart contracts;Prototypes","biodegradable materials;blockchains;contracts;environmental science computing;Internet of Things;smart cities;town and country planning;waste management","binance smart chain;Internet of Things;nonbiodegradable garbage;Blockchain;system transparency;smart contracts;smart bins;waste segregation;waste materials;waste products;smart cities;IoT;smart solid waste management system","","4","","12","IEEE","8 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, to enable the adoption of such applications, it is important that customers trust the service quality provided. This can only be achieved through transparent Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Current resource provisioning systems are too general to handle such variety in applications. Moreover, service agreements are often opaque to customers, which can be an obstacle for 5G adoption for mission-critical services.In this work, we advocate short-term and specialised rather than long-term general service contracts and propose an end-to-end Permissioned Distributed Ledger (PDL) focused architecture; which allows operators to advertise their service contracts on a public portal backed by a PDL. These service contracts with clear Service Level Agreement (SLA) offers are deployed as smart contracts to enable transparent, automatic and immutable SLAs. To justify our choice of using a permissioned ledger instead of permissionless, we evaluated and compared contract execution times on both permissioned (i.e. Quorum and Hyperledger Fabric) and permissionless (i.e. Ropsten testnet) ledgers.","","978-1-6654-3578-9","10.1109/ICBC51069.2021.9461108","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9461108","Distributed Ledger Technology;Smart Contract;Blockchain;5G;Network Services","Distributed ledger;5G mobile communication;Conferences;Smart contracts;Mission critical systems;Surgery;Fabrics","5G mobile communication;contracts;just-in-time;quality of service;telecommunication network management","remote surgery;service quality;mission-critical services;PDL;smart contracts;Service Level Agreement;network connectivity;life-critical applications;contract execution times;resource provisioning systems;specialised short-term general service contracts;Permissioned Distributed Ledger focused architecture;5G;just-in-time resource allocation","","4","","18","IEEE","24 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This achievement is the result of blockchain immutability which guarantees that no party can alter the conditions of an already deployed contract. However, immutability also makes patching or updating contracts impossible even when incorrectness, unfairness, or security flaws are spotted in them. So far, researchers in academia and industry have developed two main methods, data segregation and proxy storage, with six patterns to make deployed contracts upgradable. However, until now, there has been no comprehensive framework that can simultaneously offer upgradability, security resilience, and scalability features. For example, none of the existing solutions have implemented any security mechanism that can resist attacks such as the DAO one. Through extensive analysis and implementation of all these patterns, and taking state-of-the-art attacks on the Ethereum network into consideration, we propose our innovative framework, “Comprehensive-Data-Proxy pattern” which uses data segregation on the top of proxy pattern, that can completely defend against any types of Reentrancy attacks. Additionally, this solution mitigates the scalability issue of the proxy pattern.

To prevent smart contracts from malicious attacks, a thorough test is indispensable and must be finished before deployment because smart contracts cannot be modified after being deployed. Fuzzing is an important testing approach, but most existing smart contract fuzzers can hardly solve the constraints which involve deeply nested conditional statements, resulting in low coverage. To address this problem, we propose Targy, an efficient targeted mutation strategy based on dynamic taint analysis. We obtain the taint flow by dynamic taint propagation, and generate a more accurate mutation strategy for the input parameters of functions to simultaneously satisfy all conditional statements. We implemented Targy on sFuzz with 3.6 thousand smart contracts running on Ethereum. The numbers of covered branches and detected vulnerabilities increase by 6% and 7% respectively, and the average time required for covering a branch is reduced by 11 %.","2693-9177","978-1-6654-5813-9","10.1109/QRS54544.2021.00035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9724805","fuzz testing;dynamic taint analysis;smart contracts;Ethereum","Conferences;Smart contracts;Software quality;Fuzzing;Software reliability;Security;IP networks","blockchains;contracts;program testing","dynamic taint analysis;fuzz testing;smart contract fuzzers;malicious attacks;Targy;Ethereum;sFuzz","","1","","17","IEEE","10 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Data integration problem in healthcare can be overcome by bringing a decentralized system in the hospital organization. This paper focuses on the use of Blockchains in managing medical records for insurance claim. By removing the central administrator, the suggested architecture uses Ethereum smart contracts to create a tamperproof and transparent healthcare system and ensure the integrity of sensitive patient data. Additionally, the smart contract keeps the patient well-informed and governs the communication between all the participants in the network. The proposed approach provides a solution to eliminate fraudulent insurance claims using Machine Learning (ML) with Blockchain.

It can minimize the contract risks, principal-agent dilemmas, and other issues in corporate governance. However, DAOs also face a variety of governance issues, such as internal governance issues and external governance issues caused by the technical attributes of blockchain and smart contracts. DAO is a typical complex system with the characteristics of both social and engineering complexity. It is difficult for existing governance theories to solve governance problems in DAOs. The parallel intelligence theory based on the artificial systems + computational experiments + parallel execution (ACP) method is a suitable research and practical approach to solve management and control problems for complex systems. Therefore, we propose a parallel governance framework for DAO based on the parallel intelligence theory and discuss its key research issues. Finally, we construct a parallel governance system for GnosisDAO, and conduct computational experiments on its voting mechanism. The results show the defects of GnosisDAO governance mechanism and we thus propose further research directions. We consider that parallel governance represents the future trend of DAO research and practice.

On the other hand, a Smart Contract is a contract that is a computer program that also binds multiple parties into given agreements but is a set of a precise rules and is self-enforceable and self-executable. Since almost all legal contracts are ambiguous by nature and are complex to read and understand, we perform a novel study on how we can replace the traditional vague legal contract with the smart contact and the effect of the ambiguity on the smart contract by performing a thorough analysis on SLAs by measuring their ambiguities in various aspects. We take several samples of real SLAs from six different popular broadband vendors. We use four random SLAs to train the machine learning model to classify and then detect ambiguous words in two unseen SLAs which were the SLAs of Ziply Fiber and Century Link. As different people form different interpretations while reading the ambiguous legal contracts, we generate various human interpretations from the machine detected ambiguous words and convert all those generated interpretations into Smart Contracts to perform testing in Ethereum-based Blockchain to identify the most ambiguous as well as accurate interpretation of the SLA. From our analysis and observation, we were able to find out the most ambiguous interpretation of SLAs and we concluded that the SLA of Ziply Fiber was more ambiguous in general compared to the SLA of Century Link. Moreover, our proposed approach to detect ambiguous terms and to translate an ambiguous legal contract to a smart legal contract using a formal language to measure the degree of ambiguity can be extrapolated and replicated to legal contracts from other types of industries as well.","","978-1-6654-1623-8","10.1109/TPSISA52974.2021.00015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9750250","Smart contract;service level agreement;SLA;ambiguity;complexity;smart legal contract;blockchain;ethereum;clauses;interpretations;ambiguity index;machine learning","Industries;Measurement;Privacy;Law;Smart contracts;Machine learning;Security","blockchains;contracts;formal languages;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence)","SLA;smart contract;service level agreement;ambiguous words;ambiguous legal contract;ambiguous interpretation;ambiguous terms;smart legal contract;random SLA;vague legal contract;Ziply Fiber;Century Link;Ethereum-based blockchain;formal language;formal language","","3","","25","IEEE","14 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They suffer from limitation such as- mandatory fees to be paid to the platform for listing and selling items, lack of privacy and control over account, improper transaction security and so on. This paper presents a decentralized application aiming to reduce these drawbacks using Ethereum blockchain. It was implemented using truffle evolvement framework with solidity language. Ethereum smart contracts contain all functions of this application. Client-side application was created through an API called web3.js. Analytical analyses of this application using Kovan test network show least transactional fees reported in literature till date. The application was shown to have average transaction fee of 0.1524472 (eth) with average run time of 3.5 seconds and average gas consumption of 4.6 gwei, these are the best results obtained till date for such system ensuring cost effectiveness and reducing time complexity. The contract making time was less than a second. Comparison with well-known centralized online marketplaces revealed that proposed system was more economical than current centralized online applications in terms of profit margin.","","978-1-6654-9435-9","10.1109/ICCIT54785.2021.9689879","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9689879","Blockchain Technology;Cryptocurrency;Decentralized Marketplace Application;Ethereum;EVM;ECommerce;IPFS;Smart Contract;Solidity","Privacy;Costs;Smart contracts;Process control;Decentralized applications;Blockchains;Security","application program interfaces;blockchains;contracts;electronic commerce;Internet","time complexity;current centralized online applications;decentralized marketplace application;Ethereum smart contract;centralized marketplaces;transaction security;decentralized application;Ethereum blockchain;truffle evolvement framework;solidity language;Kovan test network;average transaction fee;average run time;web3.js API;time 3.5 s","","","","20","IEEE","28 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, a translation mechanism can be set up to accomplish a conversion from the asset model to an executable contract program. On this basis, we propose a new language design toward asset-driven specific smart contracts, called TA-SPESC. This language complies with the structure of real-world contracts and supports a formal definition composed of four modules: Party, asset, term, and contract attribute. This asset model on it can be used to define various types of rights (including the right of ownership, use, possession, usufruct, and disposition of assets), as well as five asset operations (including asset registration, deposit, withdrawal, transfer, and cancellation) to effectively support asset transaction. More important, a series of generation rules are proposed to translate the TA-SPESC contract to an executable contract program. Moreover, taking house rental contract as an example, we provide a TA-SPESC instance and its specific description of translation process according to the generation rules, which supports a semiautomatic generation to executable programs. Finally, the Solidity codes derived from TA-SPESC contracts are run and tested, and the experiment and comparison results indicate that TA-SPESC contracts have high abstraction and low complexity, as well as versatility and convenience of asset transaction, which lead to more reliable software with less errors and fewer misunderstanding.","1558-1721","","10.1109/TR.2021.3054617","National Key Research and Development Program of China Stem Cell and Translational Research(grant numbers:2018YFB1402702); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972032); Chinese Institute of Electronics(grant numbers:T/CIE 095-2020,CN202010381549.5); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9356844","Advanced contract language;asset representation;asset transaction;generation rules;right classification;smart legal contract","Smart contracts;Blockchain;Syntactics;Standards;Computer languages;Business;Solid modeling","contracts;formal specification;rental;specification languages","asset-driven smart contract language;asset model;real-world contracts;executable contract program;asset-driven specific smart contracts;called TA-SPESC;contract attribute;asset operations;including asset registration;asset transaction;generation rules;TA-SPESC contract;house rental contract;TA-SPESC instance","","9","","22","IEEE","18 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such BCs allow for the building of SCs that own resources and manage a set of permissions describing who is allowed to interact with these resources and what actions they can apply to them. However, Programming Languages (PL) and run-time systems used in current BCs lack a secure, flexible, and straightforward way to implement permissions within their SCs, leading to erroneous implementations that allow unauthorized access. The best-known incident related to a permission problem was the ""Parity Hack"", which led to the ""loss"" of tokens, valued at approximately 31 M USD.A better and secure SC access control concept provides an improved path to managing permissions. Thus, this paper presents a novel concept for handling permissions compatible with functional SC languages leveraging opaque and substructural data types to provide capability-based permission management. The opaque data types enforce that only designated functions can create permission carrying capabilities. Substructural data types prevent an unpermitted duplication of capabilities.","","978-1-6654-3578-9","10.1109/ICBC51069.2021.9461117","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9461117","Blockchain;Smart Contracts;programming languages;access control;capabilities;substructural data types","Access control;Computer languages;Computer hacking;Conferences;Smart contracts;Buildings;Blockchain","authorisation;blockchains;contracts;functional languages","functional SC languages;capability-based permission management;permission carrying capabilities;SAMOS;public blockchains;BC;SC access control;smart contract access management over opaque and substructural types","","2","","19","IEEE","24 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, smart contracts, which execute automatically when certain conditions are met, can address some of the deficiencies of existing problems associated with contract laws and their enforcement in Southern countries. In many cases, the real challenge is in the interpretation of the contract rather than the breach by a party. Often, an uncertainty about the meaning of the terms in a contract presents questions of interpretation.2 Since smart contracts are enforced by software codes, many of the interpretation-related problems are not likely to occur in such platforms. Among the major benefits, smart contracts can dramatically reduce costs associated with verification and enforcement. Other advantages include higher speed, precision, efficiency, and transparency. A key challenge in this is how Southern countries can benefit from blockchain and its potentially disruptive application in smart contracts.

We first collect 146,452 open-source smart contract projects from Ethereum and then perform a detailed analysis. We first study how often the smart contract projects reuse and then we identify the top reused smart contracts and analyze how the developers revise smart contracts during reuse. Our research suggests that the code reuse in smart contract is quite frequent because about 26% contract code blocks are reused and the average time of reuse is 14.6. And the top reused contracts are almost all related to ERC20 token, which reveals that the current smart contract ecosystem is relatively homogenous.

The existing agricultural food supply chains present several major problems, such as numerous participants, inconvenient communication caused by long supply chain cycles, data distrust between participants and the centralized system. The emergence of blockchain technology effectively solves the pain-point problem existing in the traceability system of agricultural food supply chains. This paper proposes a framework based on the consortium and smart contracts to track and trace the workflow of agricultural food supply chains, implement traceability and shareability of supply chains, and break down the information islands between enterprises as much as possible to eliminate the need for the central institutions and agencies and improve the integrity of the transaction records, reliability and security. At the same time, farmers record details of the environment and crop growth data in the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and store file IPFS hashes in smart contracts, which not only increases data security but also alleviates the blockchain storage explosion problem. This framework has been applied in Shanwei Lvfengyuan Modern Agricultural Development Co., Ltd. Although there are still many defects, the framework has successfully realized functions such as disintermediation and tracing of agricultural product information through QR codes.

However, the bugs and vulnerabilities in smart contracts have brought huge economic losses, which has strengthened people's attention to the security issues of smart contracts. The immutability of smart contracts makes people more willing to conduct security checks before deploying smart contracts. Nonetheless, existing smart contract vulnerability detection techniques are far away from enough: static analysis approaches rely heavily on manually crafted heuristics which is difficult to reuse across different types of vulnerabilities while deep learning based approaches also have unique limitations. In this study, we propose a novel approach, Peculiar, which uses Pre-training technique for detection of smart contract vulnerabilities based on crucial data flow graph. Compared against the traditional data flow graph which is already utilized in existing approach, crucial data flow graph is less complex and does not bring an unnecessarily deep hierarchy, which makes the model easy to focus on the critical features. Moreover, we also involve pre-training technique in our model due to the dramatic improvements it has achieved on a variety of NLP tasks.

A blockchain developer should expect constant changes in the security software field, as new bugs and security risks are discovered, and new good practices are developed. Following the security practices accepted in the blockchain community is not enough to ensure the writing of secure smart contracts. The paper aims to study the practice of code cloning among the smart contracts by analyzing two corpora. The first corpus, the ""Smart-Corpus"", includes smart contracts already deployed in the Ethereum blockchain. The second corpus, the ""Open-Zeppelin's Solidity Library"", is supervised by a community of developers who constantly take care to increase the security and efficiency of the smart contracts included in the corpus. From the comparative analysis of the corpora, we observe that the smart contracts developers frequently duplicate the code by cloning already existing smart contracts which are not part of the ""OpenZeppelin corpus"". In particular, we found that 79.1% of smart contracts contain duplicated code and only 18.4% of smart contracts reuse the code by implementing a smart corpus belonging to the OpenZeppelin repository. The paper discusses the advantages and the disadvantages of code duplication in the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem, and suggests to refer to the smart contracts of the OpenZeppelin's Solidity Library. The Ethereum blockchain community can indeed benefit from using the tested code presented in OpenZeppelin's Solidity Library to increase its security.","1534-5351","978-1-7281-9630-5","10.1109/SANER50967.2021.00089","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9426068","code duplication;smart contract;Ethereum blockchain","Smart contracts;Cloning;Blockchain;Writing;Tools;Market research;Libraries","blockchains;contracts;public domain software;software maintenance;source code (software)","smart contract developers;smart corpus;writing smart contracts;secure smart contracts;Ethreum smart contracts;source code duplication;blockchain developer;security software field;code cloning;Open-Zeppelin Solidity Library;code duplication;Ethereum blockchain community","","","","34","IEEE","11 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Smart-Graph: Graphical Representations for Smart Contract on the Ethereum Blockchain","G. A.

The smart contracts can facilitate, verify, and implement the negotiation between multiple parties, also guaranteeing transactions without a traditional legal entity. Many tools supporting the smart contracts development in different areas are flourishing because in Ethereum blockchain valuable assets are often involved. Some of the tools help the developer to find security vulnerabilities via static and/or dynamic analysis or to reduce the Gas fees consumption. Despite the plethora of such tools, there is no tool supporting smart contracts evaluation and analysis via a graphical representation for expert developers.The paper embraces this way to facilitate the developers’ analysis activity, by proposing a graphical representation model to visualize smart contract source code. The paper makes available a tool via a web interface, which accepts the smart contract address as an input and produces a graphical representation of the smart contract as an output. The graphical representation can help developers to better understand the structure of smart contracts and share it with other developers. Moreover, some metrics, such as the relations among smart contracts, are easier to be understood via ""spatial"" than ""tabular"" representation. Indeed, representing smart contracts’ metrics via visual representation facilitates the developers, who are used to analyse the source code by directly inspecting it or using other tools that provide the metrics in a table format. Finally, the paper provides detailed data regarding a smart contract to the developers and proposes a graphical representation of the smart contracts without obscuration of details, also highlighting areas of the code that are possibly too big in size and/or too complex via a diagram displaying their connections.","1534-5351","978-1-7281-9630-5","10.1109/SANER50967.2021.00090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9425959","Smart contract;Ethereum blockchain;visual analysis;class diagram","Measurement;Visualization;Law;Conferences;Smart contracts;Unified modeling language;Blockchain","blockchains;Internet","smart contract address;graphical representation;smart contracts development;smart contracts evaluation;smart contract source code;Ethereum blockchain;visual representation","","6","","38","IEEE","11 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Here, we describe how the BPMN model is transformed into a multimodal model that combines DE-HSM modeling. We provide a high-level overview of the method and review how BPMN categories of elements are transformed into a multi-modal DE-HSM model. We also describe briefly how the DE-FMS model is automatically transformed into deployable smart contracts that interact to form a distributed application: The smart contract deployed on the main blockchain coordinates activities amongst the business partners and interoperates with smart contracts, also automatically prepared and deployed on a sidechain(s), with one smart contract per individual business partner. Privacy is obtained by performing activities, which are not germane to the collaboration with the other business partners but deal with the private activities of the individual business partner, in a smart contract deployed and executed on a side chain. We thus provide for interoperability of smart contracts and privacy as private activities of a business partner are performed in a smart contract on a private sidechain.","2409-2983","978-1-6654-2714-2","10.1109/ICEET53442.2021.9659771","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9659771","Blockchain;Business Processes Modeling Notation (BPMN);Discrete Event (DE) Modeling;Finite State Machine (FSM);Hierarchical State Machines (HSM);Smart Contract;Smart Contract Deployment;Off-chain computation;Privacy;Smart Contract Interoperability","Privacy;Process modeling;Computational modeling;Scalability;Smart contracts;Finance;Collaboration","blockchains;business data processing;business process re-engineering;contracts;data privacy;open systems","smart contract deployment;interoperability;DE-HSM multimodal model;blockchains;Business Process Model and Notation;BPMN;DE-FMS model;privacy;scalability;private sidechain","","1","","14","IEEE","5 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The cost for executing smart contract code is metered using gas - the exact amount of which is based on the computational complexity of the underlying smart contract. Hence, it is imperative to optimize smart contract code to reduce gas consumption and, in some instances, to even avoid malicious attacks. In this paper, we propose an approach to optimize the gas consumption of smart contracts, specifically loop control structures. We present a prototype implementation of our approach using off-the-shelf tools for Solidity smart contracts. We experimentally evaluate our technique using 72 Solidity smart contracts. Our evaluation demonstrates the average gas cost savings per transaction to be around 23,943 gas units, or an equivalent 21% decrease in gas costs. Although the approach causes a slight increase in deployment costs due to the additional internal functions, this is only 16,710 gas units on the average, or a 5% of the total deployment cost. As this overhead remains quite reasonable when compared to the gas cost savings for each transaction, it also confirms the efficacy, practicality and effectiveness of the proposed methodology.","","978-1-6654-3924-4","10.1109/BRAINS52497.2021.9569819","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9569819","Smart contracts;Gas;Verification;Synthesis","Costs;Codes;Smart contracts;Prototypes;Manuals;Tools;Maintenance engineering","blockchains;computational complexity;contracts;gas industry;metering;power engineering computing;smart power grids","gas optimization;programmable code;smart contract code;gas consumption;Solidity smart contracts;average gas cost savings;smart contract refinement;deployment costs;computational complexity;loop control structures","","1","","41","IEEE","25 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a method to measure the similarity of smart contract bytecode. Firstly, the key opcode combination of smart contract is summarized. When traversing the CFG(control flow graph) constructed by decompilation of smart contract bytecode, the opcodes in the basic block are pattern matched, and the features between the basic blocks are extracted according to the in-out degree, so as to enhance the similarity measurement effect of contract semantics in vector space.

However, these mechanisms raise concerns about fairness, privacy, vote concealment, fair calculations of tally, and proxies voting on their behalf for the voters. Ballot voting, and in recent times, electronic voting via electronic voting machines (EVMs) improves fairness by relying on centralized trust. Homomorphic encryption-based voting protocols also assure fairness but cannot scale to large scale elections such as presidential elections. In this paper, we leverage the blockchain technology of distributing trust to propose a smart contract-based protocol, namely, FASTEN. There are many existing protocols for voting using smart contracts. We observe that these either are not scalable or leak the vote tally during the voting stage, i.e., do not provide vote concealment. In contrast, we show that FASTEN preserves voter's privacy ensures vote concealment, immutability, and avoids double voting. We prove that the probability of privacy breaches is negligibly small. Further, our cost analysis of executing FASTEN over Ethereum is comparable to most of the existing cost of elections.","","978-1-6654-3578-9","10.1109/ICBC51069.2021.9461060","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9461060","Distributed Trust;Blockchain;Smart Contracts;Ethereum","Conferences;Smart contracts;Blockchain;Privacy breach;Cryptocurrency;Cost benefit analysis;Electronic voting","cryptographic protocols;data privacy;government data processing;politics","FASTEN;secure distributed voting;smart contracts;vote concealment;fair calculations;proxies voting;ballot voting;electronic voting machines;homomorphic encryption-based voting;scale elections;smart contract-based protocol;voting stage;double voting","","4","","11","IEEE","24 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The leakage of these data will cause very serious consequences. Traditional access control is prone to single point of failure. The existing researches on the combination of blockchain and access control have some disadvantages, such as the difficulty of managing access rights, inefficient access efficiency, and the difficulty of supporting lightweight IOT devices. This paper proposes an IoT access control model based on blockchain smart contract, called SCBAC. Firstly, by adopting the idea of IoT Attributes Based Access Control(ABAC), the model supports a dynamic, fine-grained access control. Secondly, by deploying the access control strategy on the blockchain in the form of smart contracts, the computing pressure of IoT devices is reduced, so that the model can be applied to lightweight IoT devices and has tamper resistance and traceability characteristics. The idea of tokens is adopted into the strategy, and subjects obtain access rights by applying for tokens in advance, which improves access efficiency. In addition, Trust recommendation algorithm is adopted in the model, which effectively solves the problem of identity fraud in access control. Finally, we build a prototype system to verify this proposed model, through case analysis and security analysis, it shows that this access control model is effective and versatile. Furthermore, the model can be used as a reference for other IoT applications with access control security requirements.","2689-6621","978-1-7281-8028-1","10.1109/IAEAC50856.2021.9390662","North China University of Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9390662","Internet of Thing;Access control;Smart contracts;Blockchain","Access control;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Smart contracts;Blockchain;Permission;Internet of Things","authorisation;Internet of Things","user sensitive data;access rights;IoT access control model;blockchain smart contract;fine-grained access control;access control strategy;smart contracts;lightweight IoT devices;access control security requirements;Internet of Things","","","","19","IEEE","5 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At the same time, it also affects the versatility of the chain architecture. In response to the above problems, this paper designs a pluggable multi-smart contract engine. The engine has three major characteristics. One is the access to multiple contract virtual machines with engine adapters as the core module, and a standardized engine interface is provided. Developers only need to implement the corresponding functions according to the interface description to complete the access; the second is pluggability, which supports the access and removal of smart contract virtual machines, which is convenient for system management and also facilitates the performance of the contract engine; The third is the engine interface module.

However, it also causes severe concerns due to improper use of individuals’ private data, as well as the lack of transparency and auditability for data usage. To bridge this gap, in this article, we propose a secure and auditable private data sharing (SPDS) scheme under data processing-as-a-service mode in smart grid. Specifically, we first present a novel blockchain-based framework for trust-free private data computation and data usage tracking, where smart contracts are employed to specify fine-grained data usage policies (i.e., who can access what kinds of data, for what purposes, at what price) while the distributed ledgers keep an immutable and transparent record of data usage. A trusted execution environment based off-chain smart contract execution mechanism is exploited as well to process confidential user datasets and relieve the computation overhead in blockchain systems. A two-phase atomic delivery protocol is designed to ensure the atomicity of data transactions in computing result release and payment. Furthermore, based on contract theory, the optimal contracts are designed under information asymmetry to stimulate user's participation and high-quality data sharing while optimizing the payoff of the energy service provider. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SPDS can effectively improve the payoffs of participants, compared with conventional schemes.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2020.3040171","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1808207,91746114); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality(grant numbers:18510761000); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9268472","Blockchain;off-chain;private data sharing;smart contract;smart grid;trusted computing","Blockchain;Smart contracts;Smart grids;Distributed databases;Cryptography;Companies;Data privacy","authorisation;contracts;cryptographic protocols;data privacy;smart power grids","secure data;auditable private data;smart grid;smart meters;smart appliances;efficient energy production;personalized energy services;transparency;auditability;data processing-as-a-service mode;novel blockchain-based framework;trust-free private data computation;smart contracts;fine-grained data usage policies;off-chain smart contract execution mechanism;data transactions;high-quality data;energy service provider","","41","","41","IEEE","24 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When input constraints or security properties are violated at runtime, the transaction being executed by a smart contract needs to be reverted to avoid undesirable consequences. On Ethereum, the most popular blockchain that supports smart contracts, developers can choose among three transaction-reverting statements (i.e., require, if…revert, and if…throw) to handle anomalous transactions. While these transaction-reverting statements are vital for preventing smart contracts from exhibiting abnormal behaviors or suffering malicious attacks, there is limited understanding of how they are used in practice. In this work, we perform the first empirical study to characterize transaction-reverting statements in Ethereum smart contracts. We measured the prevalence of these statements in 3,866 verified smart contracts from popular dapps and built a taxonomy of their purposes via manually analyzing 557 transaction-reverting statements. We also compared template contracts and their corresponding custom contracts to understand how developers customize the use of transaction-reverting statements. Finally, we analyzed the security impact of transaction-reverting statements by removing them from smart contracts and comparing the mutated contracts against the original ones. Our study led to important findings. For example, we found that transaction-reverting statements are commonly used to perform seven types of authority verifications or validity checks, and missing such statements may compromise the security of smart contracts. We also found that current smart contract security analyzers cannot effectively handle transaction-reverting statements when detecting security vulnerabilities. Our findings can shed light on further research in the broad area of smart contract quality assurance and provide practical guidance to smart contract developers on the appropriate use of transaction-reverting statements.","2643-1572","978-1-6654-0337-5","10.1109/ASE51524.2021.9678597","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9678597","Ethereum;smart contract;transaction-reverting statement;empirical study;security vulnerability","Runtime;Quality assurance;Smart contracts;Taxonomy;Decentralized applications;Blockchains;Security","blockchains;contracts;electronic money;transaction processing","Ethereum smart contracts;transaction-reverting statements;smart contract quality assurance;authority verifications;validity checks;smart contract security analyzers;security vulnerabilities","","5","","54","IEEE","20 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the emergence of blockchain, new solutions with this technology to existing problems were devised, leading to the introduction of smart contracts. Smart contracts are similar to traditional contracts with the benefits provided by blockchain, such as immutability, privacy, and decentralisation. These contracts are usually defined based on a specific domain, and this domain knowledge can be represented through an ontology. Researches have explored the benefits of using domain ontologies with smart contracts, such as code generation, discovering other contracts in the network, or interaction with other contracts. Notwithstanding, the representation of smart contract languages themselves has not been studied. In this paper, we present an ontology for a well-known smart contract language, Solidity, defining all entities needed to cover the whole language and aligning it to other standardised ontologies such as EthOn, in a way to improve the knowledge of the ontology developed. Furthermore, the ontology has also been validated with already deployed contracts in the Ethereum blockchain. Thus, Solidity will be able to benefit from the advantages provided by ontologies, such as interoperability and the use of semantic web technologies.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3115577","European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme through the DELTA Project(grant numbers:773960); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9548044","Ontology;smart contracts;solidity;blockchain","Ontologies;Smart contracts;Blockchains;Contracts;Codes;Java;Standards","blockchains;contracts;ontologies (artificial intelligence);open systems;semantic Web","ontological modeling;Solidity;blockchain;traditional contracts;domain ontologies;smart contract language;deployed contracts;code generation;interoperability;semantic web technologies","","2","","33","CCBY","24 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This feature has encouraged various sectors to make use of smart contracts when transacting. Experience shows that many deployed contracts are vulnerable to exploitation due to their poor design, which allows attackers to steal valuable assets from the involved parties. Therefore, an assessment approach that allows developers to recognise the consequences of deploying vulnerable contracts is needed. In this paper, we propose a debt-aware approach for assessing security design vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Our assessment approach involves two main steps: (i) identification of design vulnerabilities using security analysis techniques and (ii) an estimation of the ramifications of the identified vulnerabilities leveraging the technical debt metaphor, its principal and interest. We use examples of vulnerable contracts to demonstrate the applicability of our approach. The results show that our assessment approach increases the visibility of security design issues. It also allows developers to concentrate on resolving smart contract vulnerabilities through technical debt impact analysis and prioritisation. Developers can use our approach to inform the design of more secure contracts and for reducing unintentional debts caused by a lack of awareness of security issues.","","978-1-6654-1405-0","10.1109/TechDebt52882.2021.00010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9463047","smart contract;technical debt;security","Visualization;Smart contracts;Estimation;Tools;Software;Security","contracts;security of data","security design vulnerabilities;security analysis techniques;identified vulnerabilities;technical debt metaphor;vulnerable contracts;security design issues;smart contract vulnerabilities;technical debt impact analysis;prioritisation;secure contracts;smart contracts security technical debts;deployed contracts;debt-aware approach","","2","","47","IEEE","25 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, the term is popularly used to refer to low-level code scripts running on a blockchain platform. Our study focuses exclusively on this subset of smart contracts. Such smart contracts have increasingly been gaining ground, finding numerous important applications (e.g., crowdfunding) in the real world. Despite the increasing popularity, smart contract development still remains somewhat a mystery to many developers largely due to its special design and applications. Are there any differences between smart contract development and traditional software development? What kind of challenges are faced by developers during smart contract development? Questions like these are important but have not been explored by researchers yet. In this paper, we performed an exploratory study to understand the current state and potential challenges developers are facing in developing smart contracts on blockchains, with a focus on Ethereum (the most popular public blockchain platform for smart contracts). Toward this end, we conducted this study in two phases. In the first phase, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 developers from GitHub and industry professionals who are working on smart contracts. In the second phase, we performed a survey on 232 practitioners to validate the findings from the interviews. Our interview and survey results revealed several major challenges developers are facing during smart contract development: (1) there is no effective way to guarantee the security of smart contract code; (2) existing tools for development are still very basic; (3) the programming languages and the virtual machines still have a number of limitations; (4) performance problems are hard to handle under resource constrained running environment; and (5) online resources (including advanced/updated documents and community support) are still limited.

First, we statically analyze smart contract bytecodes to predict which transaction sequences will lead to effective testing, and figure out if there is a certain constraint that each transaction should satisfy. Such information is then passed to the fuzzing phase and used to construct an initial seed corpus. During a fuzzing campaign, we perform a lightweight dynamic data-flow analysis to collect data-flow-based feedback to effectively guide fuzzing.

Users are charged with fees, a.k.a. gas in Ethereum, when they create, deploy or execute smart contracts. Since smart contracts may contain vulnerabilities which may result in huge financial loss, developers and smart contract compilers often insert codes for security checks. The trouble is that those codes consume gas every time they are executed. Many of the inserted codes are however redundant. In this work, we present sOptimize, a tool that optimizes smart contract gas consumption automatically without compromising functionality or security. sOptimize works on smart contract bytecode, statically identifies 3 kinds of code patterns, and further removes them through verification-assisted techniques. The resulting code is guaranteed to be equivalent to the original one and can be directly deployed on blockchain. We evaluate sOptimize on a collection of 1,152 real-world smart contracts and show that it optimizes 43% of them, and the reduction on gas consumption is about 2.0% while in deployment and 1.2% in transactions, the amount can be as high as 954,201 gas units per contract.","2640-0715","978-1-6654-3784-4","10.1109/APSEC53868.2021.00034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9711954","smart contract;optimization;gas reduction","Codes;Smart contracts;Static analysis;Blockchains;Security;Software engineering","blockchains;contracts;program verification;protocols","verification assisted gas reduction;smart contract compilers;smart contract gas consumption;smart contract bytecode;sOptimize;blockchain networks;security checks;computerized transaction protocols;Ethereum","","1","","34","IEEE","17 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A user cannot differentiate between a website link to a legitimate smart contract set up by a reputable business owner and that to an illicit contract aiming to defraud the user. Surprisingly, current attempts to resolve this issue are based mostly on information redundancy, e.g., displaying contract addresses multiple times in varying forms of images and text. These verification processes are burdensome because the user is responsible for verifying the accuracy of an address. More importantly, these measures do not address the core problem because the contract itself does not contain information on its authenticity. To resolve such limitations and to increase security, we propose a solution that leverages publicly issued Transport Layer Security (TLS)/Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates of Fully-Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) to ensure the authenticity of smart contracts and their owners. Our approach combines on-chain endorsement storage that utilizes signatures from the respective certificate and off-chain authentication of the smart contract. The system is open and transparent because the only requirement for usage is ownership of a TLS/SSL certificate. Further, moderate deployment and maintenance costs, a widely accepted public key infrastructure, and a simple interface enable TLS/SSL endorsed smart contracts (TeSC) to bridge the gap between websites and smart contracts.","","978-1-6654-3485-0","10.1109/DAPPS52256.2021.00016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9566203","blockchain;authentication;smart contracts;Ethereum;certificates","Image resolution;Distributed ledger;Sockets;Smart contracts;Redundancy;Public key;Maintenance engineering","financial data processing;public key cryptography;Web sites","smart contract addresses;legitimate smart contract;illicit contract;TeSC;TLS-certificate endorsed smart contracts;SSL-certificate endorsed smart contract;verification process;Secure Sockets Layer certificates;Transport Layer Security certificates;fully-qualified domain names;FQDN;on-chain endorsement storage;off-chain authentication","","3","","19","IEEE","20 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We particularly focus on licensing of proprietary intellectual property (IP) that is embedded in Internet of Things (IoT) devices and services (e.g. patented technologies). To achieve this we propose to encode the logic of license agreements into smart licenses (SL). We define a SL as a `digital twin' of a licensing contract, i.e. one or more smart contracts that represent the full or relevant parts of a licensing agreement in machine readable and executable code. As SL are self enforcing, the royalty computation and execution of payments can be fully automated in a tamper free and trustworthy way. This of course, requires to employ a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Such an Automated Licensing Payment System (ALPS) can thus automate an established business process and solve a longstanding trust issue in licensing markets. It renders traditional costly audits obsolete, lowers entry barriers for those who want to participate in licensing markets, and enables novel business models too complex with traditional approaches.","","978-1-6654-3578-9","10.1109/ICBC51069.2021.9461145","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9461145","Distributed Ledger Technology;Smart Contract;License Agreement;Intellectual Property;Blockchain","Industries;Distributed ledger;Smart contracts;Distributed databases;Intellectual property;Licenses;Internet of Things","business data processing;contracts;industrial property;Internet of Things;knowledge management;security of data","ALPS;distributed ledger technology;SL;IoT;intellectual property;Internet of Things;licensing agreement;smart contracts;licensing contract;license agreements;trust problem;DLT smart licenses;IP Licensing;licensing markets;Automated Licensing Payment System","","2","","13","IEEE","24 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Matching-based detection methods extrapolating known vulnerabilities to unknown have proven to be effective in other platforms. However, directly adopting the technique to smart contracts is obstructed by two issues, i.e., diversity of bytecode generation resulting from the rapid evolution of compilers and interference of noise code easily caused by the homogeneous business logics. To address the problems, we propose contract bytecode-oriented normalization and slicing techniques to augment bytecode matching. Specifically, we conduct data- and instruction-level normalizations to uniform the bytecode generated by different compilers, and enforce contract-specific slicing by tracking data- and control-flows with simulated bytecode executions to prune the noise code as far as possible. Based on the above techniques, we design an unsupervised graph embedding algorithm to encode the code graphs into quantitatively comparable vectors. The potentially vulnerable smart contracts can be identified by measuring the similarities between their vectors and known vulnerable ones. Our evaluations have shown the efficiency (0.47 seconds per contract on average), effectiveness (160 verified true positives) and high precision (91.95% for top-ranked). It is worth noting that, we also identify dozens of honeypot contracts, further demonstrating the capability of our method.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2021.3050051","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:U1836209,61802413); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Research Funds of Renmin University of China(grant numbers:19XNLG02,20XNLG03); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9316905","Vulnerable smart contracts;graph embedding;bytecode matching","Smart contracts;Task analysis;Interference;Blockchain;Prototypes;Business;Virtual machining","contracts;graph theory;pattern matching;program compilers;security of data;software maintenance;unsupervised learning","matching-based detection methods;resultant financial losses;smart contract vulnerabilities;graph embedding;honeypot contracts;potentially vulnerable smart contracts;unsupervised graph;simulated bytecode executions;contract-specific slicing;instruction-level normalizations;bytecode matching;slicing techniques;homogeneous business logics;noise code;bytecode generation","","14","","48","IEEE","8 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For this, we propose four forms of smart contracts for user verification, access authorization, misbehavior detection, and access revocation, respectively. In this framework, considering the block size of ledger and huge amount of patient data, the EMRs are stored in cloud after being encrypted through the cryptographic functions of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and Edwards-curve digital signature algorithm (EdDSA), while their corresponding hashes are packed into blockchain.

The restricting properties of the blockchain environment, such as the immutability of deployed contracts, encumber the analysis and mitigation of vulnerabilities and bugs in deployed contracts. To address these challenges, we propose EtherProv, a novel provenance tracking system that leverages static and dynamic analysis synergy to enable detection and mitigation of known security issues in Ethereum smart contracts. EtherProv leverages Solidity source code static and dynamic analysis data through contract bytecode instrumentation. The collected data is transformed into a unified, high-level representation, which can be queried using concise and descriptive Datalog queries. Within the provenance framework, EtherProv is able to analyze contracts' execution flow over time, to detect vulnerabilities within a single contract execution flow and across multiple interacting contracts, and to mitigate new security threats in already deployed contracts. Our evaluation shows that EtherProv can efficiently and precisely identify vulnerable contracts with an average contract instrumentation gas overhead of 18.9%.","","978-1-6654-1760-0","10.1109/Blockchain53845.2021.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9680507","Blockchain;security;provenance;smart contracts;vulnerability-analysis;debugging","Codes;Liquids;Instruments;Conferences;Smart contracts;Computer bugs;Companies","blockchains;contracts;data integrity;program diagnostics","EtherProv;static analysis;dynamic analysis;provenance-aware detection;blockchain technologies;smart contracts vulnerabilities;provenance tracking system;Ethereum smart contract security;contract execution flow;security threats mitigation","","","","35","IEEE","24 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Testing is one of the main activities that can help to improve the reliability of a smart contract, so as to possibly prevent considerable loss of valuable assets. It is therefore important to provide the testers with tools that permit them to assess the activity they performed.Mutation testing is a powerful approach for assessing the fault-detection capability of a test suite. In this paper, we propose SuMo, a novel mutation testing tool for Ethereum Smart Contracts. SuMo implements a set of 44 mutation operators that were designed starting from the latest Solidity documentation, and from well-known mutation testing tools. These allow to simulate a wide variety of faults that can be made by smart contract developers. The set of operators was designed to limit the generation of stillborn mutants, which slow down the mutation testing process and limit the usability of the tool. We report a first evaluation of SuMo on open-source projects for which test suites were available. The results we got are encouraging, and they suggest that SuMo can effectively help developers to deliver more reliable smart contracts.","","978-1-6654-3567-3","10.1109/AST52587.2021.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9463055","Mutation Testing;Solidity;Smart contracts","Automation;Smart contracts;Documentation;Blockchain;Tools;Software reliability;Usability","contracts;program compilers;program testing;software fault tolerance","blockchain infrastructure;test suite;SuMo;mutation testing tool;ethereum smart contracts;mutation operators;mutation testing tools;smart contract developers;mutation testing process;solidity smart contracts","","5","","23","IEEE","28 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Smart contracts have become lucrative and profitable targets for attackers because they can hold a large amount of money. This paper takes stock of cryptocurrency crime by assessing attacks due to smart contracts and the cost of losses. These losses are often the result of two types of malicious contracts: vulnerable contracts and criminal smart contracts. Studying the behavior of malicious contracts allows us to understand the root causes and consequences of attacks and the defense capabilities that exist although they do not definitively solve the crime problem.

Existing machine learning and deep learning methods addressing vulnerabilities in smart contracts often partially combine pooled features from first the contract source code, second, the build based approach made of features extracted during source code compilation, and third, the bytecode approach relying on features obtained from the Ethereum virtual machine bytecode analysis. Together those three approaches form the full-stack, and they are usually being conducted under static analysis thanks to its speed of execution. However, to the best of our knowledge, no single work has yet simultaneously undertaken a full-stack intralayer and cross-layer features fusion for smart contracts vulnerability assessment under static analysis, without making use of expert-based patterns nor without manually fusing the various features extracted from shuffled partial combinations of layers in the full-stack. This paper introduces a full-stack hierarchical fusion of static features for smart contracts vulnerability detection. In our construction, we associate each layer of the full-stack to a modality and leverage automatic intramodality and crossmodality pooled features fusion from state-of-the-art artificial neural networks and deep neural networks. Additionally, our models are applied to the hierarchy of power set layers in the full-stack, without any expert-based rule.

We parse smart contract code into word streams with code structural information, convert code elements (e.g., statements, functions) into numerical vectors that are supposed to encode the code syntax and semantics, and compare the similarities among the vectors encoding code and known bugs, to identify potential issues. We have implemented the approach in a prototype, named SmartEmbed,11.The anonymous replication packages can be accessed at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kauLT3y2IiHPkUlVx4FSTda-dVAyL4za/view?usp=sharing.  and evaluated it with more than 22,000 smart contracts collected from the Ethereum blockchain. Results show that our tool can effectively identify many repetitive instances of Solidity code, where the clone ratio is around 90 percent. Code clones such as type-III or even type-IV semantic clones can also be detected accurately. Our tool can identify more than 1000 clone related bugs based on our bug databases efficiently and accurately. Our tool can also help to efficiently validate any given smart contract against a known set of bugs, which can help to improve the users’ confidence in the reliability of the contract.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2020.2971482","Australian Research Council(grant numbers:DE200100021); ARC Discovery(grant numbers:DP170101932); Ministry of Education - Singapore(grant numbers:Tier 1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8979435","Smart contract;code embedding;clone detection;bug detection;ethereum;blockchain","Computer bugs;Smart contracts;Cloning;Blockchains;Security","blockchains;contracts;program debugging;software maintenance;text analysis","parse smart contract code;smart contract security;structural code embedding;bugs;Ethereum blockchain;vulnerabilities;clone detection;bug detection;vector space comparison;word embeddings;word streams","","33","","76","IEEE","3 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Aiming to find out the effect of ABI on the classification of smart contracts, we propose an automatic classification method that utilize popular text classification method on ABI granularity.

For end-users who have never seen the source code, they can read the user notice shown in end-user client to understand what a transaction does of a smart contract function. However, due to time constraints or lack of motivation, user notice is often missing during the development of smart contracts. For end-users who lack the information of the user notices, there is no easy way for them to check the code semantics of the smart contracts. Thus, in this paper, we propose a new approach SMARTDOC to generate user notice for smart contract functions automatically. Our tool can help end-users better understand the smart contract and aware of the financial risks, improving the users’ confidence on the reliability of the smart contracts. SMARTDOC exploits the Transformer to learn the representation of source code and generates natural language descriptions from the learned representation. We also integrate the Pointer mechanism to copy words from the input source code instead of generating words during the prediction process. We extract 7,878 〈function, notice〉 pairs from 54,739 smart contracts written in Solidity. Due to the limited amount of collected smart contract functions (i.e., 7,878 functions), we exploit a transfer learning technique to utilize the learned knowledge to improve the performance of SMARTDOC. The learned knowledge obtained by the pre-training on a corpus of Java code, that has similar characteristics as Solidity code. The experimental results show that our approach can effectively generate user notice given the source code and significantly outperform the state-of-the-art approaches. To investigate human perspectives on our generated user notice, we also conduct a human evaluation and ask participants to score user notice generated by different approaches. Results show that SMARTDOC outperforms baselines from three aspects, naturalness, informativeness, and similarity.","2643-1572","978-1-6654-0337-5","10.1109/ASE51524.2021.9678552","National Science Foundation; Research and Development; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9678552","Smart Contract;User Notice Generation;Deep Learning","Java;Codes;Smart contracts;Transfer learning;Semantics;Natural languages;Transformers","blockchains;contracts;information filtering;Java;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing","collected smart contract functions;source code;generated user notice;score user notice;user notice generation;smart contract function;end-user client;automatic financial transactions;business transactions;code semantics;SMARTDOC;financial risks;natural language descriptions;learned representation;Pointer mechanism;transfer learning technique;learned knowledge;Solidity code;user notice;human evaluation","","2","","49","IEEE","20 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As an example, we couple two smart contract applications on the Ethereum blockchain: Palinodia and DecentID. Palinodia can be used to ensure the integrity of downloaded executable binaries by checking their hashes against the hashes stored in the blockchain. To make sure that not everyone can modify the data stored on the blockchain, an identity management system is required.

The smart contract is at the center of blockchain systems and is a coded specification of an agreement between interacting partners in a transaction. Like other software artifacts, smart contracts are prone to carry residual faults. As many contracts are being used to handle financial transactions, huge losses may occur if a vulnerability is exploited. Also, a faulty contract cannot be corrected once it has been deployed on the blockchain, it can only be terminated and a new one must be deployed, which aggravates the cost of deploying contracts with faults and marks the reputation of the provider. Smart contract verification tools have been emerging, but limited knowledge is available regarding their real effectiveness. In this paper, we define a smart contract defect classification scheme based on the Orthogonal Defect Classification and apply it to a contract dataset, which has been extracted from multiple sources and holds different types of defects. We use the dataset to evaluate three state of the art verification tools regarding their fault detection performance.

Unfortunately, this scripting language is not sophisticated enough to create complex conditions or smart contracts in general. Many admirable efforts have been made to build a smart contract infrastructure on top of the Bitcoin platform. In this paper, given the inherent limitations of the Bitcoin scripting language, we critically analyze the practical effectiveness of these methods. Afterwards, we formally define what a smart contract is and introduce seven requirements that if are satisfied, can make creation of smart contracts for Bitcoin possible. Based on the introduced requirements, we examine the ability of the current methods that use secure Multi-party Computation (MPC) to create smart contracts for Bitcoin and show where they fall short.

Regardless of their intended application, blockchain platforms implicitly assume consensus for the correct execution of a smart contract, thus requiring that all transactions are totally ordered. It was only recently recognized that consensus is not necessary to prevent double-spending in a cryptocurrency, contrary to common belief. This result suggests that current implementations may be sacrificing efficiency and scalability because they synchronize transactions much more tightly than actually needed. In this work, we study the synchronization requirements of Ethereum's ERC20 token contract, one of the most widely adopted smart contacts. Namely, we model a smart-contract token as a concurrent object and analyze its consensus number as a measure of synchronization power. We show that the richer set of methods supported by ERC20 tokens, compared to standard cryptocurrencies, results in strictly stronger synchronization requirements. More surprisingly, the synchronization power of ERC20 tokens depends on the object's state and can thus be modified by method invocations. To prove this result, we develop a dedicated framework to express how the object's state affects the needed synchronization level. Our findings indicate that ERC20 tokens, as well as other token standards, are more powerful and versatile than plain cryptocurrencies, and are subject to dynamic requirements. Developing specific synchronization protocols that exploit these dynamic requirements will pave the way towards more robust and scalable blockchain platforms.","2575-8411","978-1-6654-4513-9","10.1109/ICDCS51616.2021.00067","Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)(grant numbers:200021_188443); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9546529","Smart contracts;Ethereum tokens;synchronization requirements;consensus number","Analytical models;Power measurement;Codes;Scalability;Conferences;Smart contracts;Blockchains","blockchains;contracts;cryptocurrencies;cryptographic protocols;synchronisation;token networks;transaction processing","synchronization power;token smart contracts;modern blockchains;distributed applications;arbitrary code;distributed decentralized fashion;correct execution;smart-contract token;consensus number;standard cryptocurrencies;synchronization requirements;synchronization level;token standards;plain cryptocurrencies;dynamic requirements;specific synchronization protocols;robust blockchain platforms;scalable blockchain platforms;Ethereum ERC;Ethereum ERC20 token contract","","1","","33","IEEE","4 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since IoT devices communicate with external entities for service provision smart homes are vulnerable to security threats. Blockchain is a public distributed ledger which is immutable and can securely store data. One solution for security issues with smart homes can be integrating blockchain and smart homes. This paper proposes a new framework for integrating blockchain and smart home in which a smart contract controls the interaction among IoT devices with external entities. Smart contract of a home is associated with the public key of the householder and can have several subcontracts. Subcontracts are used to govern the interaction between one or more IoT devices and one or more external entities. The successful results of the first prototype of the proposed framework show its potential to appropriately address the security and data privacy issues with smart homes.","","978-1-6654-2798-2","10.1109/ComComAp53641.2021.9652936","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9652936","Smart Home;Internet of Things;Smart Contract;Blockchain;Security","Data privacy;Smart contracts;Public key;Prototypes;Smart homes;Quality of service;Blockchains","blockchains;computer network security;data privacy;home automation;Internet of Things","blockchain;smart home;smart contract;IoT devices;service provision smart homes;security issues;data privacy issues","","","","16","IEEE","30 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Meanwhile, various vulnerabilities in smart contracts have been exploited by attackers to steal cryptocurrencies worth millions of dollars. The automatic detection of smart contract vulnerabilities therefore is an essential research problem. Existing solutions to this problem particularly rely on human experts to define features or different rules to detect vulnerabilities. However, this often causes many vulnerabilities to be ignored, and they are inefficient in detecting new vulnerabilities. In this study, to overcome such challenges, we propose the VSCL framework to automatically detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts on the blockchain. More specifically, first, we utilize novel feature vector generation techniques from bytecode of smart contract since the source code of smart contracts are rarely available in public. Next, the collected vectors are fed into our novel metric learning-based deep neural network(DNN) to get the detection result. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a large-scale benchmark, and the quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.","","978-1-6654-3578-9","10.1109/ICBC51069.2021.9461050","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9461050","Smart Contract;Vulnerability Detection;Metric Learning;Blockchain","Measurement;Deep learning;Conferences;Smart contracts;Blockchain;Benchmark testing;Feature extraction","blockchains;contracts;cryptocurrencies;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction","vulnerability detection automation;deep learning;blockchain technology;cryptocurrencies;smart contract vulnerability automatic detection;VSCL framework;feature vector generation techniques;smart contract bytecode;source code;metric learning-based deep neural network;DNN","","10","","30","IEEE","24 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specific issues arise, such as sharing health Records across institutes or hospitals, problems with misuse of data once shared, no security, etc. The Electronic Health Record (EHR) Framework on Blockchain addresses those issues, resulting from a collaboration of all stakeholders involved. This paper explores the likelihood of representing medical records to make sure data privacy, data accessibility, and data interoperability for the healthcare-specific scenario. Data privacy refers to affording protection to ensure data is available when needed and not used, imparted, accessed, altered, or deleted while being stored or retrieved, or transmitted. Data accessibility is the ability to access the data regardless of natural or artificial accidents, hardware, or others. Improving the accessibility of health data in the healthcare sector while ensuring privacy has been identified as a necessary capability that involves every individual and organization. Traditionally, healthcare interoperability has centered on sharing data between business institutions, such as various hospital systems. The emphasis has lately been on patient-driven information sharing, where the exchange of medical information is patient-mediated and patient-driven. We propose implementing a large-scale information infrastructure to access Smart Contracts sponsored by EHRs as information mediators. The decentralized nature of blockchain technology will aid in making the EHR accessible over a broader network. Using Blockchain will help make far-reaching changes in the healthcare industry by providing immutable, authentic, and accessible medical records, privacy, and faster payments.","2329-7190","978-1-7281-5875-4","10.1109/ICCCI50826.2021.9402689","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9402689","medical information sharing;Blockchain-based EHR;Consent based Health data sharing;Healthcare Record Management","Data privacy;Privacy;Hospitals;Smart contracts;Standards organizations;Blockchain;Stakeholders","blockchains;contracts;data privacy;electronic data interchange;electronic health records;health care;hospitals;information retrieval;open systems","medical services;doctors;data transfer;health institutions;medical information exchange;hospital systems;electronic health record;EHR;data privacy;data accessibility;data interoperability;health data;business institutions;patient-driven information sharing;large-scale information infrastructure;smart contracts;information mediators;blockchain;accessible medical records;authentic medical records;electronic medical health records;health care interoperability;natural accidents;artificial accidents;health care industry;immutable medical records","","3","","11","IEEE","21 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

And with the emergence of consensus algorithms, the throughput rates of permissioned blockchain can be up to thousands of transactions per second. The existing serial execution method for smart contracts becomes a new bottleneck for the system. Due to the lack of mutual trust between nodes, for a batch of smart contracts contained in a block, the traditional two-phase smart contract concurrency approach can only achieve concurrency within a single node, but not the parallel execution of contracts between nodes. In this paper, we propose a new two-phase framework based on trusted hardware Intel SGX, which can avoid the re-execution of all smart contracts on all nodes and improve parallelism between nodes. And consistency between nodes is achieved directly with state replication, rather than by re-executing transactions. We design a pre-execution mechanism for smart contracts in untrusted memory to batch fetch all the state data that a smart contract needs to access to reduce frequent enclave transitions during smart contract execution. Besides, we propose a method that generates a compact read-write set and a data structure named Merkle Forest which can generate the compact Merkle multiproofs for the initial data in untrusted memory in parallel and can quickly verify the correctness of the data passed in the enclave. Finally, we integrate all the techniques proposed in this paper into an open-source system BFT-SMaRt to evaluate our approach in a distributed setting. Experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed methods.","2375-026X","978-1-7281-9184-3","10.1109/ICDE51399.2021.00175","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9458920","Permissioned blockchain;smart contracts;concurrency;SGX","Concurrent computing;Smart contracts;Blockchain;Forestry;Parallel processing;Throughput;Data structures","concurrency (computers);data integrity;data structures;security of data;software fault tolerance","Merkle Forest;data structure;compact read-write set;SGX;high-performance smart contracts concurrent execution;smart contract execution;two-phase smart contract concurrency approach;permissioned blockchain","","7","","21","IEEE","22 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Blockchain has the capability to optimize market transactions using automation with high security to create a peer-to-peer trading environment. It reduces operational risk by enabling transparency, certitude and interoperability in fragmented market systems to eliminate the need for third party regulators to a large extent. In this paper, a decentralized stock exchange system is implemented with Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) on Ethereum for executing trades by separating concerns into three different smart contracts: buyer, seller and exchange. The self-enforcing smart contracts used are highly flexible and optimized for parallel operation due to functional abstraction. The multi-contract model is compared to a single contract model, which handles all three aspects within the same contract, by executing sample trading data from NASDAQ. Transaction fees for the miner at 161 Gwei is 27.96% lesser for the single-contract system and 98.75% lesser for the multi-contract system than the brokerage fees of traditional traders for the same transactions. Experimental results indicate that the separation of concern results in transaction costs being 98.26% lower and transaction time being 28.70% lower than having a single contract.","","978-1-6654-3568-0","10.1109/AIIoT52608.2021.9454189","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9454189","Blockchain;Smart Contract;Stock Market Decentralization;Distributed Ledger Technology;Ethereum","Regulators;Automation;Distributed ledger;Smart contracts;Blockchain;Data models;Peer-to-peer computing","blockchains;contracts;financial data processing;open systems;stock markets","smart contract abstraction;decentralized blockchain based stock exchange;stock markets;centralized structure;operational trade policies;high transaction times;market transactions;peer-to-peer trading environment;interoperability;fragmented market systems;decentralized stock exchange system;distributed ledger technology;multicontract model;single contract model;transaction fees;single-contract system;multicontract system;Ethereum","","2","","49","IEEE","21 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The characteristics of blockchain such as immutability and openness, however, have made DApps more vulnerable to various security risks, and thus it has become of great significance to validate the integrity of DApps before they actually operate upon blockchain. Recently, research on vulnerability in smart contracts (a building block of DApps) has been actively conducted, and various vulnerabilities and their countermeasures were reported. However, the effectiveness of such countermeasures has not been studied well, and no appropriate methods have been proposed to evaluate them. In this paper, we propose a software tool that can easily perform comparative studies by adding existing/new countermeasures and labeled smart contract codes. The proposed tool demonstrates verification performance using various statistical indicators, which helps to identify the most effective countermeasures for each type of vulnerability. Using the proposed tool, we evaluated state-of-the-art countermeasures with 237 labeled benchmark codes. The results indicate that for certain types of vulnerabilities, some countermeasures show evenly good performance scores on various metrics. However, it is also observed that countermeasures that detect the largest number of vulnerable codes typically generate much more false positives, resulting in very low precision and accuracy. Consequently, under given constraints, different countermeasures may be recommended for detecting vulnerabilities of interest. We believe that the proposed tool could effectively be utilized for a future verification study of smart contract applications and contribute to the development of practical and secure smart contract applications.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3091317","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT)(grant numbers:2019R1F1A1063272,2020R1F1A1048395,2020R1A4A3079947); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9461797","Blockchain;countermeasure;Ethereum;smart contract;vulnerability","Smart contracts;Blockchain;Tools;Bitcoin;Benchmark testing;Software tools","blockchains;contracts;software tools;statistical analysis","stastical indicators;secure Ethereum smart contract applications;labeled benchmark codes;software tool;digital security;blockchain technology;smart contract codes;DApps;reliable decentralized applications","","2","","44","CCBYNCND","21 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Indeed, millions of dollars have evaporated due to reentrancy vulnerabilities of smart contracts in past years. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect reentrancy vulnerabilities using fuzz testing and develop a novel tool named ReDefender. Our approach and tool consists of four main steps: (1)preprocess contract to be detected: when a contract uploaded, its source code will be preprocessed by ReDefender to extract candidate pool for fuzzing; (2) generate fuzzing input: fuzzing input will be generated by fuzz engine; (3) collect runtime information: an agent contract is constructed to interact with and attack all contracts to be detected. Runtime information is collected during the execution of every fuzzing input; (4) analyze execution log and find reentrancy: the execution log is analyzed to determine whether a malicious reentrancy occurs. We conduct experiments on 204 tagged smart contracts and show the higher accuracy and lower false positive rate of ReDefender than that of other three famous tools. Moreover, we conduct a new experiment and find 4 reentrancy vulnerabilities in 395 on-chain contract accounts which have managed more than 1000 transactions.","2693-9177","978-1-6654-5813-9","10.1109/QRS54544.2021.00101","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFE0105500); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9724842","fuzzing;reentrancy;smart contract;Ethereum;blockchain","Runtime;Conferences;Smart contracts;Data preprocessing;Software quality;Fuzzing;Software reliability","blockchains;contracts;program testing;software quality","smart contract development;fuzz testing;ReDefender;fuzzing input;fuzz engine;agent contract;execution log;on-chain contract accounts;malicious reentrancy vulnerabilities;runtime information;Ethereum;blockchain","","3","","18","IEEE","10 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The value of insurance coverage is obtained from an expensive and lengthy process, especially when facing an extreme weather condition such as sea storm. This adds a heavy toll on fisherman's shoulders when facing the natural conditions. To solve these problems, which is to reduce evaluation costs, blockchain-based smart contracts are used ensure easier asymmetric information. We proposed a blockchain-based smart contract framework that applies to weather-based index insurance. We chose Docker Container and Neo blockchain platform for our experiment due to its easy access tokens from neo-python with a private network. In this experiment we developed a smart contract implementation on Neo. We defined 6 (six) functions that can be triggered if certain conditions are met from an external data application program interface (API). In our experiment of blockchain implementation using Neo, we found that Neo is scalable and trusted and as well having a low memory consumption that could be running in a low specification machine.

There are various platforms implementing online vehicle booking service but the major issue with them is having a centralized authority which are pocketing huge profits. A fixed percentage of money paid by the user is taken by the centralized authority. These centralized systems also tend to misuse their user’s data and are also prone to several attacks. One of the best solutions to this problem is to use BlockChain. Our objective is to avoid this centralized authority by creating a decentralized application. Not just removing the central authority, BlockChain also provides several features like immutability, better transparency, enhanced security and traceability. Platforms like Ethereum and Hyperledger allow one to develop decentralized applications and deploy them in the blockchain. Smart Contracts can be developed using Solidity to achieve decentralization.

One of the major applications of IoT is the SG and smart meter which consists of a large number of internet-connected sensors and can communicate bi-directionally in real-time. The SG network involves smart meters, data collectors, generators, and sensors connected with the internet. SG networks involve the generation, distribution, transmission, and consumption of electrical power supplies. It consists of Household Area Network (HAN), and Neighborhood Area Network (NAN) for communication. Smart meters can communicate bidirectionally with consumers and provide real-time information to utility offices. But this communication channel is a wide-open network for data transmission. Therefore, it makes the SG network and smart meter vulnerable to outside hacker and various Cyber-Physical System (CPS) attacks such as False Data Injection (FDI), inserting malicious data, erroneous data, manipulating the sensor reading values. Here cryptography techniques can play a major role along with the private blockchain model for secure data transmission in smart meters. Hence, to overcome these existing issues and challenges in smart meter communication we have proposed a blockchain-based system model for secure communication along with a novel Advanced Elliptic Curve Cryptography Digital Signature (AECCDS) algorithm in Fog Computing (FC) environment. Here FC nodes will work as miners at the edge of smart meters for secure and real-time communication.

Among all contracts deployed in the blockchain, a vast majority will lead to little if any usage. We demonstrate that, in the course of one year, 70 % of deployed contracts lead to no use. Unfortunately, unused contracts keep occupying space on the blockchain. To tackle this issue, we propose a new protocol to identify and delete unused contracts.

It is thus an emerging yet crucial issue to effectively and efficiently detect vulnerabilities in contracts. Existing detection methods like Oyente and Securify are mainly based on symbolic execution or analysis. These methods are very time-consuming, as the symbolic execution requires the exploration of all executable paths or the analysis of dependency graphs in a contract. In this work, we propose ContractWard to detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts with machine learning techniques. First, we extract bigram features from simplified operation codes of smart contracts. Second, we employ five machine learning algorithms and two sampling algorithms to build the models. ContractWard is evaluated with 49502 real-world smart contracts running on Ethereum. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of ContractWard.

However, when customers do not get the services that they have subscribed for, it becomes a laborious job for customers to contact or visit the company and claim the correct amount of compensation or service credits. On the other hand, a Smart Contract is a contract that is a computer program that also binds multiple parties into given agreements but is a set of precise rules and is self-enforceable and self-executable. In this paper, we have introduced a novel work where we use fuzzy logic inside the Ethereum-based smart contract for two significant objectives. The first objective is to make the claim of the compensation easier and faster for customers by translating the SLA into a smart contract. The second objective is to make the smart contract even smarter and intelligent by implementing fuzzy logic so that customers who have a hard time understanding the legal jargon and ambiguities of the legal contract and SLA to find out if the compensation amount they are getting when the service is poor is good enough. Since fuzzy logic models semantics of linguistic expressions by capturing vagueness in the fuzzy sets, it becomes easier to solve the problem of contractual ambiguities and expedite the process of claiming compensation when implemented in a Blockchain-based smart contract.","","978-1-6654-1623-8","10.1109/TPSISA52974.2021.00011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9750258","Smart contract;fuzzy logic;service level agreement;SLA;ambiguity;complexity;smart legal contract;blockchain;ethereum;clauses;interpretations","Fuzzy logic;Privacy;Fuzzy sets;Law;Smart contracts;Semantics;Linguistics","blockchains;contracts;customer satisfaction;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set theory","service level agreement;SLA;legal contract;service credits;Ethereum-based smart contract;fuzzy logic models semantics;blockchain-based smart contract;fuzzy logic","","4","","26","IEEE","14 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Second, to ensure financial stability in the blockchain-enabled market and to match the difficulty of the received tasks with the ability of the workers, we design a dynamic, hierarchical pricing mechanism based on economic modeling methods and heterogeneous agent theory. With this mechanism, the market is divided dynamically into multiple levels according to the remuneration of the customers' offer and the market value of the workers' resources. Additional constraints are proposed to avoid possible malicious trading behavior from workers in the resource lending process. We prove theoretically the rationality of our model and demonstrate the dynamics of the model. We show that the market price and demand can be convergent and test the cost of executing the two smart contracts.

With the dramatic surge of the IoT, security issues have also come to the fore. Consequently, ensuring the security of the IoT communication community environment and trust between entities have become important research topics. In this paper, we design a passwordless IoT authentication mechanism, namely, T-Auth, to address these issues. The identity of a device in T-Auth is based on physical unclonable functions (PUFs), a hardware-based device fingerprint technology, which can greatly improve the security level compared to hardcoded passwords. A smart contract is a program that runs on the blockchain, which provides design flexibility and operational reliability. Our mechanism establishes a new trust architecture that enables devices to exchange information securely and reliably. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a new authentication mechanism that utilizes PUFs and combines them with blockchain to greatly improve the security and reliability of a system. Additionally, by leveraging Ethereum smart contracts, our mechanism supports cross-service group authentication.","2694-2941","978-1-7281-9441-7","10.1109/ICCWorkshops50388.2021.9473808","Ministry of Science and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9473808","Internet of Things (IoT);IoT security;physical unclonable function (PUF);blockchain;smart contract;authentication","Performance evaluation;Conferences;Smart contracts;Authentication;Blockchain;Reliability engineering;Physical unclonable function","authorisation;blockchains;computer network security;contracts;Internet of Things","system reliability;system security;information exchange;blockchain;hardcoded passwords;IoT communication community environment;PUF;physical unclonable functions;T-Auth;passwordless IoT authentication mechanism;security issues;Internet-of-Things devices;authentication mechanism;cross-service group authentication;Ethereum smart contracts;trust architecture;smart contract;security level;hardware-based device fingerprint technology","","1","","18","IEEE","9 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the performance of their models relies on the behavioral features of smart contracts to a large margin, which are extracted from the transaction records only after a contract has been running for some time. In this paper, we borrow ideas from text feature extraction from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to build a classification model based on an improved CatBoost algorithm.

However, it is not safe to assume the applicability of conventional software design strategies to Blockchain-based solutions. In this paper, we assume an untrusted SLA (service level agreement) relationship between an IoT service provider and its consumer. We adopt Hyperledger Fabric for the purpose of implementing SLA compliance assessment. We design a smart contract that takes blockchain unique features into consideration. The design particularly accounts for the MVCC (multiversion concurrency control) mechanism, which while effective for resolving the double spending problem, causes read-write conflicts when high transmission rates are experienced between the IoT application and the blockchain. Using a fire station event monitoring scenario, we describe our smart contract design and solution for conflicting transactions.

Smart contracts are the programs that get executed automatically on the Blockchain when the pre-set conditions are met. Ethereum is one of the world's largest platforms for creating decentralized applications. In Ethereum, gas (in Ether, Ethereum cryptocurrency) is used to pay miners for using their resources and running the smart contracts. It has been observed that if a smart contract is not optimized, it costs more than the required gas and therefore, the user is overcharged. Hence, optimization techniques are required to apply on smart contracts before deploying it onto the main chain. The work is broken into three modules. (1.) Designing a smart contract for storing an educational certificate on Blockchain, (2.) Writing the smart contract in Solidity using Sublime Text 3 and Remix Ethereum IDE for storing an educational certificate and then finally, (3.) Analyzing the smart contract for calculation of the gas cost which has been optimized based on the following three parameters:(a.) data types - when applied bytes32 data type is used in place of string data type, gas cost is reduced to 0.18%, (b) packaging variables into a single slot through the SOLC-using structure for packing reduces the gas cost up to the 256 bits (32 bytes) length of packed variables. Here, packed variables' length is more than 256 bits (32 bytes), hence it did not reduce the gas cost and, (c) error handling functions - no change in the cost of gas while using revert () in place of throw. So, optimization of gas cost has been considerably achieved and it can be further enhanced by increasing the number of transactions.","","978-1-7281-9951-1","10.1109/GUCON50781.2021.9573701","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9573701","Blockchain;Distributed Application;Gas;Remix Ethereum IDE;Optimization;Smart contracts;Solidity;Sublime Text","Heart;Costs;Conferences;Smart contracts;Writing;Packaging;Communications technology","blockchains;certification;contracts;cost reduction;cryptocurrencies;error handling;financial data processing;storage management","gas cost reduction;blockchain;smart contract;Ethereum cryptocurrency;educational certificate;Solidity;Sublime Text 3;Remix Ethereum IDE;error handling functions","","8","","41","IEEE","2 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Smart contracts allow the automation of tasks and business rules in a decentralized architecture (i.e., without the need for an intermediary or central authority). Platforms such as Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric support smart contracts development through a consensus mechanism such as Proof-of-Work or another criterion among the network's participating nodes. This paper explores Tendermint, a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) based consensus mechanism that has not yet been widely adopted for smart contracts platforms. We apply our devised model to the healthcare application domain, more precisely in the field of e-prescription, and our results demonstrate that smart contracts can be implemented on a BFT-based platform. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the implementation of smart contracts in a BFT-based platform such as Tendermint. We exploit this domain as there can exist some conflicting interests of profit-taking. For example, pharmacists can increase the medication dosage above the one prescribed by doctors for profit-taking. Such a scenario can occur particularly in countries where healthcare is free of charge and offered as a public service (e.g., Brazil). We show that smart contracts in BFT-based blockchain can help in solving problems in these application scenarios. Finally, our two key contributions in this paper are two-fold: (i) exploit smart-contracts in BFT-based platforms where they (smart contracts) are not very established yet in the blockchain domain; (ii) provide a smart-contract-based e-prescription solution to reduce the costs (no need for a central authority) and scams particularly in countries where the medical service is free and public.","2372-9198","978-1-6654-4121-6","10.1109/CBMS52027.2021.00037","FAPESP(grant numbers:2018/17335-9); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9474701","Smart Contracts;e-Prescription;Tendermint;BFT","Fault tolerance;Distributed ledger;Smart contracts;Fault tolerant systems;Medical services;Blockchain;Computer architecture","contracts;fault tolerant computing;health care;Internet;medical information systems","BFT-based platform;smart-contract-based e-prescription solution;decentralized e-prescription system;hyperledger fabric;electronic prescription;medical prescriptions;Ethereum fabric;Byzantine fault tolerant based consensus mechanism;healthcare application domain;profit-taking;medication dosage","","4","","27","IEEE","12 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Smart contract vulnerabilities however made them a prime target to malicious attacks that are leading to huge losses. The research community is thus applying various software engineering technologies to smart contracts to address them. In general, to detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts, mutation and fuzz based testing approaches have been widely studied and indeed achieved promising performance on benchmark datasets. Generating test inputs with mutation approaches essentially relies on the available test cases in a smart contract program. In our preliminary study, however, we observed that 56.4% of 218 identified open-source smart contract project repositories do not provide any test case for validation. Fuzzing test inputs leads to random values and lacks practical usefulness. Our work addresses this problem: we propose an approach, Smartgift, which generates practical inputs for testing smart contracts by learning from the transaction records of real-world smart contracts. Leveraging a collected set of over 60 thousand transaction records, Smartgift is able to generate relevant test inputs for ~77% smart contract functions, largely outperforming the traditional fuzzing approach (successful for only 60% functions). We further demonstrate the practicality of the test inputs by using them to replace the test inputs of the ContractFuzzer state of the art smart contract vulnerability detector: with inputs by Smartgift, ContractFuzzer can now detect 131 of the 154 vulnerabilities in its benchmark.","2576-3148","978-1-6654-2882-8","10.1109/ICSME52107.2021.00009","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1005500,2020AAA0107704); Open Project Program of the Key Laboratory of Safety-Critical Software (NUAA); Ministry of Industry and Information Technology(grant numbers:XCA20026); European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(grant numbers:949014); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9609227","Test Input Generation;Smart Contract;Deep Learning","Software maintenance;Conferences;Smart contracts;Bit error rate;Prototypes;Fuzzing;Benchmark testing","blockchains;contracts;fuzzy set theory;program testing;software engineering","mutation approaches;fuzz based testing approaches;open-source smart contract project repositories;relevant test inputs;smartgift;initial coin offerings;malicious attacks;software engineering technologies","","3","","52","IEEE","24 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unlike traditional programs, once deployed, they cannot be modified. As smart contracts carry more value, they become more of an exciting target for attackers. Over the last years, they suffered from exploits costing millions of dollars due to simple programming mistakes. As a result, a variety of tools for detecting bugs have been proposed. Most of these tools rely on symbolic execution, which may yield false positives due to over-approximation. Recently, many fuzzers have been proposed to detect bugs in smart contracts. However, these tend to be more effective in finding shallow bugs and less effective in finding bugs that lie deep in the execution, therefore achieving low code coverage and many false negatives. An alternative that has proven to achieve good results in traditional programs is hybrid fuzzing, a combination of symbolic execution and fuzzing. In this work, we study hybrid fuzzing on smart contracts and present ConFuzzius, the first hybrid fuzzer for smart contracts. ConFuzzius uses evolutionary fuzzing to exercise shallow parts of a smart contract and constraint solving to generate inputs that satisfy complex conditions that prevent evolutionary fuzzing from exploring deeper parts. Moreover, ConFuzzius leverages dynamic data dependency analysis to efficiently generate sequences of transactions that are more likely to result in contract states in which bugs may be hidden. We evaluate the effectiveness of ConFuzzius by comparing it with state-of-the-art symbolic execution tools and fuzzers for smart contracts. Our evaluation on a curated dataset of 128 contracts and a dataset of 21K real-world contracts shows that our hybrid approach detects more bugs than state-of-the-art tools (up to 23%) and that it outperforms existing tools in terms of code coverage (up to 69%). We also demonstrate that data dependency analysis can boost bug detection up to 18%.","","978-1-6654-1491-3","10.1109/EuroSP51992.2021.00018","Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR)(grant numbers:13192291); European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(grant numbers:830927); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9581164","Ethereum;smart contracts;hybrid fuzzing;data dependency analysis;genetic algorithm;symbolic execution","Codes;Costing;Smart contracts;Computer bugs;Tools;Fuzzing;Programming","contracts;program debugging;program diagnostics;security of data","dynamic data dependency analysis;evolutionary fuzzing;bugs detection;data dependency-aware hybrid fuzzer;ConFuzzius;symbolic execution tools;hybrid fuzzing;smart contracts","","4","","52","IEEE","4 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is only possible by deploying a new version of the smart contract which is costly (deployment cost for the new contract and destruction cost for the old contract). To this end, there are many solutions for testing the smart contracts before their deployment. Since realizing bug-free smart contracts increase the reliability, as well as reduce the cost, testing is an essential activity.

The proposed ecosystem consists of distributed power generation nodes, consumers, smart grids, and microgrids to make peer-to-peer energy transactions easy, both physically and economically. The proposal can be divided into two parts, viz. physical and digital. A user cannot send power to another customer in need with few exceptions in a traditional system. This work has shown how each user can be connected to the smart grid via one or many micro-grids. Moreover, their trade will be automated on the digital side by Ethereum, a public blockchain that supports smart contracts.

They have the potential to revolutionize many industries such as financial institutes and supply chains. However, smart contracts are subject to code-based vulnerabilities, which casts a shadow on its applications. As smart contracts are unpatchable (due to the immutability of blockchain), it is essential that smart contracts are guaranteed to be free of vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, smart contract languages such as Solidity are Turing-complete, which implies that verifying them statically is infeasible. Thus, alternative approaches must be developed to provide the guarantee. In this work, we develop an approach which automatically transforms smart contracts so that they are provably free of 4 common kinds of vulnerabilities. The key idea is to apply run-time verification in an efficient and provably correct manner. Experiment results with 5000 smart contracts show that our approach incurs minor run-time overhead in terms of time (i.e., 14.79%) and gas (i.e., 0.79%).","2375-1207","978-1-7281-8934-5","10.1109/SP40001.2021.00057","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9519444","smart-contracts;symbolic-execution;ethereum-evm","Industries;Privacy;Smart contracts;Supply chains;Transforms;Blockchains;Security","blockchains;contracts;program verification","vulnerable smart contract languages;blockchain network;code-based vulnerabilities;run-time verification","","3","","34","IEEE","26 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many applications of blockchains are related to the exchange of tokens, ie. valuable units that can be native, such as bitcoin and ether, or implemented in software, through smart contracts. Standards ensure token interoperability among decentralized applications of a certain platform, but they are general enough to be used in other contexts as well. A trend in blockchain is to implement such standards from a platform to another one, easing the design challenges with trusted and widely-used specifications. Exploiting the target language semantic can result in technological advantages with more efficient contracts. This paper presents a re-engineering of OpenZeppelin’s implementation of the ERC-20 standard for fungible tokens on Takamaka, a subset of Java for programming smart contracts in the Hotmoka blockchain. It starts with a literal translation from Solidity to Takamaka, but then describes a novel implementation for making snapshots of tokens, based on tree maps, that is possible in Java, but not in Solidity, and shows that it is much more efficient than the literal translation in Java from Solidity, within the Java Virtual Machine.","","978-1-6654-2182-9","10.1109/BCCA53669.2021.9657047","Regione del Veneto; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9657047","smart contract;software reengineering;blockchain;token;ERC-20","Java;Codes;Smart contracts;Semantics;Cloning;Programming;Virtual machining","contracts;cryptocurrencies;Java;open systems;programming language semantics;virtual machines","efficient snapshots;Java virtual machine;valuable units;bitcoin;ether;token interoperability;decentralized applications;target language semantic;efficient contracts;ERC-20 standard;fungible tokens;Hotmoka blockchain;literal translation;OpenZeppelin implementation;reengineering ERC-20 smart contracts","","","","18","IEEE","30 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Every user wants to secure their data from the outer world. Blockchain is the prominent technology that can provide the security and loyalty of data. Initially, blockchain has been used for the cryptocurrency and all the data were available on the public distributed ledger. But now a days, private blockchain is widely used within the organizations for data security. Blockchain engenders decentralized systems in which data can be send and receive securely and efficiently over the network. It means there is everything is hidden from the outer world; only authorized users have the authority to read and write the data on the network. World's topmost industries; like Walmart, IBM, Google, etc. are adopting the blockchain technology to build the Decentralized Applications (DApps). Decentralized Applications are the smart systems that are executed on a distributed computer network. Blockchain enables one of the most secure applications called Smart Contract. Smart Contracts are the computerized and secured distributed ledgers that enable secure, transparent, and tamper-proof transactions. Smart contracts create and verify the data with the help of hashing. It is a mathematical procedure that uses the most powerful algorithm cryptographic Hash Algorithm i.e. SHA-256. It engenders 256-bit signature for the input text. Ethereum Blockchain Platform is a widely used platform to build the DApps. This platform is a public network platform, which is open to all and anyone can participate in this network to send and receives the transactions. Blockchain Technology is enabled in every sector like marketing, business, education and supply-chain, etc. This paper carries out the study Ethereum Blockchain Platform in Education System. We have developed an application for the Online-Examination System using Blockchain Ethereum Platform with features of Smart Contracts that enables server runtime environment NodeJS and MongoDB database system. Blockchain-based system is truly more secure than all the Cloud-based systems. We have also analysed that how blockchain based online examination is more trustworthy as compare the other systems.","2329-7190","978-1-7281-5875-4","10.1109/ICCCI50826.2021.9402420","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9402420","Blockchain Technology;Smart-Contracts;Ethereum Wallet MetaMask;Remix_IDE;Node.JS;MongoDB and Ethereum","Runtime environment;Distributed ledger;Smart contracts;Education;Blockchain;Servers;Resource management","blockchains;electronic money;financial data processing","Blockchain network;outer world;public distributed ledger;private blockchain;data security;Blockchain engenders;blockchain technology;Decentralized Applications;smart systems;distributed computer network;secure applications;computerized secured distributed ledgers;Smart contracts create;public network platform;Ethereum Blockchain Platform;Education System;Online-Examination System;Blockchain Ethereum Platform;Blockchain-based system;Cloud-based systems;powerful algorithm cryptographic Hash Algorithm;Smart Contract enabled Online Examination System;storage capacity 256 bit","","5","","19","IEEE","21 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Even worse, smart contract is a tamper proof digital agreement and fixing bugs in it is difficult, so it is necessary for developers to detect security vulnerabilities in smart contract before deployment. Researchers have proposed several methods on smart contract vulnerability detection. However, despite the numerous vulnerability-finding tools, few of them have ideal detection performance because most of them rely on fixed rules, which is inefficient. In this paper, a modularized and systematic Deep Learning-based framework is proposed to automatically detect smart contracts vulnerability, called DeeSCVHunter. Particularly, we focus on two types of smart contract vulnerabilities: reentrancy and time dependence. And we propose a novel notion of Vulnerability Candidate Slice (VCS) to help models capture the key point of vulnerability. We conduct experiments on real-world dataset and the results prove the effectiveness of VCS, which leads to 25.76% improvement in F1-score at most. And extensive experiments also show that our proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.","2161-4407","978-1-6654-3900-8","10.1109/IJCNN52387.2021.9534324","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9534324","","Systematics;Smart contracts;Semantics;Neural networks;Computer bugs;Tools;Data models","contracts;deep learning (artificial intelligence);program debugging;security of data","smart contract vulnerability detection;worse contract;tamper proof digital agreement;fixing bugs;security vulnerabilities;numerous vulnerability-finding tools;ideal detection performance;smart contract vulnerabilities;vulnerability candidate slice;systematic deep learning-based framework;modularized deep learning-based framework","","6","","35","IEEE","21 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, persistence and auditability of stored data in blocks into the blockchain provide the confidence of using the correct data when needed later and adds transparency, anonymity, and traceability at the same time. To fulfill such a goal, in this article, we design a new smart contract-based blockchain-envisioned authenticated key agreement mechanism in a smart farming environment. The device-to-device (D2D) authentication phase and device-to-gateway (D2G) authentication phase support mutual authentication and key agreement between two Internet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled devices and between an IoT device and the gateway node (GWN) in the network, respectively. The blocks are created by the edge servers on the authenticated data of IoT devices received from the GWNs and then sent to the cloud server (CS). The smart contract-based consensus mechanism allows verification and addition of the formed blocks by a peer-to-peer (P2P) CSs network.

To that purpose, we define a restrained Solidity subset and a transfer function that translates Solidity contracts to Event-B models.

As these oracles are generated through algorithmic processes, they pass the standard random tests for finite and bounded intervals only. This ensures a false sense of privacy and confidentiality in exchange through open protocol IoT-stacks in public channels, i.e., Internet. Recently, blockchain (BC)-envisioned random sequences as input oracles are proposed about financial applications, and windfall games like roulette, poker, and lottery. These random inputs exhibit fairness, and nondeterminism in SC executions termed as probabilistic smart contracts (PSCs). However, the IoT-enabled PSC process might be controlled and forged through humans, machines, and bot-nodes through physical and computational methods. Moreover, dishonest entities like contract owners, players, and miners can co-ordinate together to form collusion attacks during consensus to propagate false updates, which ensures forged block additions by miners in BC. Motivated by these facts, in this article, we propose a BC-envisioned IoT-enabled PSC scheme, SaNkhyA, which is executed in three phases. In the first phase, the scheme eliminates colluding dishonest miners through the proposed miner selection algorithm. Then, in the second phase, the elected miners agree through the proposed consensus protocol to generate a stream of random bits. In the third phase, the generated random bit-stream is split through random splitters and fed as input oracles to the proposed PSC among participating entities. In simulation, the scheme ensures a trust probability of 0.38 even at 85% collusion among miners and has an average block processing delay of 1.3 s compared to serial approaches, where the block processing delay is 5.6 s, thereby exhibiting improved scalability. The overall computation and communication cost is 28.48 ms, and 101 bytes, respectively, that indicates the efficacy of the proposed scheme compared to the traditional schemes.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3072293","Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering(grant numbers:1956193); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9399657","Blockchain (BC);consensus;Internet-of-Things (IoT);probabilistic smart contracts (PSCs);random numbers","Games;Peer-to-peer computing;Ecosystems;Smart contracts;Encryption;Random sequences;Internet of Things","blockchains;contracts;cryptographic protocols;data privacy;Internet of Things;probability;random number generation;random sequences;security of data;telecommunication security","pseudonoise-diffusion oracles;data exchange;peer nodes;standard random tests;privacy;confidentiality;open protocol IoT-stacks;public channels;blockchain-envisioned random sequences;input oracles;random inputs;IoT-enabled PSC process;bot-nodes;physical methods;dishonest entities;contract owners;BC-envisioned IoT-enabled PSC scheme;dishonest miners;miner selection algorithm;elected miners;consensus protocol;generated random bit-stream;random splitters;average block processing delay;communication cost;blockchain-envisioned trusted random oracles;IoT-enabled probabilistic smart contracts;Internet-of-Things-based sensor communications;memory size 101.0 Byte;time 1.3 s;time 5.6 s;time 28.48 ms","","10","","23","IEEE","9 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

AMI defensive effectiveness depends on the honeypot deployment of the small-scale electricity suppliers (SESs) in sharing defense data. However, since the honeypot system is an additional defensive tool deployed by SESs, traditional power retailers (TPRs) cannot confirm in advance that the defense data shared by SES is valid. Therefore, it is necessary to design an incentive mechanism based on the information asymmetry to encourage SES to share defense data honestly. In this paper, we propose a honeypot deployment contract-theoretic model (HDCM) to improve the defensive effectiveness of AMI, where SES will honestly share defense data and the defense cost of TPR will be reduced. We first divide the SESs' contribution into finite types, and model the defense data sharing contract between the TPR and SESs. Then, the contract feasibility of HDCM is derived in necessary and sufficient conditions. At last, we analyze the optimal contract offered by TPR in the continuous case of SESs. Numerical simulations show that the HDCM can incentivize SESs to deploy honeypot and honestly share defense data, and make defensive effectiveness of AMI close to the information symmetry case.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2021.3071513","NSF(grant numbers:EARS-1839818,CNS1717454,CNS-1731424,CNS-1702850); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1836104,61602247,61702235,U1636117); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20160840); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:30918012204); Talent Start-Up Fund of Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology(grant numbers:1521082101007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9397770","Honeypot;contract theory;information asymmetry;industrial Internet of Things;advanced metering infrastructure%","Contracts;Security;Industrial Internet of Things;Smart grids;Tools;Game theory;Databases","contracts;incentive schemes;Internet of Things;power engineering computing;security of data;smart meters","SES;honeypot deployment contract-theoretic model;defense data sharing contract;contract-based incentive mechanisms;advanced metering infrastructure;honeypot defense deployment;AMI defensive effectiveness;industrial Internet of Things;IIoT;cyber-attack;small-scale electricity suppliers;traditional power retailer;TPR;HDCM;numerical simulation;information symmetry case;defense cost reduction","","2","","25","IEEE","7 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a novel smart contract security technology, named Jyane, to detect the Reentrancy vulnerability, which is one of the most threatening vulnerabilities to smart contracts. More importantly, Our tool-Jyane is the first path profiling solution for smart contracts. Firstly, we use EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) binary bytecode to construct control flow graphs (CFG), then use the improved Ball-Larus Path profiling algorithm (BLPP) to generate IDs for acyclic paths. Finally, after profiling the constructed paths, the suspicious paths can be detected successfully. We evaluate Jyane and other technology through comprehensive test and comparison; the results show that Jyane can profile the actual execution path of smart contracts to detect vulnerabilities with a low false-positive rate accurately. From the results of the evaluation, Jyane marked 27 of 1,226 Ethereum smart contracts selected in 2016 and 2017 as vulnerable contracts, included the vulnerability of the DAO contract which once led to a $60 million loss.

However, public blockchains exhibit their limitations on the transaction throughput, storage availability, and compute capacity. To avoid transaction gridlock, public blockchains impose large fees and per-block resource limits, making it difficult to accommodate the ever-growing high transaction demand. Previous research endeavors to improve the scalability and performance of blockchain through various technologies, such as side-chaining, sharding, secured off-chain computation, communication network optimizations, and efficient consensus protocols. However, these approaches have not attained a widespread adoption due to their inability in delivering a cloud-like performance, in terms of the scalability in transaction throughput, storage, and compute capacity. In this work, we determine that the major obstacle to public blockchain scalability is their underlying unstructured P2P networks. We further show that a centralized network can support the deployment of decentralized smart contracts. We propose a novel approach for achieving scalable decentralization: instead of trying to make blockchain scalable, we deliver decentralization to already scalable cloud by using an Ethereum smart contract. We introduce Blockumulus, a framework that can deploy decentralized cloud smart contract environments using a novel technique called overlay consensus. Through experiments, we demonstrate that Blockumulus is scalable in all three dimensions: computation, data storage, and transaction throughput. Besides eliminating the current code execution and storage restrictions, Blockumulus delivers a transaction latency between 2 and 5 seconds under normal load. Moreover, the stress test of our prototype reveals the ability to execute 20,000 simultaneous transactions under 26 seconds, which is on par with the average throughput of worldwide credit card transactions.","2575-8411","978-1-6654-4513-9","10.1109/ICDCS51616.2021.00064","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS1950171,CNS1949753,CNS2000681); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9546496","Cloud;Blockchain;Smart Contract","Cloud computing;Scalability;Smart contracts;Memory;Prototypes;Throughput;Credit cards","bank data processing;blockchains;cloud computing;cryptographic protocols;peer-to-peer computing","Blockumulus;public blockchains;decentralized transactions;transaction throughput;transaction gridlock;per-block resource limits;secured off-chain computation;communication network optimizations;cloud-like performance;public blockchain scalability;unstructured P2P networks;scalable decentralization;scalable cloud;Ethereum smart contract;decentralized cloud smart contract environments;worldwide credit card transactions;financial market;consensus protocols;data storage;code execution;storage restrictions","","5","","35","IEEE","4 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a private Ethereum-based blockchain system is proposed to ensure the traceability of donations from the time a donor gives them until the beneficiary receives them. For this, a private blockchain was created with proof of work (PoW) consensus protocol and a smart contract to develop, obtain, and send a donation to a final user. The implementation was validated using tools and expert judgment on the blockchain and the smart contract. Finally, it was demonstrated that it is feasible to implement, both technically and procedurally, a blockchain and a smart contract for the traceability of donations, since the smart contract, through its functions in the blockchain, allows the donor to track his donation until it reaches the hands of the beneficiary.","","978-1-6654-1571-2","10.1109/ICOEI51242.2021.9453016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9453016","Blockchain;Consensus Protocol;Proof of Work;Smart Contract;Traceability;Donations","Smart contracts;Blockchain;Organizations;Tools;Proof of Work;Market research;Mobile applications","blockchains;contracts;cryptocurrencies","smart contract;donation traceability;administers donations;outgoing donations;beneficiary;private Ethereum-based blockchain system;proof of work consensus protocol;incoming donations","","","","24","IEEE","21 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result, smart contracts have been targeted by cyber attackers for the purpose of cryptocurrency theft. The smart contract honeypot is a commonly used attack method. An attacker who makes a honeypot lures other weak attackers who target vulnerable contracts by seeming to have exploitable flaws. The honeypot attacker then steals cryptocurrency from the weak attackers using a hidden trap. In this paper, we propose a machine-learning model that can detect such honeypots with high performance and prevent theft before it occurs. We use a term-frequency inverse document-frequency method to extract feature words and word2vec to learn distributed representations for the Solidity bytecode. As a result, we achieved higher PR-AUC scores in honeypot detection compared with previous efforts. Based on this, we demonstrate that the smart contract code contains useful information for honeypot detection. Furthermore, our proposed method works without using features that become available after theft. Hence, the method enables us to predict incidents and reduce the number of honeypot victims.","2693-9371","978-1-6654-7836-6","10.1109/QRS-C55045.2021.00099","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9742031","Security Machine learning Data analysis Computer security","Solid modeling;Codes;Smart contracts;Time series analysis;Machine learning;Software quality;Feature extraction","computer network security;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;security of data;text analysis","machine-learning approach;Solidity bytecode;smart-contract honeypot detection;smart contracts;Ethereum blockchain network;academic domains;cyber attackers;cryptocurrency theft;smart contract honeypot;commonly used attack method;weak attackers;vulnerable contracts;honeypot attacker;machine-learning model;term-frequency inverse document-frequency method;smart contract code;honeypot victims","","2","","18","IEEE","1 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Ethereum Smart Contracts are programs that are deployed as decentralized applications, having the building blocks of the blockchain consensus protocol. This technology enables consumers to make agreements in a transparent and conflict-free environment. However, the security vulnerabilities within these smart contracts are a potential threat to the applications and their consumers and have shown in the past to cause huge financial losses. In this paper, we propose a framework that combines static and dynamic analysis to detect Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability due to an unexpected revert in Ethereum Smart Contracts. Our framework, SmartScan, statically scans smart contracts under test (SCUTs) to identify patterns that are potentially vulnerable in these SCUTs and then uses dynamic analysis to precisely confirm their exploitability of the DoS-Unexpected Revert vulnerability, thus achieving increased performance and more precise results. We evaluated SmartScan on a set of 500 smart contracts collected from the Etherscan. Our approach shows an improvement in precision and recall when compared to available state of the art techniques.","","978-1-6654-4567-2","10.1109/WETSEB52558.2021.00010","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9474789","","Runtime;Conferences;Smart contracts;Market research;Consensus protocol;Security;Portals","blockchains;contracts","Ethereum smart contracts;SmartScan;DoS-Unexpected Revert vulnerability;blockchain technology;Denial of Service vulnerability;smart contracts under test;SCUTs","","7","","23","IEEE","8 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Smart Contracts are executed by every miner in the system serially without any parallelism, both inter and intra-Smart Contracts. Such a serial execution inhibits the scalability required to obtain extremely high throughput pertaining to computationally intensive tasks deployed with such Smart Contracts. While significant advancements have been made in the field of concurrency, from GPU architectures that enable massively parallel computation to tools such as MapRe-duce that distributed computing to several nodes connected in the system to achieve higher performance in distributed systems, none are incorporated in blockchain-based distributed computing. The team proposes a novel blockchain that allows public nodes in a permission-independent blockchain to deploy and run Smart Contracts that provide concurrency-related functionalities within the Smart Contract framework. In this paper, the researchers present “ConCurrency,” a blockchain network capable of handling big data-based computations. The technique is based on currently used distributed system paradigms, such as MapReduce, while also allowing for fundamental parallelly computable problems. Concurrency is achieved using a sharding protocol incorporated with consensus mechanisms to ensure high scalability, high reliability, and better efficiency. A detailed methodology and a comprehensive analysis of the proposed blockchain further indicate a significant increase in throughput for parallelly computable tasks, as detailed in this paper.","","978-1-7281-8501-9","10.1109/ICICT50816.2021.9358622","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9358622","blockchain;MapReduce;concurrency;Big Data;distributed systems;security","Concurrent computing;Scalability;Smart contracts;Blockchain;Throughput;Task analysis;Distributed computing","Big Data;contracts;cryptocurrencies;data analysis;data handling;graphics processing units;parallel architectures;parallel processing","computationally intensive tasks;massively parallel computation;blockchain-based distributed computing;smart contract framework;big data-based computations;intra-smart contracts;Ethereum;GPU architectures;MapReduce;ConCurrency;blockchain network;parallelly computable tasks;cryptocurrencies;serial execution","","1","","16","IEEE","26 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unfortunately, a smart contract deployed on a blockchain by itself is usually inadequate in maintaining data security and privacy because the data are replicated to all the nodes on the network. There has been some recent work that tries to tackle this privacy leakage issue in smart contract execution by integrating blockchains with hardware supported trusted execution environments(TEEs). Although TEEs ensure privacy to some extent, the smart contract execution can still be compromised if the developed code does not use the TEEs' capabilities correctly. One important security issue for leveraging TEEs in practice is the memory access pattern disclosure. Even though the TEEs encrypt all the memory content during the program execution, the memory access sequence can be observed by the malicious operating system, and can be used to infer sensitive information such as “who submitted the second highest bid to the auction?”. Hence, for enhanced security for TEE based applications, the memory access pattern leakage need to be addressed. Given these observations, an apparent question that comes to light is, how can we use TEEs correctly to enable efficient, privacy enhancing and secure applications? In this work, we address this challenge in the context of digital auctions. We develop a novel generic and secure framework that allow an auction smart contract to run inside secure enclaves over Intel SGX based TEEs on a blockchain. To our knowledge, this is the first work that provides access pattern leakage free TEE based secure auction smart contract deployment. We achieve this by implementing oblivious execution (i.e., no memory access pattern leakage) of both first price and second price sealed bid auctions as templates. Furthermore, we implement an end-to-end encryption service to keep the bids secure. Our empirical results and privacy analysis show that this architecture does not cause a significant impact to efficiency given the level of security achieved.","","978-1-6654-1760-0","10.1109/Blockchain53845.2021.00069","NSF(grant numbers:CNS-1837627,OAC-1828467,IIS-1939728,DMS-1925346,CNS-2029661,OAC-2115094,W911NF-17-1-0356); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9680515","Blockchain;TEE;SGX;Auction;Security","Privacy;Data privacy;Operating systems;Conferences;Smart contracts;Hardware;Blockchains","blockchains;contracts;data privacy;electronic commerce;security of data;trusted computing","memory access sequence;TEE based applications;digital auctions;secure auction smart contract deployment;price sealed bid auctions;privacy analysis;distributed applications;data security;privacy leakage;blockchains;smart contract;trusted execution environments;Intel SGX based TEE;memory access pattern leakage;SECAUCTEE;end-to-end encryption service","","","","20","IEEE","24 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The existing work, Ethereum name service (ENS), provides a method to map human-readable names to machine-readable addresses. However, it still suffers the problems induced from the ossification of SC, such as no mechanism to call functions in a non-existing SC, to update SC, to acquire the SC information (e.g. contract application binary interface and address), and to achieve access control. To solve these problems, we propose a flexible smart contract interaction framework with access control (FSCC), where SC name and information are separately stored at blockchain and the distributed off-chain storage to reduce on-chain storage overhead. With the FSCC, interactions with non-existing SC, update of SC, and access control of SC can be achieved. Furthermore, performance evaluations show that on-chain storage overhead can be greatly reduced with keeping the communication delay at a low level.","1938-1883","978-1-7281-7122-7","10.1109/ICC42927.2021.9500960","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9500960","","Access control;Performance evaluation;Conferences;Smart contracts;Power capacitors;Blockchains;Delays","authorisation;blockchains;computer network security;performance evaluation","trust third party;in-network computation;green applications;Ethereum name service;map human-readable names;machine-readable addresses;application binary interface;address;achieve access control;flexible smart contract interaction framework;FSCC;blockchain;on-chain storage overhead;user-defined program code;immutability;auditability","","1","","16","IEEE","6 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this way data can be validated and used for tracing the health status of the EV's battery. The design of customized smart contract allows to acquire the profiles of battery usage. These data can be shared with the DSO and actors of the second life batteries market, while preserving the privacy of the car owner. The use of channels which is available in Hyperledger Fabric appears quite useful to share information only with those actors that are really interested. One smart contract writes data on a channel shared between the insurance company, the car manufacturer and the car owner.

In this paper, we propose a Multi-Modal Transformer-based (MMTrans) code summarization approach for smart contracts. Specifically, the MMTrans learns the representation of source code from the two heterogeneous modalities of the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), i.e., Structure-based Traversal (SBT) sequences and graphs. The SBT sequence provides the global semantic information of AST, while the graph convolution focuses on the local details. The MMTrans uses two encoders to extract both global and local semantic information from the two modalities respectively, and then uses a joint decoder to generate code comments. Both the encoders and the decoder employ the multi-head attention structure of the Transformer to enhance the ability to capture the long-range dependencies between code tokens. We build a dataset with over 300K <; method, comment> pairs of smart contracts, and evaluate the MMTrans on it. The experimental results demonstrate that the MMTrans outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of four evaluation metrics by a substantial margin, and can generate higher quality comments.","2643-7171","978-1-6654-1403-6","10.1109/ICPC52881.2021.00010","University of Hong Kong; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9463060","Smart Contracts;Code Summarization;Transformer;Graph Convolution;Structure-based Traversal","Measurement;Convolutional codes;Convolution;Smart contracts;Semantics;Syntactics;Maintenance engineering","contracts;data mining;formal specification;human computer interaction;program compilers;programming language semantics;public domain software;software maintenance;source code (software);source coding;trees (mathematics)","smart contracts;code comment;computer programs;source code;high-quality code comments;MMTrans;heterogeneous modalities;AST;SBT sequence;global semantic information;local semantic information;multihead attention structure;code tokens;multimodal transformer-based code summarization approach","","12","","48","IEEE","28 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed scheme achieves data confidentiality, integrity, and access control rules by implementing active entities’ access control policy written in a smart contract. Entities are first authenticated using digital signatures. Afterwards, the completion of treatment initiated the transaction and transferred the amount to the requested entities. This scheme integrates Ethereum blockchain (BCN), decentralized storage, and incentive schemes. In this scheme, smart contracts are written in solidity language and deployed on the Ethereum-based test network.

The internet of medical things (IoMT) provides a smart integrated platform for online healthcare services and securities for electronic health records. With the help of the Internet IoMT is capable of remotely monitoring, collecting, and processing patient's healthcare data without physical movement to the hospitals. However with the centralized structure of the IoT platform invites scalability, privacy, and security concerns. Blockchain is a decentralized distributed ledger technology that enables a peer-to-peer network for communication of non-trusted members around the globe. The decentralized and immutable record-keeping feature of Blockchain technology has the potential to increase the scalability, security, and privacy of healthcare data. With the powerful features of Blockchain technology in this paper, we proposed a smart contract-based novel framework named Electronic Medical Record Infrastructure (EMRI) for privacy preservation of patents information and enabling scalable and secure communication. We also outline the challenges, advantages, and future direction of this framework.","","978-1-6654-1664-1","10.1109/OCIT53463.2021.00060","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9719443","IoMT;centralized;scalability;privacy;security;distributed ledger;peer-to-peer;decentralized;immutable;Blockchain;smart contract;EMRI","Privacy;Data privacy;Scalability;Smart contracts;Medical services;Internet of Medical Things;Blockchains","blockchains;contracts;data handling;data privacy;electronic health records;health care;Internet of Things;patient monitoring;peer-to-peer computing;telemedicine","immutable record-keeping feature;Blockchain technology;smart contract-based framework;EMRI;patient information;secure communication;healthcare data transaction;Internet of Medical Things;healthcare monitoring;medical industry;smart integrated platform;online healthcare services;electronic health record security;Internet IoMT;IoT platform;privacy;security concerns;decentralized distributed ledger technology;peer-to-peer network;nontrusted members;decentralized record-keeping feature;patient healthcare data processing;scalable secure blockchain-based IoMT framework;electronic medical record infrastructure;privacy preservation;scalable communication","","4","","17","IEEE","1 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this article, we propose and develop the first tool, named GasChecker, for automatically identifying gas-inefficient code in smart contracts, and conduct the first empirical study on the prevalence of gas-inefficient code in the deployed smart contracts. More precisely, we first summarize ten gas-inefficient programming patterns and propose a new approach based on symbolic execution (SE) to detect them in the bytecode of smart contracts. To make our approach scalable to analyze millions of smart contracts, we parallelize SE by tailoring it to the MapReduce programming model, and propose a new feedback-based load balancing strategy to effectively utilize cloud resources. Extensive experiments show that GasChecker scales well with the increase of workers. The empirical study demonstrates that lots of real smart contracts contain various inefficient code.

Since the performance evaluation in Ethereum mainnet is almost impossible, and there are no formalized performance evaluation frameworks, it is hard to perform appropriate performance evaluation of Ethereum. Detail performance evaluations on Ethereum networks are essential for developing and operating DApps. In this paper, we use Hyperledger Caliper, an automated performance evaluation framework to evaluate an Ethereum private network, and the Ropsten testnet to overcome above problems. We evaluate the performance with a specific smart contract and analyze the results. Our evaluation results show that the Ethereum private network performs better than the Ropsten testnet, and the Ropsten testnet is unstable for performance evaluation.

Blockchain technology eliminates centralised trusted authorities and provides decentralised trust assessments and improved transparency and immutability for transactions. Blockchain platforms have tightly connected decentralised consensus mechanisms and distributed ledgers. However, within DApps(decentralised applications), blockchain platforms should easily communicate with other systems, including data storage systems and front-end applications. Blockchain is not for storing big data. The transactions cost is a primary concern when developing DApps for commercial use. This paper proposes a BaaS(Blockchain as a Service) architecture enriched with a loosely coupled service API(Application Programming Interface) connecting IPFS(Interplanetary File System) as the information storage and smart contracts to govern the business logic. We realised the proposed architecture for prescriptions management in a veterinary medicine case study in Ireland. The solution DApp continuously monitors the updates of prescriptions, medicine dispenses, and medicine administrations while restricting the overuse of prescription and the use of counterfeit drugs. The traceability improves the transparency of treatment activities and information retrieval for users. Moreover, the proposed architecture is easily adaptable and maintains low-cost transactions with the support of IPFS and smart contract events.","","978-1-6654-0304-7","10.1109/ISNCC52172.2021.9615670","Science Foundation Ireland; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9615670","Blockchain;Smart Contract;Interplanetary File System;Blockchain As A Service;Decentralised Applications","Drugs;Costs;File systems;Distributed ledger;Smart contracts;Computer architecture;Programming","application program interfaces;Big Data;blockchains;cloud computing;contracts;financial data processing;information retrieval;information storage;veterinary medicine","information storage;smart contracts;veterinary medicine;Ireland;DApps;medicine dispenses;medicine administrations;low-cost transactions;BaaS architecture;decentralised trust assessments;decentralised consensus mechanisms;data storage systems;front-end applications;Big Data;blockchain as a service;business logic;decentralised applications;distributed ledgers;centralised trusted authorities;interplanetary file system;application programming interface;blockchain technology;counterfeit drugs;information retrieval;IPFS;loosely coupled service API","","","","21","IEEE","25 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A notorious example of such cases are Ponzi schemes, i.e. a financial frauds that require investors to be repaid through the investments of others who have just entered the scheme. Within the Ethereum blockchain, several contracts have been identified as being Ponzi schemes. The paper proposes a machine learning model that uses textual classification techniques to recognize contracts emulating the behavior of a Ponzi scheme. Starting from a contracts dataset containing exclusively Ponzi schemes uploaded between 2016 and 2018, we built models able to properly classify Ponzi schemes contracts. We tested several models, some of which returned an overall accuracy of 99% on classification.

Most profilers collect the information with dynamic techniques, i.e., execute an instrumented version of the program with some specific input arguments to profile the measures of interest. This article presents a novel static profiling technique for Ethereum smart contracts that, using static resource analysis, is able to generate upper-bound expressions that can be used to produce profiling information about the measure of interest. Unlike traditional profiling tools, we get upper-bounds on the measures of interest expressed in terms of the input arguments or the state variables of the smart contracts. The information that can be obtained by the upper-bounds allows us to detect gas-expensive fragments of a Solidity program or to spot resource-related vulnerabilities at specific program points of the program. Moreover, in this article we propose an automatic optimization of Solidity programs which reduces their gas consumption replacing the accesses to state variables by gas-efficient accesses to local variables. We have experimentally evaluated our technique and we have detected that 6.81% of the public functions analyzed can be optimized and 1.43% are vulnerable to execute arbitrary code.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3057565","Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades (MCIU) through the Agencia Estatal de Investigación (AEI) and Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER) (EU) Project(grant numbers:RTI2018-094403-B-C31); Comunidad de Madrid (CM) Projects co-funded by the Fondos Estructurales y de Inversión Europeos (EIE Funds) of the European Union(grant numbers:S2018/TCS-4314,S2018/TCS-4339); Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM)(grant numbers:CT27/16-CT28/16); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9348894","Blockchain;Ethereum;resource analysis;smart contracts;static analysis","Smart contracts;Tools;Optimization;Blockchain;Instruments;Static analysis;Analytical models","blockchains;contracts;optimisation;program diagnostics;resource allocation","static resource analysis;upper-bound expressions;resource-related vulnerabilities;static profiling technique;input arguments;gas consumption reduction;gas-efficient access;ethereum smart contract state variables;Solidity program optimization","","5","","39","CCBY","5 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To tackle those problems, we propose a de-swinging scheme based on the smart contract for location privacy protection. Primarily, a de-swinging reputation evaluation method (DREM) is introduced, in which participants prefer to choose nodes with high reputations to complete the construction process of the anonymous domain. In this method, we design a penalty factor to curb malicious behavior. Besides, based on our proposed DREM, a cridible cloaking area is constructed to protect the location privacy of the request nodes.

The trend in regard of people's mobility is moving from privately owned vehicles towards shared mobility. This trend is even stronger in urban areas, where space for parking is limited, and the mobility is supported by the public transport system, which lowers the need for private vehicles. Several challenges and barriers of currently available solutions retard a massive growth of this mobility option, such as the trust problem, data monopolism, or intermediary costs. Decentralizing mobility management is a promising approach to solve the current problems of the mobility market, allowing to move towards a more usable internet of mobility and smart transportation. Leveraging blockchain technology allows to cut intermediary costs, by utilizing smart contracts. Important in this ecosystem is the proof of identity of participants in the blockchain network. To proof the possession of the claimed identity, the private key corresponding to the wallet address is utilized, and therefore essential to protect. In this paper, a blockchain-based shared mobility platform is proposed and a proof-of-concept is shown. First, current problems and state-of-the-art systems are analyzed. Then, a decentralized concept is built based on ERC-721 tokens, implemented in a smart contract, and augmented with a Hardware Security Module (HSM) to protect the confidential key material. Finally, the system is evaluated and compared against state-of-the-art solutions.","","978-1-7281-8621-4","10.1109/CSP51677.2021.9357605","ECSEL Joint Undertaking(grant numbers:826610); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9357605","shared mobility;blockchain;smart contract;Ethereum;token;ERC-721;HSM","Space vehicles;Privacy;Smart cities;Smart contracts;Blockchain;Market research;Smart transportation","blockchains;computer network security;mobile computing;mobility management (mobile radio);public transport;smart cities;traffic engineering computing;trusted computing","smart contract;ERC-721 tokens;blockchain-based shared mobility platform;commercial vehicles;smart cities;urban areas;public transport system;trust problem;smart transportation;people mobility;shared mobility;velink;parking space;data monopolism;Internet of mobility;smart contracts;decentralized mobility management;hardware security module;HSM","","6","","13","IEEE","25 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

More specifically, they are based on the use of type placeholders in order to produce parametrized code, that can be instantiated for each concrete type provided for them. In many programming languages, such as Java, they are implemented by erasure, ie. replaced by their upper bound type during compilation into bytecode. This paper originated from a real security issue that we found while using generics for writing smart contracts for blockchain, in order to implement a contract for shared entities (such as a company shared by its shareholders), for the Hotmoka blockchain, whose contracts are written in Java. The considered case study is particularly important since the validators’ set of the blockchain itself is a special case of shared entities. The analysis shows that the power of generics comes at the risk of a too permissive typing of the compiled code, due to the erasure mechanism, with a consequent possible attack to the validators’ set. This paper proposes a solution that forces the compiler to generate more precise type information than those arising by erasure.","","978-1-6654-2182-9","10.1109/BCCA53669.2021.9657048","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9657048","smart contract;generics;blockchain","Computer languages;Java;Codes;Upper bound;Instruments;Smart contracts;Writing","blockchains;computer crime;contracts;Java;program compilers;programming languages;source code (software);type theory","generic smart contracts;programming languages;reusable code;parametrized code;Java;security issue;shared entities;Hotmoka blockchain;compiled code;validators set","","2","","27","IEEE","30 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are still many problems with this over-centralized authority, such as data tamper, data leakage and so on. In response to the above problems, we designed and implemented a service recommendation system based on smart contracts and DIKW (Data, Information, Knowledge and Wisdom). The system data is stored in the blockchain, which effectively prevents data from being tampered.

Smart homes can interact with the grid to perform vertical transactions, e.g., feeding in extra solar energy to the grid and providing demand response service to alleviate the grid load. Smart homes can also interact with peer users to perform horizontal transactions, e.g., peer-to-peer energy trading. However, conventional TEM method suffers from the drawbacks of low efficiency, privacy leakage, and single-point failure. To address these challenges, we develop a privacy-preserving distributed algorithm that enables users to optimally manage their energy usages in parallel via the smart contract on the blockchain. Further, we design an efficient blockchain system tailored for IoT devices and develop the smart contract to support the holistic TEM system. Finally, we evaluate the feasibility and performance of the blockchain-based TEM system through extensive simulations and experiments.

To express and enforce protocols, Nomos is based on shared binary session types. To control resource usage, Nomos employs automatic amortized resource analysis. To prevent the duplication or deletion of assets, Nomos uses a linear type system. A monad integrates the effectful session-typed language with a general-purpose functional language. Nomos' prototype implementation features linear-time type checking and efficient type reconstruction that includes automatic inference of resource bounds via off-the-shelf linear optimization. The effectiveness of the language is evaluated with case studies on implementing common smart contracts such as auctions, elections, and currencies. Nomos is completely formalized, including the type system, a cost semantics, and a transactional semantics to deploy Nomos contracts on a blockchain.

By implementing decentralization, we aim to solve security related issues in existing centralized applications. We have implemented an e-auction methodology on top of Ethereum Blockchain. The proposed application allows bidders to directly bid the products over the Internet. The blockchain technology with low transaction cost is used to develop the smart contract of public bid and sealed bid.","","978-1-6654-0610-9","10.1109/CSITSS54238.2021.9682892","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9682892","E-auction;public bid;Blockchain;smart contract","Supply chains;Sociology;Smart contracts;Blockchains;Peer-to-peer computing;Automobiles;Security","automobiles;blockchains;contracts;data privacy;electronic commerce;electronic money;financial data processing;Internet;peer-to-peer computing;pricing;tendering;transaction processing","blockchain technology;transaction records;peer-to-peer network;money transactions;information technology;second hand cars;cars segment;centralized applications;Ethereum Blockchain;transaction cost;decentralized used cars bidding application;decentralize ledger;central authority;trade settlement;transparency;cryptocurrency;security related issues;e-auction;Internet;smart contract;public bid;sealed bid","","1","","10","IEEE","25 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the smart contract applications is the issuance of digital assets, so-called tokens, serving as fundraising fuel for Initial Coin Offerings. ICOs bring a new easy, and bureaucracyless way for startups to raise considerable funds from crowds with incredible speed. However, the technology hides a dark side in the form of speculative scams, hardly distinguishable from genuine fundraising activities.

However, smart contracts lack flexibility and interfere with the autonomy of the parties concerned. We propose Hercule, an approach for declaratively specifying blockchain applications in a manner that reflects business contracts. Hercule represents a contract via regulatory norms that capture the involved parties’ expectations of one another. It computes the states of norms (hence, of contracts) from events in the blockchain. Hercule’s novelty and significance lie in that it operationalizes declarative contracts over semistructured databases, the underlying representation for practical blockchain such as Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum. Specifically, it exploits the map–reduce capabilities of such stores to compute norm states. We demonstrate that our implementation over Hyperledger Fabric can process thousands of events per second, sufficient for many applications.","1941-0131","","10.1109/MIC.2021.3080982","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:IIS-1908374); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/N027965/1); IBM; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9432720","Blockchain;Contract;Regulatory norm;Document store","Blockchain;History;Smart contracts;Distributed ledger;Law;Authorization","blockchains;contracts;inference mechanisms","Hercule;declarative contracts;business contracts;smart contracts;blockchain applications;regulatory norms;reasoning","","2","","18","IEEE","17 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

This manuscript puts forward a Constrained Hardware Device enhanced with several software elements related to blockchain and cloud infrastructures, which make possible for any electricity generator or storage system to perform major actions like executing smart contracts, requesting energy prices to a Transmission System Operator and replicating the interchanged data in a cloud computing environment in case there are blockchain node failures. In this way, Renewable Energy Sources can be integrated by means of inexpensive, reliable devices with all the required software components preinstalled, with prosumers being able to further intervene in energy markets.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3081932","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9435340","Blockchain;smart contract;energy;Internet of Things","Smart contracts;Hardware;Blockchain;Cloud computing;Distributed databases;Peer-to-peer computing;Batteries","cloud computing;contracts;Internet;Internet of Things;power generation economics;power grids;power markets;pricing;renewable energy sources","Hardware solutions;peer-to-peer electricity trading operations;power grid;equal terms;traditional players;Constrained Hardware Device;cloud infrastructure;electricity generator;energy prices;Transmission System Operator;cloud computing environment;blockchain node failures;Renewable Energy Sources;inexpensive devices;reliable devices;energy markets;towards blockchain-based internet;Energy smart contracts;Constrained Hardware devices","","1","","47","CCBY","19 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The interest around blockchain has brought to the definition of several blockchain platforms facilitating their development and application. Thus, to choose the blockchain platform that is more suitable to support a specific business need is a strategic problem.

Blockchain alleviates the problem of data access and privacy but the task of developing an SCM solution over a blockchain from scratch is challenging, complex, and time-consuming. In this paper, we present our Nocode Development Platform (NCDP) that allows users to build customized SCM applications using a user-friendly interface. Once a customized supply chain is built, our platform autogenerates and deploys the smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, thus easing the deployment of an SCM solution on the blockchain. A product can be tracked at any point in the supply chain using different tracking mechanisms. Our platform leverages the blockchain concept to provide supply chain data transparency in a secure manner to diverse stakeholders in a decentralized ecosystem. Our platform significantly reduces the time and investment to migrate existing SCM systems on the blockchain.","","978-1-86043-557-7","10.23919/ICAC50006.2021.9594235","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9594235","supply chain management;Blockchain;No-code development platform;auto-generation;smart contract","Lead acid batteries;Data privacy;Supply chain management;Supply chains;Smart contracts;Memory;Blockchains","blockchains;contracts;production engineering computing;software engineering;supply chain management","smart contract;Ethereum blockchain;blockchain;supply chain data transparency;SCM systems;NCDP;supply chain management;customer demand;Nocode Development Platform","","","","15","","15 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, information on the blockchain is open, which may cause data leakage and privacy issues. To tackle the data transparency issue, a commitment scheme is leveraged for data submission among workers. Then, an unbiased random selection algorithm is further designed to select independent workers from the dispersed worker pool to avoid possible collusion.

Secondly, a vehicular blockchain is established for the publish/subscribe system to record the transactions between brokers and publishers/subscribers to guarantee the complete and safe implementation of the smart contracts. Next, a contract based on the principal-agent problem is designed between the publisher and broker to maximize their utilities and stimulate the broker to be more active in the contents subscribing service. Furthermore, a smart contract is also designed between the subscriber and broker by the cloud server to achieve higher utilities and match an appropriate broker for the subscriber by considering its type.

The smart home uses one such transformation of IoT, which seems to be the wave of the future. However, with the increasing wide adoption of IoT, data security, and privacy concerns about how our data is collected and shared with others, has also risen. To solve these challenges, an approach to data privacy and security in a smart home using blockchain technology is proposed in this paper. We propose authentication scheme that combines attribute-based access control with smart contracts and edge computing to create a secure framework for IoT devices in smart home systems. The edge server adds scalability to the system by offloading heavy processing activities and using a differential privacy method to aggregate data to the cloud securely and privately. We present several aspects of testing and implementing smart contracts, the differential private stochastic gradient descent algorithm, and system architecture and design. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed system by fully examining its security and privacy goals in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Our framework achieves desired security and privacy goals and is resilient against modification, DoS attacks, data mining and linkage attacks.

Because smart contracts source code might not be available, static analysis approaches mostly face the challenge of analysing compiled Ethereum bytecode, that is available directly from the official blockchain. However, due to the intrinsic complexity of Ethereum bytecode (especially in jump resolution), static analysis encounters significant obstacles that reduce the accuracy of exiting automated tools. This paper presents a novel static analysis algorithm based on the symbolic execution of the Ethereum operand stack that allows us to resolve jumps in Ethereum bytecode and to construct an accurate control-flow graph (CFG) of the compiled smart contracts. EtherSolve is a prototype implementation of our approach. Experimental results on a significant set of real world Ethereum smart contracts show that EtherSolve improves the accuracy of the execrated CFGs with respect to the state of the art available approaches. Many static analysis techniques are based on the CFG representation of the code and would therefore benefit from the accurate extraction of the CFG. For example, we implemented a simple extension of EtherSolve that allows to detect instances of the re-entrancy vulnerability.","2643-7171","978-1-6654-1403-6","10.1109/ICPC52881.2021.00021","Dipartimenti di Eccellenza; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9462980","Reverse engineering;Static analysis;Smart contract;Ethereum","Smart contracts;Prototypes;Static analysis;Blockchain;Detectors;Tools;Complexity theory","blockchains;contracts;flow graphs;Java;program diagnostics","official blockchain;static analysis algorithm;Ethereum operand stack;accurate control-flow graph;compiled smart contracts;EtherSolve;Ethereum smart contracts;static analysis techniques;security problems;substantial financial value;smart contracts source code;compiled Ethereum bytecode","","1","","42","IEEE","28 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On the contrary, cryptocurrencies based on blockchains avoid many problems of the centralized platforms. However, the intrinsic anonymity makes it difficult to trace the identities if someone defaults on a transaction. To address this issue, we proposed a blockchain trading prototype based on regulatable two-tier identities in our previous work. Users can make off-chain promises about transactions through an off-chain transaction confirmation protocol and appeal to the on-chain supervision contract for reimbursement if the proof of the default is provided to the contract. The model has both anonymity and regulatability but how the proof is constructed is not designed in the previous work. In this paper, we propose a logistics proof chain based on blockchains to log the delivery information of the goods. If the goods do not arrive as expected, customers can lodge appeals to the supervision contract with a proof chain created by this logistics proof blockchain. Blockchains, smart contracts and other technologies can ensure logistics information is completely logged, and the proof chain is correctly constructed.","","978-1-6654-2063-1","10.1109/ICCSMT54525.2021.00036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9786996","blockchain;smart contract;P2P trading;logistics;regulatability","Computer science;Data privacy;Smart contracts;Prototypes;Blockchains;Cryptocurrency;Servers","blockchains;contracts;data privacy;electronic money;Internet;logistics","decentralized trading model;two-tier identities;online trading platforms;user data;user privacy;centralized platforms;intrinsic anonymity;blockchain trading prototype;off-chain transaction confirmation protocol;on-chain supervision contract;regulatability;logistics proof blockchain;logistics information","","","","8","IEEE","8 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The patient monitoring system is a big challenge and other security threats arises as the health care data transferred from one to another and authorization to create and read transactions, is a major concern related to data loss. The data loss of the patient protected health information which are generated from the devices should be handled carefully. So in this paper we proposed a solidity based smart contract run over a Ethereum virtual machine to facilitate the secure analysis and storing of transactions from and to the sensors. Using the Ethereum protocol, based on a private blockchain and writing the smart contracts to keep track of the patient health information. We have created an automatic system through which the sensors collects the data, then communicates with the decentralized application via the smart contract.

This great concern let to the proposal of the application of blockchain technology to the smart grid. Blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography and its transactions are validated by a consensus mechanism. The most known and trusted blockchain consensus mechanism is the proof-of-work (PoW) as it can process very little number of transactions per second. However, the proof-of-authority (PoA) consensus mechanism is scalable as it can process thousands of transactions per second without compromising security. This paper focuses on the applicability of blockchain PoA consensus mechanism and how it ensures that transactions are confirmed on time and the integrity of the transactions are upheld in the blockchain. The PoA consensus mechanism is appropriate especially with the adoption of peer-to-peer energy trading between prosumers and consumers. This study proposes a peer-to-peer energy trading in an open blockchain with the help of the Advanced Metering Infrastructure(AMI) that enables smart meters to function optimally for this purpose.","2575-2693","978-1-6654-4094-3","10.1109/SEGE52446.2021.9534994","Power Systems Engineering Research Center; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9534994","Proof-of-authority (PoA);vehicle-to-grid (V2G);prosumer;smart contract;advanced metering infrastructure (AMI);renewable energy certificate (REC)","Scalability;Conferences;Government;Authentication;Smart meters;Blockchains;Smart grids","blockchains;metering;power engineering computing;power markets;power system security;smart meters;smart power grids","smart grid;blockchain technology;blockchain consensus mechanism;proof-of-work;proof-of-authority consensus mechanism;PoA consensus mechanism;peer-to-peer energy trading;open blockchain;smart meters;power system security;cryptography;advanced metering infrastructure","","1","","31","IEEE","13 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, as the number of users continues to increase, privacy data leakage has become more and more serious. Also, the current model checking methods do not involve verifying the privacy data in smart contracts. For these reasons, we introduce a privacy-preserving framework based on stochastic model checking called VeriPrivData. It formally expresses privacy data by data sensitivity. The smart contract is defined as the Commitments tuple with data sensitivity. Then the Commitments tuple is used to model as DTMC (Discrete Time Markov Chains). We extend PCTL (Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic) to ds-PCTL (Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic with data sensitivity) for describing the privacy requirements. Finally, we verify whether DTMC satisfies the ds-PCTL formula. In this paper, the VeriPrivData framework uses the stochastic model checking tool PRISM, and experiments are carried out. Experimental results show that this method can effectively avoid illegal disclosure of privacy data and enhance the protection of privacy data in the contract.","2324-9013","978-1-6654-1658-0","10.1109/TrustCom53373.2021.00075","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61303022); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9724380","smart contracts;privacy data;data sensitivity;DTMC;stochastic model checking","Data privacy;Sensitivity;Conferences;Computational modeling;Smart contracts;Model checking;Markov processes","data privacy;formal verification;Markov processes;probabilistic logic;temporal logic;trees (mathematics)","privacy-preserving framework;smart contract;privacy data leakage;current model checking methods;data sensitivity;Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic;privacy requirements;stochastic model checking tool PRISM","","","","39","IEEE","9 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing centralized methods suffer from single-point-of-failure, low scalability, and high computational overhead. In addition, in these methods, users pay for the service provider as well as the network provider independently for a specific service, imposing extra cost for the user. New business models are needed to resolve such shortcomings. The realization of these models calls for sophisticated access control methods which consider the requirements of all parties who want to: 1) access a service; 2) provide that service; and 3) provide the network connection. Blockchain is an enabling technology that provides unprecedented opportunities to novel distributed access control methods for new business models. We propose an Attribute-based access control solution by leveraging Blockchain to share network providers’ and service providers’ resources. Our solution offers access flexibility based on the requirements of the parties while fulfilling reliability, accountability, and immutability. Besides, it decreases the overall service cost which is beneficial for each party. Our solution makes it possible for service providers to outsource their access control procedures without requiring a trusted third party.

On the other hand, Service Provisioning (SP) systems (i.e., systems that assign users to service providers in a way that maximizes the global utility) have been leveraging SCs to provide trust and transparency features. Such features are obtained by deploying the SP’s assignment criteria as an SC on the blockchain. However, deploying optimal assignment criteria as SCs does not guarantee the best performance over time since the blockchain participants join and leave flexibly, and their load varies with time, potentially deeming the initial assignment sub-optimal. Furthermore, modifying the criteria manually by a third party at every variation in the blockchain jeopardizes the autonomous and independent execution promised by SCs. Thus, in this paper, we propose the use of online learning SCs that leverage the chained data to continuously self-tune their assignment criteria and maintain maximum utility. We show that the proposed data-driven method can achieve high performance on the multi-stage assignment problem. We also compare the proposed approach to multiple assignment algorithms as well as planning methods. Results show a significant performance advantage over heuristics and better adaptability to the dynamic nature of blockchain networks compared to planning techniques.","1938-1883","978-1-7281-7122-7","10.1109/ICC42927.2021.9500372","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9500372","Blockchain;Smart contracts;Reinforcement learning;Service provisioning;Distributed ledger","Runtime;Heuristic algorithms;Conferences;Smart contracts;Organizations;Minimization;Software","blockchains;contracts;formal verification;learning (artificial intelligence)","rational contracts;data-driven service provisioning;blockchain-powered systems;smart contracts;software programs;blockchain platforms;decentralized execution;verifiable execution;autonomous execution;independent execution;data-driven method;multistage assignment problem;multiple assignment algorithms;blockchain networks;service provisioning systems;online learning","","","","17","IEEE","6 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Around the world, shipping documents are still prepared and processed mainly in old paper style. This result processes happening within shipping ports to be highly paper-dependent and time-consuming. As it involves multiple participants with opposing interests, shipping documents are easily vulnerable to paperwork manipulation. Blockchain technology provides a distributed, shared, and append-only ledger in which new records are added through consensus among participants invoked by smart contracts. This paper is the application of smart contracts in shipping port processes to digitize and automate paperwork filings. Smart contracts are written inspired by the shipping ports processes and deployed into Ganache private blockchain thus incorporating immutable nature, trust, decentralization and privacy of the blockchain into the entire shipment process.

Since D2D communications are fundamentally limited by their localized communication, a smart contract based approach is presented here to open up the D2D layers in B5G networks to any content provider or network operator participating in the shared blockchain network. In this work, three different priority models are evaluated for performance with respect to caching decisions driven by a genetic algorithm based search for decision optimality.

This paper proposed an outline driven framework to extract hierarchical clauses from multimodal electronic contracts by com-bining rules summarized by experts and deep learning methods to continuously discover and improve the rule base. In our approach, conflicts of outlines can be solved globally by combining basic outline rules, outline sequence sorting, an entropy based outline sequence filtering and a global fault tolerance strat-egy.

However, VEC faces several critical challenges such as the potential security issues caused by untrusted and opaque environment and the lack of incentive mechanism under asymmetric information scenario. To solve the above challenges, we propose a consortium blockchain for secure resource sharing in VEC. We first design multi-step smart contracts to achieve secure resource sharing and defend against the malicious behaviours of service requesters and vehicles with selfish purposes. Then, a byzantine fault tolerance-based proof-of-stake (BFT-based PoS) consensus protocol is applied in consortium blockchain to reach consensus efficiently. Furthermore, we design a contract-based incentive mechanism to motivate vehicles to share their computation resources with service requesters. The optimal contracts are derived to maximize the service requesters' expected utility as well as social welfare. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed incentive mechanism is more effective and efficient than the traditional schemes.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2020.3004475","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971148); Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi Province(grant numbers:2018GXNSFDA281013); Foundation for Science and Technology Project of Guilin City(grant numbers:20190214-3); Marie Sklodowska-Curie(grant numbers:824019); Sichuan Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:2019YFH0033); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9123565","Consortium blockchain;contract-based incentive mechanism;resource sharing;vehicular edge computing.","Blockchain;Resource management;Task analysis;Edge computing;Delays;Security;Contracts","blockchains;contracts;distributed processing;fault tolerant computing;pedestrians;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","vehicular edge computing;VEC;vehicular networks;computation resources;potential security issues;consortium blockchain;secure resource sharing;design multistep smart contracts;service requesters;contract based incentive mechanism;contract based approach;byzantine fault tolerance based proof of stake","","24","","36","IEEE","23 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Isshiki et al. proposed an identity management system based on group signatures in which a service provider anonymously determines whether or not users of the service are legitimate members, and only a bill collector can identify users for the purposes of sending them invoices. It is particularly worth noting that, under the Isshiki system, the service provider is not required to manage personal information such as user lists, which allows the system to outperform other in terms of preserving user privacy and managing personal information leakage risk. It is also noteworthy that the Isshiki system only considers cases in which the bill collector identifies users who have used the service and that, in fact, identified users who ignore invoices can use the service for free. In this paper, we extended the Isshiki system by adding a smart contract-enabled enforcement bill collection functionality. Under this functionality, deposits made by users who do not pay a service fee are automatically transferred to the bill collector. Because of their centralized structure, group signatures are not suitable to blockchain systems, therefore, the proposed system employs accountable ring signatures as building blocks. The privacy-preserving enforced bill collection system is implemented using the accountable ring signature scheme developed by Bootle et al. and Ethereum smart contracts. To reduce the gas costs associated with running smart contracts, the smart contract is not run unless the user ignores an invoice, and basic procedures are run via an off-chain channel. To avoid the use of heavy cryptographic algorithms in carrying out the accountable ring signature scheme for running smart contracts, we employed standard elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) signatures without especially changing the state to be verified in smart contracts.","2765-9712","978-1-6654-1788-4","10.1109/AsiaJCIS53848.2021.00018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9546901","","Structural rings;Privacy;Costs;Elliptic curves;Smart contracts;Information security;Blockchains","blockchains;data privacy;digital signatures;electronic money","user lists;user privacy;Isshiki system;smart contract-enabled enforcement bill collection functionality;group signatures;privacy-preserving enforced bill collection system;accountable ring signature scheme;Ethereum smart contracts;standard elliptic curve digital signature algorithm signatures;identity management system;personal information leakage risk management","","3","","51","IEEE","27 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Blockchains are key enablers of RETS, by virtue of providing a decentralized, self-governed network that mitigates concerns regarding privacy and transparency. However, more real-world case studies are needed to evaluate the techno-economic viability of blockchain-based RETS to improve their positive uptake. Thus, this article develops a permissioned blockchain-based RETS, which enables homeowners to select bidding strategies that consider the individual preferences of their DERs, and further evaluates the impact of the bidding strategies on reducing the peak demand of the community. The proposed system is implemented on the permissioned Hyperledger Fabric platform, where a decentralized ledger is used to store all energy bids, and a smart contract is used to execute a double auction mechanism and dispatch the homeowner DERs. The proposed system is validated by conducting simulations on a 8-home community using real-world data, and also by deploying the system to a Canadian microgrid, where the smart contract execution time is benchmarked. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed system by achieving a peak demand reduction of up to 48 kW (62%), which leads to an average savings of $1.02 M for the distribution system operator by avoiding transformer upgrades. Also, the simulation results show that the execution time of the proposed smart contract is 17.12 seconds across 12 nodes, which is sufficient for RETS.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3047885","MEARIE Group and Natural Resources Canada for providing funding and logistical support for this work; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9311198","Blockchain;energy trading;microgrid;distributed energy resources;smart contract;smart home;transactive energy","Blockchain;Peer-to-peer computing;Smart contracts;Benchmark testing;Smart homes;Schedules;Scalability","contracts;data privacy;demand side management;distributed power generation;electronic commerce;energy conservation;power markets;power system economics","permissioned blockchain system;residential communities;real-world case study;residential energy trading systems;homeowners;distributed energy resources;virtualized energy markets;blockchains;self-governed network;mitigates concerns;techno-economic viability;permissioned blockchain-based RETS;bidding strategies;permissioned Hyperledger Fabric platform;decentralized ledger;energy bids;homeowner DERs;8-home community;real-world data;smart contract execution time;peak demand reduction;distribution system operator;power 48.0 kW","","14","","52","CCBY","30 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

On the other hand, lack of transparency in DNNs makes them unreliable. To ensure transparency in DNN models, it's necessary that model validators can verify the entire learning process and convince third parties with limited resource that the given model is correctly generated. For this purpose, we propose a smart contract that is based on the dispute resolution protocol for verifying DNN model generation process. We divide the entire learning process into layer-based computations. The necessary data for validating each computation, such as the outputs of neurons, weights between layers and their gradients, are uniquely determined by the one-way hash function and the hashes are combined by multiple structured Merkle trees. This enables an honest validator to make a proof that asserts the target model is incorrectly generated, and third parties can check whether the assertion is true by only performing the given computation. Finally, to reveal how our proposal affects the performance degradation during the training, we evaluated running time for deep learning that enables our proofs. This result shows that our proposal can be applied into real applications.

The search for a vaccine against the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 illustrates this situation. The scientific credibility of findings from several vaccines’ clinical trials contributed to distorted perceptions concerning the benefits and risks of the drug. This scenario is ideal for applying technologies such as Blockchain and Smart Contracts in healthcare issues. This paper proposes a protocol based on Smart Contracts, named VaccSC, to enable transparency, accounting, and confidentiality to Phase III of vaccine experiments.

This transaction of locally generated energy is called Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading. For P2P energy trading, a community system is widely endorsed but causes an increase in overall system cost as both prosumer and consumer need to pay charges to the community manager. In this context, a hybrid P2P energy trading market is implemented through a decentralized blockchain-based mechanism. It permits market participants to trade energy directly without involving an additional entity. Contracts play a crucial role in blockchain-based energy trading mechanisms. Thus, smart contracts are designed for the efficient implementation of this trading mechanism. These contracts are designed using the Solidity platform on REMIX IDE. Prosumer and consumer interact among themselves through the main smart contract to execute P2P energy trading till market-clearing time. Afterwards, they interact with the grid through Peer-to-Grid (P2G) smart contracts for additional sell/purchase of energy.

On the one hand, blockchain remains a pastime for people interested in digital currencies or decentralized, anonymous environments such as auctions or voting. On the other hand, cyberattacks are also not an exception to the blockchain community. Most of those attacks were made through smart contracts - pieces of code through which blockchain users interact with the actual blockchain. This paper analyses the background of blockchain technology, the implementation of smart contracts, and the cybersecurity aspect in the blockchain field. We describe an in-depth analysis of five static analysis tools (or code verifiers), their capabilities and drawbacks. These are tested with smart contracts with vulnerabilities deliberately included in their source code. The vulnerabilities are tailored so that they fit into the cybersecurity properties. After the implementation process, analysis is presented. We have found out which state-of-the-art static analysis tool is the most appropriate to secure the smart contract code from future cyberattacks on the blockchain.","2324-7894","978-1-6654-4311-1","10.1109/SBESC53686.2021.9628229","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9628229","Blockchain;Cybersecurity;Static Analysis;Software Verification","Codes;Online banking;Smart contracts;Static analysis;Tools;Systems engineering and theory;Software systems","blockchains;computer crime;contracts;program diagnostics;program verification;source code (software)","code verifiers;source code;static analysis tool;security vulnerabilities;digital currencies;anonymous environments;smart contracts;blockchain technology;cybersecurity;decentralized environments;cyberattacks","","2","","35","IEEE","6 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Multiple buildings, i.e., primary building(s) (with solar & storage) and secondary building(s) (ordinary building dependent entirely on the grid), have bilateral contracts with each other, resulting in an optimized exchange bilaterally and with the grid to reduce grid costs. Further, the allowance of electric vehicles (EVs) in these buildings enable added options to optimize the power flows, focusing on cost reduction. In this work, a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) is formulated to maximize the primary building's profits, along with the financial gains to secondary buildings and a fleet of EVs. The charging infrastructure at the primary building also facilitates the EVs' load by accounting for factors such as feeder time-of-use (TOU) tariffs, contracted rates between the buildings, and EV charging prices. Results for actual load profiles for buildings in Auckland, New Zealand show that primary buildings earn up to 87 % of daily profits along with the 10–41 % daily cost savings for secondary buildings. The insights presented in this work can benefit local aggregators with options to maximize local profits lowering the grid dependence.","","978-1-6654-4875-8","10.1109/ISGTEurope52324.2021.9640116","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9640116","Energy Storage System;Electric Vehicles;Mixed Integer Linear Programming;Buildings;Bilateral Contracts","Photovoltaic systems;Renewable energy sources;Costs;Buildings;Europe;Tariffs;Smart grids","building management systems;cost reduction;distributed power generation;electric vehicle charging;energy storage;integer programming;linear programming;load flow;optimisation;power generation dispatch;power generation economics;power grids;power markets;profitability;renewable energy sources;solar power stations;tariffs","multiple buildings;primary building;bilateral contracts;optimized exchange;grid cost reduction;electric vehicles;optimized power dispatch;solar-storage system;renewable energy resources;energy storage systems;EVs;power flows;mixed-integer linear program;MILP;financial gains;charging infrastructure;feeder time-of-use tariffs;TOU;EV charging prices;Auckland;New Zealand;daily cost savings;local aggregators","","3","","15","IEEE","21 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We live in a digital, cloud era wherein the underlying information architectures are expected to be elastic, secure, resilient, and handle petabyte scaling. The expectation of epic proportions from the next generation of the data frameworks is to not only do all of the above but also build it on a foundation of trust and explainability across multi-organization business networks. From cloud providers to automobile industries or even vaccine manufacturers, components are often sourced by a complex, not full digitized thread of disjoint suppliers. Building Machine Learning and AI-based order fulfillment and predictive models, remediating issues, is a challenge for multi-organization supply chain automation. We posit that Federated Learning in conjunction with blockchain and smart contracts are technologies primed to tackle data privacy and centralization challenges. In this paper, motivated by challenges in the industry, we propose a decentralized distributed system in conjunction with a recommendation system model (Matrix Factorization) that is trained using Federated Learning on an Ethereum blockchain network. We leverage smart contracts that allow decentralized serverless aggregation to update local-ized items vectors. Furthermore, we utilize Homomorphic Encryption (HE) to allow sharing the encrypted gradients over the network while maintaining their privacy. Based on our results, we argue that training a model over a serverless Blockchain network using smart contracts will provide the same accuracy as in a centralized model while maintaining our serverless model privacy and reducing the overhead communication to a central server. Finally, we assert such a system that provides transparency, audit-ready and deep insights into supply chain operations for enterprise cloud customers resulting in cost savings and higher Quality of Service (QoS).","","978-1-6654-3902-2","10.1109/BigData52589.2021.9671789","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9671789","","Industries;Training;Privacy;Smart contracts;Supply chains;Quality of service;Big Data","blockchains;cloud computing;contracts;cryptography;data privacy;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix decomposition;production engineering computing;supply chain management;vectors","data frameworks;multiorganization business networks;machine learning;AI-based order fulfillment;multiorganization supply chain automation;federated learning;data privacy;decentralized distributed system;recommendation system;Ethereum blockchain network;smart contracts;items vectors;serverless model privacy;supply chain operations;enterprise cloud customers;matrix factorization;multicloud supply chain;information architectures;serverless blockchain network;homomorphic encryption","","1","","29","IEEE","13 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Load shedding is examined through this novel lens. Load shedding is an established means of preventing system collapse under emergency conditions. An auctioned load shedding hierarchy method is proposed whereby participating parties bid on tokens (SALtoks) guaranteeing access to supply during load shedding. This method is based on the recently developed Self Assessed Licenses Sold via Auction paradigm developed. Under this paradigm, SALtoks are subject to taxes based on valuations, while also being subject to continuous auction. A case study is performed on a hypothetical island power system. Higher ranking SALtoks are held by larger consumers. The method is found to mitigate economic impacts by allowing industry to maintain supply during load shedding. Smaller consumers, while subject to more frequent interruptions, gain the public benefit of increased income from taxation.","","978-1-6654-3597-0","10.1109/PowerTech46648.2021.9494957","Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9494957","load shedding;blockchain;smart contracts;to-kenised energy","Economics;Smart contracts;Finance;Load shedding;Licenses;Smart meters;Production facilities","distributed power generation;load shedding;power generation economics;power markets;smart meters;taxation","blockchain-aware smart meters;radical economic paradigms;auctioned load shedding hierarchy method;auction paradigm;emergency conditions;SALtoks;self assessed licenses sold;hypothetical island power system;taxation","","","","23","IEEE","29 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, PCN introduces an undesirable assumption that a channel participant must stay online and be synchronized with the blockchain to defend against frauds. To alleviate this issue, watchtowers have been introduced, such that a hiring party can employ a watchtower to monitor the channel for fraud. However, a watchtower might profit from colluding with a cheating counterparty and fail to perform this job. Existing solutions either focus on heavy cryptographic techniques or require a large collateral. In this work, we leverage smart contracts through economic approaches to counter collusions for watchtowers in PCNs. This brings distrust between the watchtower and the counterparty, so that rational parties do not collude or cheat. We provide detailed analyses on the contracts and rigorously prove that the contracts are effective to counter collusions with minimal on-chain operations. In particular, a watchtower only needs to lock a small collateral, which incentivizes participation of watchtowers and users. We also provide an implementation of the contracts in Solidity and execute them on Ethereum to demonstrate the scalability and efficiency of the contracts.","2641-9874","978-1-6654-0325-2","10.1109/INFOCOM42981.2021.9488831","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9488831","","Economics;Scalability;Conferences;Smart contracts;Cryptocurrency;Blockchains;Synchronization","blockchains;contracts;electronic money;financial data processing","watchtower;counter-collusion smart contracts;payment channel networks;PCN;cryptocurrency scalability;off-chain transactions;blockchain","","2","","29","IEEE","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To overcome this limitation and take full advantage of the novel technology, researchers from academia as well as industry are dedicated to find different solutions, where two or more blockchains can interact with each other. As a result, several interoperability solutions have presented themselves. To investigate the functionalities and underlying mechanisms of interoperable blockchain solutions, researchers have conducted several surveys by discussing the features and innovations of these methods. However, the existing surveys tend to focus on the architectural description of the interoperability solutions and completely overlook the most promising aspect of blockchain adaptability, namely the smart contract. This paper fills the gap by exploring the role of smart contracts in blockchain interoperability solutions. Our research has classified the existing interoperability solutions into three main categories: heterogeneous blockchains and homogeneous smart contracts, homogeneous blockchains and homogeneous smart contracts, heterogeneous blockchains, and heterogeneous smart contracts. To provide a systematic overview of the smart contracts used in blockchain interoperability, each category is further divided into subcategories by identifying the functionalities of the smart contract used. Based on our survey, a taxonomy is proposed to help classify the blockchain interoperability solutions. The interoperability solutions in each category are analyzed in-depth, and the results are presented in tabular format to illustrate the characteristics of the interoperability solutions in a meaningful way.

Emerging cryptocurrency systems based on blockchains provide a P2P trading model in a decentralized way, avoiding many problems inherent in traditional centralized platforms. However, the intrinsic anonymity makes it hard to trace identities and regulate the blockchain system when something goes wrong with the transactions, always causing financial losses to users.In this paper, we propose a blockchain trading prototype based on a traceable two-tier identity structure, which combines a personal CA-based identity with anonymous addresses to enable appealings without centrally keeping transaction data, hence protecting privacy and regulating transactions simultaneously. We develop an off-chain transaction confirmation protocol and build an on-chain regulatory agency based on smart contracts. The separation of the on-chain part from the off-chain part makes it suitable to be deployed in many cryptocurrency system that supports smart contracts. Experiments show that all the transaction data can be stored by users themselves and the regulatory agency still works independently. A security analysis on the supervision smart contract is also made.

Telehealth enables physicians and medical care providers to remotely care for patients and monitor their symptoms. Today’s telehealth systems fall short in providing transparent, immutable, traceable, auditable, secure, and trustworthy services. In addition, they are centralized and subject to the single point of control and failure. In this paper, we propose a private blockchain-based solution to overcome the aforementioned challenges. We demonstrate how specifically three important telehealth services; namely, teleconsultation, drug administration, and medical testing can be enhanced using blockchain technology. Our proposed solution also ensures integrity, immutability, accountability, and non-repudiation for telehealth transactions initiated by multiple actors. For storing and keeping track of large-size digital content, such as images and audio and video recordings of telehealth service sessions, our proposed solution is integrated with off-chain storage systems including cloud storage or a decentralized storage system as that of the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). The registered participants are provided with access privileges based on their roles to ensure that restrictions are enforced on-chain. Smart contracts are developed to maintain data provenance and generate reliable alerts and notifications. The implementation and testing details of the algorithms are presented.

In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach of data offloading and data sharing for healthcare using edge cloud and blockchain. First, an efficient data offloading scheme is proposed where IoT health data can be offloaded to nearby edge servers for data processing with privacy awareness. Then, a data sharing scheme is integrated to enable data exchange among healthcare users via blockchain.

User’s confidential personal identity may be revealed to a third party or organization, 3. Existing contact tracing systems [1][2] only focus on information sharing from one dimension, such as location-based tracing, which significantly limits the effectiveness of such systems.We propose a global COVID-19 information sharing and risk notification system that utilizes the Blockchain, Smart Contract, and Bluetooth. To protect user privacy, we design a novel Blockchain-based platform that can share consistent and non-tampered contact tracing information from multiple dimensions, such as location-based for indirect contact and Bluetooth-based for direct contact. Hierarchical smart contract architecture is also designed to achieve global agreements from users about how to process and utilize user data, thereby enhancing the data usage transparency. Furthermore, we propose a mechanism to protect user identity privacy from multiple aspects. More importantly, our system can notify the users about the exposure risk via smart contracts.

While several recent studies have shown such usage, their applicability to supply chain applications remains limited due to less governance control capability and implementation complexity with smart contracts. This paper proposes the use of a tokenized role-attribute based access control (TRABAC) as a two-level access control for supply chain applications. In particular, TRABAC combines the simplicity of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and the flexibility and fine-grained capacity of Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC). We consider these methods coupled with the use of Non-Fungible Token (NFT) as virtual assets in the supply chain. We also define four roles or parties that can have distinct and varied access rights. These roles are incorporated into TRABAC. The efficacy of TRABAC has been evaluated in five access control scenarios. Our experimental results show that TRABAC is capable of delegating access to four different supply chain roles. Importantly, TRABAC can effectively prevent unauthorized access requests by accounts that lack a valid Level 1 role or accounts that lack a valid token attribute or a tag in Level 2 of TRABAC.","","978-1-6654-1760-0","10.1109/Blockchain53845.2021.00088","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9680553","","Access control;Costs;Data integrity;Conferences;Supply chains;Smart contracts;Prototypes","access control;authorisation;blockchains;contracts;supply chains","TRABAC;smart contract;supply chain applications;governance control capability;stored data access;two-level access control;access rights;tokenized role-attribute based access control;access request authorization;token attribute;access delegation","","1","","15","IEEE","24 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we introduce a decentralized network using blockchain technology and smart contracts as a solution to manage and secure medical records storing, and transactions between medical healthcare providers. Ethereum blockchain is employed to build the blockchain. Solidity object-oriented language was utilized to implement smart contracts to digitally facilitate and verify transactions across the network (creating records, access requests, permitting access, revoking access, rejecting access). This will mitigate prevailing issues of current systems and enhance their performance, since current EMRs are stored on a centralized database, which cannot guarantee data integrity and security, consequently making them susceptible to malicious attacks. Our proposed system approach is of vital importance considering that healthcare providers depend on various tests in making a decision about a patient's diagnosis, and the respective plan of treatment they will go through. These tests are not shared with other providers, while data is scattered on various systems, as a consequence of these ensuing scenarios, patients suffer of the resulting care provided. Moreover, blockchain can meliorate the motley serious challenges caused by future use of IoT devices that provide real-time data from patients. Therefore, integrating the two technologies will produce decentralized IoT based healthcare systems.","","978-1-6654-4293-0","10.1109/JEEIT53412.2021.9634102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9634102","Blockchain;Ethereum;medical records;peer-to-peer;smart contracts;healthcare data gateways","Privacy;Smart contracts;Medical services;Real-time systems;Blockchains;Peer-to-peer computing;Synchronization","data integrity;health care;Internet of Things;medical information systems;peer-to-peer computing","healthcare system;valuable asset;decentralized network;blockchain technology;smart contracts;medical records storing;medical healthcare providers;ethereum blockchain;solidity object-oriented language;creating records;access requests;current EMRs;data integrity;security;patient;real-time data;IoT based healthcare systems;peer-to-peer network;manage;secure electronic medical records;electronic medical record;EMR;digital medical data","","","","17","IEEE","15 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Scammers take advantage of the pseudo-anonymity of blockchain to implement financial fraud. The Ponzi scheme, one of the main scam methods, has defrauded investors of large amounts of money, thereby harming their interests and hindering the application of blockchain. Unfortunately, the current detection technology typically largely relies on the source code of the contract or uses a single feature which does not fully represent the contract characteristics. In such a case, the detection of Ponzi schemes with high efficiency becomes urgent. In this paper, we propose an image-based scam detection method using an attention capsule network (SE-CapsNet) focused on Ethereum. The sequence of bytecode, the opcode frequency, and the application binary interface (ABI) call are extracted as features from the contract bytecode and ABI, further converted into grayscale images, and then mapped into three color channels to generate RGB images, which are used as the input of the model for detecting the Ponzi scheme contract. In addition, we employ fancy PCA for data augmentation to reduce the impact of imbalanced data on the detection results. Experimental results show that the image-based detection method using deep learning models can effectively detect contracts before transactions occur. Among them, our proposed SE-CapsNet obtains great detection results, with an F1 score of 98.38%.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3059806","Natural Science Foundation of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region(grant numbers:2019D01C062,2019D01C041,2020D01C028); Graduate Research Innovation Project of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region(grant numbers:XJ2020G065,XJ2019G063); National Innovation Training Project for College Students(grant numbers:201910755030); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:12061071); Higher Education of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region(grant numbers:XJEDU2017M005,XJEDU2020Y003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9354770","Blockchain;capsule network;Ethereum;Ponzi scheme;smart contract","Feature extraction;Contracts;Smart contracts;Blockchain;Malware;Task analysis;Gray-scale","computer crime;contracts;feature extraction;financial data processing;fraud;image colour analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);principal component analysis;security of data;Web sites","SE-CapsNet obtains great detection results;image-based detection method;Ponzi scheme contract;RGB images;grayscale images;application binary interface call;contract characteristics;current detection technology;main scam methods;blockchain technology;attention capsule network;image-based scam detection method","","9","","42","CCBY","16 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

At the same time, when an individual goes to a medical institution to see a doctor, the individual is not present, and the personal health data does not match the individual’s identity, resulting in a medical accident. In severe cases, it may even threaten the safety of the individual’s life. In addition, patients can not extract the existing personal health data in real time when the smart card is lost. In response to the above problems, a blockchain-based personal health data identity authentication matching scheme is proposed, which has the characteristics of data immutability and decentralization. Using fuzzy extraction technology to extract personal biometrics to generate random keys can effectively solve the problem of biometrics being unusable after the biometrics are leaked. Through smart contracts, the random key can be authenticated to achieve identity matching. The security performance analysis of the model shows that the proposed solution has security attributes such as anti-man-in-the-middle attack and anti-replay attack, and can realize anti-tampering of personal health data, and effectively protect privacy; under the premise of ensuring data security, through intelligent the contract performs access control, and personal health data can be accurately authenticated and matched with personal identity.","","978-1-6654-1227-8","10.1109/CBFD52659.2021.00091","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9759206","identity matching;data matching;blockchain;smart contract;biometrics","Smart cards;Data privacy;Biometrics (access control);Biological system modeling;Data security;Smart contracts;Authentication","authorisation;biometrics (access control);blockchains;computer crime;contracts;cryptography;data privacy;electronic data interchange;electronic health records;fuzzy set theory;pattern matching;smart cards;storage management","data immutability;personal health data identity authentication matching scheme;electronic data storage mode;blockchain;personal health data privacy;personal health data security;data decentralization;fuzzy extraction;personal biometric extraction;security performance analysis;access control;anti-man-in-the-middle attack;anti-replay attack;smart card","","","","13","IEEE","20 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed scheme recognizes the different characteristics of curtailment, such as the total length of curtailments within a window of time, or the number of separate curtailment events (i.e., curtailment startup), and compensates the end-user accordingly. The proposed compensation scheme features a piece-wise reward function comprised of two intervals. DR participants receive a onetime reward upfront when they enroll in the DR program and accept a set of predefined curtailment aspects. Curtailment aspects in excess of the agreed quantities are rewarded at a linear rate. This design is tailored to appeal to residential DR participants, and aims to secure sufficient flexibility at minimum cost. The parameters of the smart contract are optimized such that the system's social welfare is maximized. The optimization problem is modeled as a mixed-integer linear program. Consequently, this article updates the unit-commitment (UC) formulation with the commitment aspects of DR units. The proposed extension to the UC problem considers the critical aspects of DR participation, such as: the total length of interruptions within a window, the frequency of interruptions within a time-window irrespective of their length, and the net energy deviation from the original load profile. Deployment of the smart DR contract in the unit dispatch problem requires translating DR participants' characteristics to their equivalent aspects in conventional thermal generators, such as minimum up time, minimum down-time, start-up and shutdown costs.

Firstly, the master-slave chain network structure of IoT device authentication is proposed based on blockchain technology. Secondly, the reputation evaluation mechanism is introduced to estimate the reputation value of slave chain nodes and IoT devices, so as to provide basis for the selection of consensus nodes. Thirdly, by selecting the consensus node with high reputation value and optimizing the consensus stage, the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm is improved to increase the consensus throughput and improve the consensus efficiency of the authentication process. Finally, the authentication smart contract is designed to ensure fair and credible implementation of authentication rules.

These AR-based applications require on-demand computational and caching resources with low latency that can be provided via multiaccess edge computing (MEC) server. However, due to the massive growth of AR-enabled devices, the MEC server resources might be insufficient. To overcome this challenge, we can utilize the computational and caching resources of user equipment (UE) to serve the other UEs in its close vicinity. Successfully enabling such interaction among devices requires an attractive incentive mechanism. Therefore, we propose a contract theory-based incentive mechanism for enabling on-device caching for AR-based applications. In our approach, the MEC offers a reward to the UE for providing its resources (i.e., storage capacity, power, etc.).

Atypical forms of labor are gaining ground: to cope with the intensified volatility and insecurities, the market is shifting towards short-term, atypical labor agreements, imposing an increasing difficulty in monitoring and safeguarding regulations. New models of outsourcing are proliferated, challenging established employment and social protection rights. The definition of work itself, is reconsidered as the Gig economy becomes the new norm; ad-hoc, platform-based labor markets are creating employment forms that are vastly different from the long-established ones. Traditional societal mechanisms are struggling and have no choice but to rapidly adapt. The urgency for novel, global-scale frameworks to bridge the established labor market practices with the Gig economy mandates is profound. Recent advances in the fields of distributed trust, Blockchain and smart contracts, are empowering new ways of societal and administrative structuring and operation, bearing unprecedented clarity, and allowing for universally scaled solutions. In this paper we highlight the major traits of the Fourth Industrial Revolution labor market, and we present a novel labor contract architecture for the Gig economy based on smart contracts.

For cloud providers, a typical supply chain consists of complex networks of suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, auditors, and consumers. Even though there is an increased focus on self-serve or cloud provider managed SaaS (Software-as-a-service), a portion of sales for an enterprise customer occurs the old-fashioned way with the sales department drawing up a purchase order to begin the procurement process. In many cases, there could be several disjoint suppliers who fulfill the order behind the scenes unbeknownst to the buyer. In this paper we propose C3HSB, a decentralized distributed application architecture using blockchain and smart contracts to build the supply chain. Motivated by challenges in the industry, this approach can be considered as a building block for future supply chain procurement and deployment of cloud assets. The design goal for our system was to facilitate efficient handling of enterprise-scale purchase orders and alternatives in real-time while maintaining data provenance.

But the constraints are required internet for the execution of e payment system. In this system, we need trend people, standard procedures for the payment system, and enhanced technologies. An entire financial exchange is based on a bank and its network link. But the bank has a centralized system, and sometimes it is not secure. This research work proposed the toll payment system based on blockchain to provide a safer and manageable system. As the blockchain feature, this proposed model is secure and least chance to temple the data. In the working process of this system, we use mobile to read QR codes at the toll plaza for the payment.

With the advancement of the human lifestyle, everybody needs a car for their daily business. Before buying a used vehicle, the history of the vehicle should be verified. Currently, the history of the vehicle is obtained from the second-hand vehicle dealers. The data provided by dealers need not be correct because they do not maintain a proper record. The only way for the buyer is to believe the dealer and proceed with the deal. To resolve these problems, we proposed a distributed framework using blockchain technology to verify the history of the vehicles. The creator or deployer in the system is responsible for creating the registration of the vehicle with a unique VIN and it will be updated to the shared ledger. Then the vehicles are distributed to the trusted dealers in the system with the execution of the smart contract in the supply chain and finally released to the user. In the running phase, the proposed model records insurance, real-time data and maintenance services, and legal issues if any. The main advantage of the vehicle verification on the blockchain is that it can reduce the possibility of fraud and counterfeiting documents.","","978-1-6654-0295-8","10.1109/ICCISc52257.2021.9484896","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9484896","Blockchain;Smart contracts;vehicle identification;pre-owned history","Industries;Law;Supply chains;Smart contracts;Maintenance engineering;Real-time systems;Blockchains","automobile industry;blockchains;contracts;fraud;mobile computing;production engineering computing;road safety","blockchain based verification;vehicle history;pre-owned vehicle industry;automotive industry;second-hand vehicle dealers;distributed framework;blockchain technology;vehicle verification","","","","14","IEEE","20 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For example, one of the biggest problems has always been the trust in a third party, an intermediary, which is the one who usually conducts the auction and knows the bids made by the participants. Over time, traditional methods have been overtaken by new technologies that eliminate the problems that arise when using traditional methods. Blockchain technology allows us to use its inherent characteristics of privacy, traceability and decentralization to conduct auctions with a much higher level of security and to execute auctions while reducing transaction costs. In addition, the automation of operations provided by smart contracts allows us to eliminate the intermediary, leading to additional cost savings. Furthermore, in contrast to previous technologies, the pseudo-anonymity of blockchain allows us to verify the authenticity of data, mitigating malicious behavior on the part of agents. In this paper we address this challenge; we present a smart contract that allows us to run an auction within the Ethereum blockchain at a relatively low cost, eliminating the intermediary and guaranteeing the trust of the agents involved in the auction. In particular, we concentrate on dealing with egalitarian social welfare, where the goal is to maximize the utility of the agent whose utility turns out to be minimal.","","978-1-6654-2119-5","10.1109/ICCICC53683.2021.9811317","Comunidad de Madrid; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9811317","Social Welfare;Genetic Algorithms;Contracts;Auctions","Privacy;Costs;Automation;Smart contracts;Autonomous agents;Blockchains;Behavioral sciences","authorisation;blockchains;contracts;data privacy;electronic commerce;software agents;trusted computing","autonomous agents;egalitarian social welfare;auction security;Ethereum blockchain;traceability;transaction costs;smart contract;privacy;decentralization;data authenticity;e-auctions","","1","","38","IEEE","4 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A smart contract can escrow the exchange where the receiver deposits the payment, and the sender claims it by providing the goods. In the case of misbehavior, the parties provide proof on whether the received goods match the pre-agreed description or not. In general, the description is assumed to be the hash of the goods, and it is publicly known. However, without trusting the description provided by the sender, this assumption is not plausible for the scenarios where the goods are uniquely created for a specific receiver. To overcome the trust issue, sampling-based exchange protocols have been introduced where the parties use a sample of the goods as the description. Yet, the existing sampling-based proposals suffer from high on- and off-chain computational and storage costs. In this paper, we present FairDEx: an efficient sampling- based protocol that is suitable for the exchange of unique goods. Our description protocol allows us to achieve low on- and off-chain costs, which are independent of the size of the goods. The off-chain part of the protocol only utilizes highly efficient algorithms, namely hashing and symmetric key encryption. To illustrate the feasibility of FairDEx, we evaluate a research prototype on the Ethereum test network. Our results show that the cost of running FairDEx is around 0.6M gas for reasonably large sample sets, which is 30% cheaper than the state-of-the-art Ethereum-based proposals.","","978-1-6654-3485-0","10.1109/DAPPS52256.2021.00011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9566170","Fair Exchange;Blockchain;Smart Contracts","Costs;Smart TV;Conferences;Smart contracts;Prototypes;Receivers;Encryption","blockchains;contracts;cryptographic protocols","description protocol;practical exchange;unique digital goods;smart contract;fair exchange;sampling-based exchange protocols;sampling-based proposals;FairDEx;symmetric key encryption;hashing;Ethereum test network","","","","41","IEEE","20 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, establishing trust among these probable untrusted vehicles is one of the most significant challenges of such a network. The critical pitfalls of existing and traditional mechanisms are scalability, a single point of failure, maintaining the quality of service, verification, and revocation and dealing with sparsity, consistency, availability, efficiency, robustness, privacy concerns are some of the biggest challenges to be addressed. Blockchain technology, with its great success in applications like cryptocurrencies and smart contracts, is considered as one of the potential candidates to build trust in IoV.

The ultimate goal of these developments is to build a sustainable society. However, integrating and coordinating a large number of growing connections can be a challenging issue for the traditional centralized grid system. Consequently, the smart grid is undergoing a transformation to the decentralized topology from its centralized form. On the other hand, blockchain has some excellent features which make it a promising application for the smart grid paradigm. In this article, we aim to provide a comprehensive survey on the application of blockchain in smart grid. As such, we identify the significant security challenges of smart grid scenarios that can be addressed by blockchain.

A key issue in such schemes is the design and analysis of energy trading techniques involving complex interactions between an aggregator and multiple electricity suppliers (ESs) with RESs fulfilling a certain demand. This is challenging because ESs can be of various categories, such as small/medium/large scale, and they are self-interested and generally have different preferences toward trading based on their types and constraints. This article introduces a new contract theoretic framework to tackle this challenge by designing optimal contracts for ESs. To this end, a dynamic pricing scheme is developed such that the aggregator can utilize to incentivize the ESs to contribute to both baseload and peak load demands according to their categories. An algorithm is proposed that can be implemented in a distributed manner by trading partners to enable energy trading. It is shown that the trading strategy under a baseload scenario is feasible, and the aggregator only needs to consider the per unit generation cost of ESs to decide on its strategy. The trading strategy for a peak load scenario, however, is complex and requires consideration of different factors, such as variations in the wholesale price and its effect on the selling price of ESs, and the uncertainty of energy generation from RESs. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme for energy trading in the local electricity market.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2020.3018123","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9174851","Contract theory;electricity suppliers (ESs);energy trading;microgrid;renewable energy (RE)","Contracts;Power markets;Power grids;Load modeling;Renewable energy sources;Pricing","contracts;demand side management;distributed power generation;load (electric);power generation economics;power markets;pricing;renewable energy sources;smart power grids","optimal contracts;dynamic pricing scheme;aggregator;baseload scenario;local electricity market;renewable energy sources;energy trading techniques;multiple electricity suppliers;smart grid technology;RES;power sector;peak load demand;per unit generation cost;wholesale price;selling price","","13","","40","IEEE","24 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Temperature-based weather derivatives have recently emerged as an effective volumetric risk cross-hedge for Solar Power Producers, given that temperature positively correlates with solar radiation. Temperature-based put and call options, mostly traded on organized exchanges, require users to pay premiums that are costly and difficult to price. Swap contracts can serve as an economical alternative since they do not require premiums. However, they are only traded over-the-counter and are thus illiquid and liable to counterparty credit risks. For these reasons, a novel blockchain temperature-based weather derivative swap marketplace is proposed that mitigates the risks inherent in traditional swap contracts. The payoff structure and governing mechanisms of the smart contract that underpins this instrument are also developed. A preliminary investigation of this new financial instrument shows its efficacy in hedging volumetric risks of Solar Power Producers.","","978-1-6654-3597-0","10.1109/PowerTech46648.2021.9494984","Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9494984","Electricity market;renewable electricity;electricity derivatives;decentralized finance;blockchain","Measurement;Instruments;Smart contracts;Blockchains;Solar radiation;Indexes;Meteorology","blockchains;contracts;power generation economics;power markets;power system analysis computing;pricing;risk management;solar power","weather-dependent nature;solar power producers;solar radiation;blockchain temperature-based weather derivative swap marketplace;hedging volumetric risks;blockchain weather derivative financial instrument;swap contracts;payoff structure;governing mechanisms;smart contract","","4","","18","IEEE","29 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The dispatch optimization is carried out on a 48h forecasting model, where the best strategy is the one that guarantees a good operation for the day n+1 and day n+2. A nonlinear optimization approach sets battery dispatch, under operational constraints given by the Distribution System Operator contract and the battery state of charge constraint. Three types of battery chemistry are used, the lead acid, lithium ion and vanadium redox. Also, for each battery type the best methodology strategy is defined. Regarding the methodology, a neural network is used for forecasting of demand values, PV generation and tariff prices. Battery degradation cost is controlled in daily operation based on cycles and cost. Moreover, for total lifetime estimation, the Rainflow Counting technique is used through the depth of discharge. The results define an operation for the battery that allows economic profit, without compromising the lifetime.","","978-1-83953-591-8","10.1049/icp.2021.2002","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9692456","","","battery management systems;battery powered vehicles;battery storage plants;energy management systems;energy storage;hybrid electric vehicles;optimisation;photovoltaic power systems;profitability;secondary cells;tariffs","SMART ENERGY MANAGEMENT;MULTIPLE BATTERY TYPES;optimal energy management;battery energy storage systems;distribution systems;demand contracts;lifetime degradation;optimum operation;battery dispatch;aggregator tariff bill;dispatch optimization;good operation;nonlinear optimization approach;operational constraints;Distribution System Operator contract;battery chemistry;battery type;methodology strategy;tariff prices;battery degradation cost;daily operation;total lifetime estimation;time 48.0 hour","","1","","","","25 Jan 2022","","","IET","IET Conferences"

This paper proposes and develops a solution to detect fake news and hence control misinformation broadcasting in social media. Existing solutions for detecting fake news involve either using Machine learning/AI or employing a crowdsourcing-based fact-checker to evaluate the reliability of the information. In our proposed solution - ABC-verify - we designed and developed an integrated framework combining both AI and a Proof-of-stake (PoS) smart contract algorithm for crowdsourcing to achieve better accuracy than AI-only or pure crowdsourcing. The advantage of the proposed solution is two-fold. Firstly, the AI model can continuously learn from the output of the smart contract algorithm. Secondly, the validated news that is added to the blockchain is immutable. The validators from the public Ethereum blockchain stake ERC721 tokens in exchange for a reward if the information reliability were accurate. The prediction from the AI classification model is based on a pre-trained BERT model on a dataset of 10,000 labelled Twitter datasets. The AI classification model proxies as one of the validators in the PoS algorithm. The final verdict from the smart contract is then fed back into the training dataset to improve the AI classification model and achieve better overall accuracy of 93%. Unlike traditional crowdsourcing platforms, news stored within the blockchain is immutable. Furthermore, the Ethereum blockchain is transparent, and every transaction is recorded within the blockchain, hence enabling authenticity and trust between peer-to-peer transactions.","","978-1-6654-6722-3","10.1109/SOLI54607.2021.9672392","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9672392","Blockchain;BERT;Fake news;Tweets;PoS","Crowdsourcing;Training;Social networking (online);Smart contracts;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Blockchains","blockchains;contracts;crowdsourcing;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;social networking (online)","AI-blockchain integrated framework;tweet misinformation detection;social media myths;crowdsourcing-based fact-checker;public Ethereum blockchain stake ERC721 tokens;pre-trained BERT model;PoS algorithm;ABC-verify;machine learning-AI;proof-of-stake smart contract algorithm;Twitter datasets;peer-to-peer transactions;AI classification model","","3","","9","IEEE","13 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This work aims to create a secure and decentralized smart marketplace (SMP) for a fair, transparent, robust, and less expensive way of trading excess or idle traffic from a smart home by directly paying the owner of the bandwidth. The internet bandwidths may initially come from a direct Tel-com product or from other users (smart homeowners) who decide to sell their excess Internet bandwidth. The research was carried out by integrating a given smart marketplace scenario with blockchain technology using proof-of-authority (PoA) consensus mechanism. The simulation results show that the model is more reliable and appears to be an efficient solution to dealing with excess bandwidth waste and offering safe excess bandwidth trading within a smart city.

As blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum, offer very strong guarantees of untampered, deterministic execution, that can be exploited as smart contracts substrate, the problem of how to provide reliable information from the “outside world” into the contracts becomes central. In this article, we propose a system based on a Merkle tree representation of structured documents (such as all XML), with which it is possible to generate compact proofs on the content of web documents. The proofs can then be efficiently checked on-chain by a smart contract, to trigger contract action.

In this paper we present a novel mechanism for adaptive dispute cutoffs (ADCs) which ensure that users retain the opportunity to dispute fraudulent behaviours despite blockchain congestion, while increasing second-layer protocol efficiency by reducing dispute period lengths when the number of disputes is low. We present a non-interactive argument system for setting adaptive dispute periods under the current Ethereum Virtual Machine, and describe how to efficiently integrate built-in support for adaptive dispute periods in any blockchain using binary-indexed trees. We empirically demonstrate that an ADC-enabled second -layer protocol can handle a larger number of disputes and prevent more fraud than its non-adaptive counterparts even when users are slow to issue disputes, due to denial of service or blockchain congestion.","","978-1-6654-3924-4","10.1109/BRAINS52497.2021.9569814","Imperial College London; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9569814","","Protocols;Adaptive systems;Lightning;Throughput;Virtual machining;Robustness;Blockchains","blockchains;contracts;cryptographic protocols;electronic money;fraud;virtual machines","adaptive dispute periods;current Ethereum Virtual Machine;blockchain congestion;smart-contract blockchains;off-chain protocols;permissionless blockchains;smart-contracts;peer-to-peer communication;fraud attempts;current blockchains;fixed dispute period;fraudulent behaviour;off-chain protocol;adaptive dispute cutoffs;second-layer protocol efficiency;dispute period lengths;adaptive layer-two dispute cutoffs;ADC-enabled second -layer protocol","","","","16","IEEE","25 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our goal is to make online activities more secure and trusted by incorporating smart contracts in the main blockchain protocol. Using blockchain technology in recommendation systems, we will be able to make online activities more secure. A smart contract system is created that enables enterprises to use a secure database to cooperate and continuously maintain an updated model.

In this article, we propose a blockchain-based electricity trading (B-ET) ecosystem and design a smart contract to ensure transactions are conducted in a safe and reliable manner. To overcome the shortcomings of high latency in traditional Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus, we proposed a credit-based PoW consensus mechanism by integrating the concept of “stake” to improve the consortium blockchain under the B-ET ecosystem. Then, we take combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) system as an example that supplies distributed energy, and model its interactions with the agent of power grid by a novel Stackelberg game. We show that the optimal utilities of entities in a city can be obtained at the Stackelberg equilibrium by a distributed algorithm, which is guaranteed to exist and be unique.

Alice does not trust Bob, so she is not willing to pay before the good is delivered off-chain. Similarly, Bob does not trust Alice, so he is not willing to deliver the good before getting paid on-chain. Moreover, they are not inclined to use the services of a trusted third-party. Traditionally, such scenarios are handled by game-theoretic escrow smart contracts, such as BitHalo. In this work, we first show that the common method for this problem suffers from a major flaw which can be exploited by Bob in order to extort Alice. We also show that, unlike the case of auctions, this flaw cannot be addressed by a commitment-scheme-based approach. We then provide a much more general result: assuming that the two sides are rational actors and the smart contract language is Turing-complete, there is no escrow smart contract that can facilitate this exchange without either relying on third parties or enabling at least one side to extort the other.**A preprint of this work appeared in [1].","","978-1-6654-1760-0","10.1109/Blockchain53845.2021.00021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9680554","Blockchain;Trusted Third-Parties;Smart Con-tracts;Extortion;Incontractability;Escrows;Financial Technology;Programmable Blockchains;Attacks on Blockchain","Computer languages;Conferences;Smart contracts;Blockchains","blockchains;contracts;game theory;trusted computing","extortion;trusted third-parties;physical goods;blockchain;game-theoretic escrow smart contracts;smart contract language;rational actors;irrationality","","2","","26","IEEE","24 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, many Chinese people still have many doubts about the effects of China's foreign aid due to lack of relevant information. This study selects relevant data on the turnover of China's contracted projects in Asia, Africa, Latin America and North America during the period of 2010 to 2019, and uses the Difference-indifference (DID) model to compare the size of China's project investments and analyze its main directions. Based on panel data formed before and after the implementation of China's BRI, an empirical analysis shows that China's investments still mainly flow into the Asian region, and the implementation of BRI has a significant effect on Asian investments. Smart policies should focus on the improvement of data transparency and do more research to realize the impacts of BRI for the public.","1948-9447","978-1-6654-4089-9","10.1109/CCDC52312.2021.9601659","National Nature Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71463061); National Social Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:20BJY116); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9601659","China's project investment;Foreign aid;DID model;Investment direction","Analytical models;Roads;Asia;Africa;Belts;Data models;North America","contracts;government policies;investment;project management","BRI;Asian investments;foreign aid contracted projects;China's foreign project investments;China's contracted projects;China's Belt and Road Initiative;Africa;Latin America;North America;empirical analysis;smart policies;data transparency;difference-indifference model","","","","16","IEEE","30 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Compared to the traditional finance, DeFi allows customers to flexibly participate in diverse blockchain financial services (e.g., lending, borrowing, collateralizing, exchanging etc.) via smart contracts at a relatively low cost of trust. However, the open nature of DeFi inevitably introduces a large attack surface, which is a severe threat to the security of participantsfunds. In this paper, we proposed BLOCKEYE, a real-time attack detection system for DeFi projects on the Ethereum blockchain. Key capabilities provided by BLOCKEYE are twofold: (1) Potentially vulnerable DeFi projects are identified based on an automatic security analysis process, which performs symbolic reasoning on the data flow of important service states, e.g., asset price, and checks whether they can be externally manipulated. (2) Then, a transaction monitor is installed offchain for a vulnerable DeFi project. Transactions sent not only to that project but other associated projects as well are collected for further security analysis. A potential attack is flagged if a violation is detected on a critical invariant configured in BLOCKEYE, e.g., Benefit is achieved within a very short time and way much bigger than the cost. We applied BLOCKEYE in several popular DeFi projects and managed to discover potential security attacks that are unreported before.

Nowadays, Blockchain has emerged as one of the promising technologies that might overcome the security limitations. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel Blockchain based framework for proof-of-authenticity pertaining to XAI decisions. The framework stores the explanations in InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) due to storage limitations of Ethereum Blockchain. Further, a Smart Contract is designed and deployed in order to supervise the storage and retrieval of explanations from Ethereum Blockchain.

With the roll-out of 5G networks across the globe, the mobile network operators (MNOs) are looking forward to generating business-to-business (B2B) revenue by provisioning edge cloud on their networks and hosting the applications of the 3rd party application service providers (ASPs). However, in order to accelerate the adoption of MEC, it is essential to adopt open and standardized service platform as well as a flexible and trustworthy framework for service level agreement (SLA) enforcement. Edge service provisioning will involve strict QoS guarantees for offered edge services based on heterogeneous QoS requirements of different applications, thereby requiring robust, flexible and credible SLA verification and charging as a part of business support system (BSS) of the MNO. Conventional cloud SLAs are not suitable due to lack of the flexibility and credibility required for automatic enforcement in a dynamic and heterogeneous environment. To address this challenge, we propose a blockchain-based framework for credible SLA enforcement. The proposed framework leverages smart contracts to provide an immutable solution, and ensures credibility by introducing an auditing mechanism for verifying the SLA violations.","","978-1-6654-0443-3","10.1109/INFOCOMWKSHPS51825.2021.9484429","National Research Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9484429","5G;MEC;QoS;SLA;Blockchain","5G mobile communication;Conferences;Smart contracts;Quality of service;Service level agreements;Edge computing;Business","5G mobile communication;business data processing;cloud computing;contracts;quality of service;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security","credible service level agreement enforcement framework;5G edge;multiaccess edge computing;MEC;service requirements;mobile network operators;business-to-business revenue;edge cloud;3rd party application service providers;open service platform;standardized service platform;MNO;quality of service;QoS;conventional cloud SLA;framework leverages smart contracts;credible SLA enforcement;blockchain based framework;automatic enforcement;business support system;heterogeneous QoS requirements;edge services;strict QoS guarantees;edge service provisioning;trustworthy framework","","2","","9","IEEE","19 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on that, in this paper we present an implementation of a blockchain-based data marketplace utilizing the Go Ethereum (Geth) library. The implementation consists of an IoT node powered by a raspberry pi zero W, which is utilized to collect data from the environment and store it in an InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) external server, a web page that displays the marketplace, and a private blockchain that records transactions. Regarding the private blockchain, three smart contracts are developed in order to: 1) record information about the data in the marketplace; 2) record transactions that occur between users; 3) allow sellers to white/blacklist buyers' access to the data. This implementation shows that a decentralized blockchain-based marketplace is feasible and scalable, and we hope it can serve as an early model for future frameworks.","","978-1-6654-3924-4","10.1109/BRAINS52497.2021.9569838","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9569838","Blockchain;Geth;Marketplace;IoT","Access control;Data privacy;File systems;Smart contracts;Web pages;Companies;Libraries","authorisation;blockchains;contracts;data privacy;electronic commerce;file servers;Internet;Internet of Things;Web sites","Geth;privacy;access control;decentralized blockchain-based data marketplace;centralized storage;Go Ethereum library;IoT node;InterPlanetary File System external server;IPFS;Web page;smart contracts;transaction recording;raspberry pi zero W","","1","","8","IEEE","25 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The major goal of this project is to provide security to clinical data by a secure record management ledger and provide different levels of abstraction with limited access permissions using some granular access rules on smart contracts on PHR using blockchain. For emergency access we gave some permissioned access rules to the PHR dependent on emergency PHR information that patient can control access for the record using grant and revoke permissions to any doctor. We analyse the proposed framework's overall performance using Hyperledger fabric which is permissioned block chain dependent on security, privacy and accessibility and response time.","","978-1-6654-2691-6","10.1109/i-PACT52855.2021.9696931","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9696931","Personal Health Record;Granular access rules;Blockchain;Emergency access;Hyperledger fabric","Technological innovation;Privacy;Hospitals;Smart contracts;Machine learning;Fabrics;Blockchains","authorisation;blockchains;contracts;data privacy;electronic health records;health care;hospitals;records management","blockchain;security systems design;health care;health data;hospital management systems;emergency circumstances;granular access rules;permissioned access rules;emergency PHR information;personal health record monitoring system;clinical data security;record management ledger;smart contracts;Hyperledger fabric","","","","10","IEEE","8 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The problem of counterfeit spare parts has a broad impact, including country losses. Research on counterfeit spare parts has been carried out in various countries. A technology called Blockchain which developed in 2014 with the smart contract, can trace and track goods. Previous research was more theoretical. Therefore, this study aims to test or simulate blockchain technology (multichain) to trace and track spare parts in vehicle repair shops and shows how to record spare part information into the Blockchain. The research was conducted qualitatively by performing simulations and simulation results as well as validation for the research conducted on four experts, so this study could show how vehicle spare parts were recorded. The movement of vehicle parts starts from suppliers to workshops or warehouses. This study proves that blockchain technology can be used for component tracking and tracing so that the distribution of counterfeit spare parts can be minimized.","2767-7826","978-1-6654-3996-1","10.1109/ICCED53389.2021.9664878","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9664878","Counterfeit Spare Part;Blockchain Technology;Tracing and Tracking;Multichain;Blockchain simulation;Vehicle Service","Tracking;Conferences;Simulation;Smart contracts;Companies;Maintenance engineering;Blockchains","automobiles;blockchains;contracts;counterfeit goods;maintenance engineering;production engineering computing;warehousing","vehicle parts tracking;vehicle repair shops;vehicle spare parts;spare parts counterfeiting;warehouse;blockchain technology;smart contract;component tracing;car service station","","","","32","IEEE","6 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Firstly, the ontology method is used to establish the framework for knowledge unification, and the knowledge and concepts in the design and manufacturing fields are unified so as to realize the purpose of concept unification and meet the needs of efficient communication. Secondly, the blockchain method is used to establish the data management system. Through signing the smart contract, the use authority of the data involved is limited, so as to realize the data fusion in the co-design process.

Without relying on any triggering mechanism, the proposed system separates event processing from conditional coin transaction processing where conditional cryptocurrency notes can be transferred freely in an asynchronous manner, only with their asset values conditional to the linked event outcomes. The main advantage of such design is that it enables free trade of conditional assets and prevents assets from being locked.

We evaluate the proposed solution by performing cost and security analysis as well as comparing it with the existing non-blockchain and blockchain-based solutions.

Now a lot of project management methods are moving towards agile development which allows changes in requirement specification in any phase of project lifecycle. In a project there are many stakeholders. But not all of them has the same relevancy to the software requirements. Sometimes some requirement changes happen with wrong stakeholder source. These changes cause problem later. Such as unused function or missing an important function. This problem increases unnecessary cost for the project. Furthermore, change is inevitable in agile development. With frequent changes, it is difficult to track all the changes made. On the other hand, blockchain gives an immutable, traceable, decentralized platform where data can be added through consensus. In a hierarchical permissioned blockchain, the level of permission can be defined for each group or individual nodes through smart contract. Therefore, a hierarchical permissioned blockchain for stakeholder permission to make changes and traceability of mid-development requirement change is proposed. Here, it is proposed that there should be hierarchy among the stakeholders and levels of permission they have to change one or more part of the requirements according to the project needs. This control may be implemented with smart contracts and if needed, with intelligent agents as well. Also, with the immutability of blockchain and smart contracts and external databases, traceability will also be ensured.","","978-1-6654-1777-8","10.1109/ICICyTA53712.2021.9689117","Ministry of Higher Education; Universiti Teknologi Petronas; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9689117","requirement change;stakeholder priority;consensus algorithm;hierarchical permission;blockchain;smart contract;traceability","Costs;Distributed ledger;Databases;Smart contracts;Project management;Software;Fabrics","contracts;formal specification;project management;software development management","stakeholder permission;traceability;mid-development requirement change;stakeholders;smart contract;hierarchical permissioned blockchain;requirement changes;requirement elicitation;software project;project management methods;agile development;requirement specification;project lifecycle;software requirements;wrong stakeholder source;immutable platform;traceable platform;decentralized platform","","","","22","IEEE","4 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The integration of Information and Communication Technologies with power grids fosters seamless data sharing between different SG entities, which supports effective and smart governance in terms of demand response management, frequency support, and voltage stabilization. Nonetheless, this integration opens up several security and privacy concerns, namely, electricity theft, power loss, battery exhaustion, infrastructure mapping, etc. These issues become even more important with the addition of distributed energy sources, e.g. electric vehicles (EVs), battery energy storage systems, and renewable energy sources, into the SGs. We present a framework based on Software Defined Networking (SDN) and BlockChain (BC) to address two challenging issues of EV-aided SG ecosystems, namely, privacy assurance and power security. We leverage the capabilities of SDN to handle the complex interactions between different subsystems of the SG. Furthermore, we also employ BC and smart contracts' properties to secure energy transactions and data communications. We design a secure and efficient mutual authentication protocol based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and BC for privacy preservation during smart energy trading. We also proposed a BC-based smart contract for effective Demand Response Management (DRM) during bidirectional energy transfer between EVs and SG. Finally, we present experimental evaluations to validate the proposed framework's performance. The results obtained demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed scheme compared with current state-of-the-art approaches. The mutual authentication protocol designed is not only secure against major attack vectors (namely, session key security, message integrity, anonymity, forward secrecy, and so on), but it is also cost-efficient in terms of communication and computational costs. Additionally, the SC designed assures power security and maintains an adequate balance between demand and supply.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2021.3068092","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Tier 2 Canada Research Chair on the Next Generations of Wireless IoT Networks; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9408388","Blockchain;electric vehicles;energy security;Ethereum;smart contract;smart grid;privacy","Security;Elliptic curve cryptography;Batteries;Ecosystems;Peer-to-peer computing;Authentication;Vehicle-to-grid","battery powered vehicles;battery storage plants;blockchains;computer network security;cryptographic protocols;cyber-physical systems;data privacy;demand side management;distributed power generation;power engineering computing;power supply quality;power system security;public key cryptography;renewable energy sources;software defined networking;vehicle-to-grid","distributed energy sources;battery energy storage systems;renewable energy sources;software defined networking;SDN;data communications;secure authentication protocol;mutual authentication protocol;privacy preservation;smart energy trading;blockchain-based smart contract;demand response management;bidirectional energy transfer;session key security;power security;electrical vehicle;power grids;blockchain-based cyberphysical security;electric vehicles-aided smart grids ecosystems;smart grids cyberphysical systems;elliptic curve cryptography","","24","","30","IEEE","19 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To reduce the need for transmission of data to the cloud, the edge computing architecture may be adopted to facilitate machine learning at the edge of the network through leveraging on the amassed computation resources of pervasive IoT devices. In this article, federated learning (FL) is proposed to enable privacy-preserving collaborative model training at the edge of the network across distributed IoT users. However, the users in the FL network may have different willingness to participate (WTP), a hidden information unknown to the model owner. Furthermore, the development of healthcare applications typically requires sustainable user participation, e.g., for the continuous collection of data during which a user’s WTP may change over time. As such, we leverage on the dynamic contract design to consider a two-period incentive mechanism that satisfies the intertemporal incentive compatibility (IIC), such that the self-revealing mechanism of the contract holds across both periods. The performance evaluation shows that our contract design satisfies the IIC constraints and derives greater profits than that of the uniform pricing scheme, thus validating its effectiveness in mitigating the adverse impacts of the information asymmetry.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.3033806","Alibaba Group through Alibaba Innovative Research (AIR) Program and Alibaba-NTU Singapore Joint Research Institute (JRI), National Research Foundation, Singapore, under its AI Singapore Programme AISG(grant numbers:AISGGC-2019-003); Singapore Energy Market Authority (EMA), Energy Resilience(grant numbers:NRF2017EWT-EP003-041); Singapore(grant numbers:NRF2015-NRF-ISF001-2277); WASP/NTU(grant numbers:M4082187 (4080)); Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE) Tier 1 (RG16/20); Qatar University(grant numbers:IRCC [2020–003]); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9241078","Dynamic incentive mechanism;edge computing;federated learning (FL);Internet of Healthcare Things","Training;Contracts;Medical services;Data models;Computational modeling;Cloud computing;Collaboration","cloud computing;contracts;data privacy;health care;Internet;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);pricing;profitability","dynamic contract design;federated learning;smart Healthcare applications;Healthcare Things;healthcare oriented Internet;cloud-based centralized data aggregation;edge computing architecture;leveraging;amassed computation resources;pervasive IoT devices;privacy-preserving collaborative model training;distributed IoT users;FL network;different willingness;WTP;hidden information;model owner;continuous collection;two-period incentive mechanism;intertemporal incentive compatibility","","22","","34","IEEE","27 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Proposed blockchain with fraud detection technology will assist to mitigate fraudulent credit card transactions due to its intermediate parties. Authors propose a solution (B-Box.com) where credit card transactions are modeled on a blockchain so that the credit card processing can be decentralized and verifiable with an accredited set of computing nodes. This solution reduces fraud due to ambiguous contracts with the use of a smart contract between the bank and the customer. Also, this project includes a scaling mechanism to blockchain because the current projects have a lack of scalability. Moreover, the solution introduces a proactive anomaly detection to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, in which the system will resist frauds before the fraudulent transaction enters the blockchain. So the proposed solution will make transparency between the banks and the end-users and at the same time prevents frauds before it happens which helps the banks to save millions in otherwise lost due to fraud.","","978-1-7281-8876-8","10.1109/I2CT51068.2021.9418192","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9418192","Blockchain;Smart Contract;Scalability;Anomaly Detection;Information Security;Credit Card Frauds","Unsolicited e-mail;Scalability;Smart contracts;Supervised learning;Blockchain;Resists;Credit cards","contracts;credit transactions;fraud;security of data","credit card fraud prevention;decades-long history;credit cards;blockchain systems;smart contract;third-party removal;fraud detection technology;fraudulent credit card transactions;credit card processing;fraudulent transaction","","5","","35","IEEE","10 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although network slicing can realize the flexible division of 5g network resources and quickly customize virtual networks that meet the differentiated needs of customers, it is still difficult to determine the optimal service quality parameters in application scenarios. To solve the problem, this paper designs a multi-chain 5G network slicing service quality computing model to calculate the service quality parameters of the network slicing. The calculated service quality parameters can be used as an adjustment basis in the negotiation of the SLA between the customer and the network operator. However, the traditional method of calculating information across chains will cause frequent information interactions and affect efficiency. Therefore, in this scheme, we deploy a smart contract on each blockchain to calculate the information, which can reduce the frequency of information transmission and improve efficiency. In addition, in order to make the calculation between smart contracts more fluent and the requirements more relevant, this paper proposes to coordinate the development of smart contracts through multiple blockchains. Besides, to ensure the cross-chain security calculation, the signature by Cosi protocol and multi-signcryption algorithms are used in the transmission of non-private information and private information in the cross-chain process respectively. Security analysis and experimental results prove that the multi-chain 5G network slicing service quality computing model is feasible and efficient in practice.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3132388","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61802005); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality(grant numbers:M21029); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9634104","multi-chain;cross-chain;5G;network slicing;smart contract.","Network slicing;5G mobile communication;Smart contracts;Blockchains;Computational modeling;Security;Internet of Things","","","","6","","","IEEE","3 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Although numerous solutions have been proposed recently, most of these are dedicated to the vulnerabilities of the source code of smart contracts before they are deployed and cannot cover runtime security issues. For instance, the deployment of vulnerable smart contracts on Ethereum block chains could cause serious damage at runtime, because contracts deployed on block chains are indestructible and are freely used later in the public domain. In addition, smart contracts are deployed in bytecode, a form that is naturally not human-readable, and thus, users fail to perceive their vulnerabilities. In this paper, ReByte, a runtime monitoring method for security enhancement of smart contracts deployed on Ethereum, is proposed. This method is based on a function-call interceptor for smart contracts that operates at runtime, and it checks the security-related properties of smart contracts and takes the corresponding measures described in a JSON policy file. At the beginning of its runtime, a smart contract bytecode is dynamically rewritten to embed within it the policy enforcement logic. The results of experiments on real-world Ethereum smart contracts on EtherScan [18] show that the ReByte prototype efficiently enhances the safety of smart contracts.","2693-9371","978-1-6654-7836-6","10.1109/QRS-C55045.2021.00102","National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF)(grant numbers:2020R1A2C2008864); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9742256","Ethereum virtual machine (EVM);EVM byte code;Solidity;Vulnerability;Function-call interception;Monitoring;Program rewriting","Runtime;Codes;Smart contracts;Prototypes;Virtual machining;Safety;Blockchains","blockchains;computer network security;system monitoring","vulnerable smart contracts;smart contract bytecode;real-world Ethereum smart contracts;EVM bytecode;function-call interceptor;Ethereum block chains;ReByte;runtime monitoring method;security enhancement;security-related properties;JSON policy file","","","","23","IEEE","1 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Identifying and stopping the spreading of contagious epidemic such as COVID-19 is important to handling diseases. One major part contracted to find and detect their previous connections so as to then carefully dissociate any persons likely to have been affected and accommodate dispersion is to find out or explore more transmissible persons. These previous connections can be traced using smart machine such as smart watches and smart phones, which can frequently find and collect the connections and location of their infected ones through their embedded transmissions and localization methodologies or technologies, such as Global Positioning System (GPS) location-based navigation rule, Wi-Fi, biological connections, and Bluetooth. Contact Tracing is the one of the best technologies in which we use a methodology for stopping and controlling the COVID19. The main point of this review paper on the methodology of these smart technologies and figure the model of contact tracing accuracy on the flow of the COVID-19, working of contact tracing, algorithms and control of the COVID-19. In this paper, we have determined the role of contact tracing in COVID-19, effective impacts of Contact Tracing and designed a COVID-19 epidemic model that we created to evaluate the number of people quarantined and effectiveness of the steps to be taken, through the smart watches and smart phone contact tracing technique used. In this review paper, our result shows that in order to be accurate for the COVID-19 pandemic, the contact tracing technique must be traced speedily, a valuation ratio of the population must apply the smart devices technique, contact tracing application and this technology must be correct. All these rigid needs make smart device-based contact tracing rather inefficient at accommodating the flow of the virus during the COVID-19.

This paper proposes how the consensus based agreements can improve the transparency, auditability and verifiability of the transactions in a self help group “AmritaSREE”. The current system of this self help group utilises physical ledgers to record the group transactions and loans. This can cause errors and lack of transparency in the ledger.

The main property that a factoring system needs to fulfill is to prevent an invoice from being factored twice. In order to prevent double factoring, many factoring ecosystems use one or several centralized entities to register factoring agreements. However, this puts a lot of power in the hands of these centralized entities and makes it difficult for users to dispute situations in which factoring data is unavailable, wrongly recorded or manipulated by negligence or on purpose. In this article, we propose an architecture for invoice factoring registration based on a public blockchain. To solve the aforementioned drawbacks, we replace the trusted third parties for factoring registration with a smart contract. Using a smart contract, we record digital evidence of the terms and conditions of factoring agreements in explicit detail, allowing auditability and dispute resolution. Relevant information is highly available on the blockchain while its privacy is protected. The registration is optimal, since it needs only one blockchain transaction and one key-value storage per invoice factoring.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3056626","TCO-RISEBLOCK(grant numbers:PID2019-110224RB-I00); H2020-i3-MARKET; ARPASAT(grant numbers:TEC2015-70197-R,2014-SGR-1504); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9344631","Public blockchain;smart contract;double factoring;transparency;auditability;privacy;dispute resolution","Blockchain;Smart contracts;Registers;Business;Web services;Proposals;Manuals","blockchains;business data processing;contracts;data protection;financial data processing;invoicing","invoice factoring registration;public blockchain;liquidity problems;factoring agreements;trusted third parties;smart contract;privacy protection","","3","","19","CCBY","2 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, various governments have begun enforcing use of renewable energy to meet the rising electricity demands. Due to environmental and resiliency benefits, distributed energy resources are a potential solution for meeting future electricity demand. Combining the flow of the energy along with networks forms the Energy Internet. The survey provides a concise review of smart grid, blockchain architecture and their role in distributed energy trading. Solar energy has been the primary focus as the renewable energy resource for implementation purposes. Smart grid ensures an efficient distribution of the power, hold low losses, maintain degree of quality, and the safety of power supply. Such a setup has nodes including power sources and arrangements for transferring power to other nodes as well. It has various parameters that are of primary concern like power supply control, power flow execution, limiting the electricity as per the top layer transactions with help of monitoring devices, etc. Microcontrollers are responsible for interacting with the network and accessing data on it. Blockchain technology has been largely confined to finance and cryptocurrency. Recently, the technology has emerged as a distributed ledger technology which allows exchanges among participants without the need for a central market entity. The blockchain gives immutability of the transactions, which make sure each transaction among peers will be executed. It additionally gives immutability to transaction history, which may be used for audit or fixing a transaction dispute. Transaction executions are performed using smart contracts. Synchronization of the logical and physical layer between a pair of nodes forms the crux of the survey.","2380-7393","978-1-6654-1319-0","10.1109/IRSEC53969.2021.9741115","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9741115","Energy Internet;SmartGrid;Blockchain","Renewable energy sources;Power supplies;Smart contracts;Solar energy;Internet;Blockchains;Smart grids","blockchains;contracts;cryptocurrencies;distributed power generation;finance;Internet;load flow control;losses;microcontrollers;peer-to-peer computing;power engineering computing;power generation economics;power grids;power markets;reviews;smart power grids;solar power;transaction processing","blockchain based solar energy trading;cryptocurrency;data accessing;distributed energy resources;distributed ledger technology;electricity demand;energy internet;environmental resiliency benefits;government;microcontrollers;nonrenewable energy resources;physical layer;planet;potential solution;power flow execution;power supply control;smart contracts;transaction executions","","","","17","IEEE","28 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The existing traceability of the food supply chain isn’t entirely reliable and the authentic city of each stakeholder cannot be checked manually as it is a time-taking. Instead of a centralized source, a transparent and decentralized process can be adapted through Blockchain Technology to trace the food back to its source. Blockchain is a peer-to-peer network that helps keep the data in the ledger tamper-proof. It would be a way to prevent serious health risks and be versed in the origin, transport and sale of the products that consumers buy from stakeholders.

The initial period of time has multiple sources of conflicting information coming in and creating confusion about the situation. The most important immediate requirement is to create a traversal map, highlighting navigable paths to victims of the disaster and possible hazardous locations. Due to infrastructure damage, it is hard for existing centralized geospatial portals to quickly update and provide this information, which has become outdated. IoT solutions that can be deployed without extensive preparation provide the capability to quickly acquire and disseminate essential information to rescue teams. In this paper, we present a decentralized system, named DEIMOSBC, that is able to provide such a mapping service faster and more reliably, utilizing the work of volunteers and relying on a blockchain backend that is based on an IoT system. Our solution utilizes the availability of modern smartphones with GPS receivers and processing capabilities to collect sequences of GPS locations and chain them into trajectories. These trajectory data are submitted as entries into a blockchain after cleaning them through a purpose-built smart contract. DEIMOSBC relies on the inherent robustness and distributed nature of a blockchain to make collating and assembling a map from these paths more accurate and less susceptible to disruption.

Though systems that are decentralized exist such as torrent they have not been able to replace the centralized system due to the lack of authentication and security. Blockchain is a solution that mitigates those risks as it provides security and authentication for all the participants of the network.[2] The current property registration for residential and commercial developments is a centralized system where majority of the work is done on a pen and paper-based system. The current system involves a lot of vulnerabilities and people use it to cheat others and the government. Blockchain is used to provide a potential solution for many challenges of land registration.

Cryptocurrencies have recently achieved the milestone of a USD 2 trillion market cap and with such a high volume of assets involved, the need for an efficient and scalable security vulnerability detection tool in an ever-increasing list of tokens becomes of utmost priority. This paper proposes a deep learning based approach for the prediction of security vulnerabilities in ERC-20 token smart contracts. The proposal proposed by this paper is based on the use of Long Short-Term Memory neural network architecture on smart contract opcodes which are in form of sequential data.

In this work, we introduced an architecture that includes the geospatial context in the part concerned with reputation management. The proposed architecture is based on the cloud-fog-edge architecture and uses the fog layer as the management system. The devices in the fog layer form an Ethereum Blockchain network and store the Smart Contracts. These in turn allow the management functionalities to be carried out in a decentralised, transparent and secure way, which are the advantages of Blockchain. To enable the characteristics with a geospatial component, it is necessary to apply a geocoding technique. This work shows how geocoding techniques can be adapted to cover the main geospatial functionalities and compares two geocoding options (Geohash or S2). The results showed that it is possible to include the geospatial context in a decentralised reputation management system by using hierarchical geocoding techniques, and the experiments showed that both Geohash and S2 can offer a similar performance in the proposed architecture.","","978-1-6654-3156-9","10.1109/COINS51742.2021.9524217","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9524217","Internet of Things;Reputation Management;Geocoding;Blockchain","Performance evaluation;Cloud computing;Social networking (online);Microprocessors;Smart contracts;Computer architecture;Geospatial analysis","data privacy;fog;geographic information systems;Internet;Internet of Things;peer-to-peer computing;social networking (online);Web services","enabling geospatial context;IoT decentralised reputation management system;Ethereum Smart Contracts;Social Internet;human social networks;SIoT system;device reputation values;device trustworthiness;geographical location;cloud-fog-edge architecture;fog layer;management functionalities;geospatial component;geocoding technique;main geospatial functionalities;hierarchical geocoding techniques","","","","21","IEEE","2 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, they may be abused by triggering malicious rule execution with forged IoT devices or events violating the execution integrity and the intentions of the users. To address this issue, we propose a ledger based IoT platform called Ruledger, which ensures the correct execution of rules by verifying the authenticity of the corresponding information. Ruledger utilizes smart contracts to enforce verifying the information associated with rule executions, e.g., the user and configuration information from users, device events, and triggers in the trigger-action platforms. In particular, we develop three algorithms to enable ledger-wallet based applications for Ruledger and guarantee that the records used for verification are stateful and correct. Thus, the execution integrity of rules is ensured even if devices and platforms in the smart home systems are compromised.

Whereas immense usage of Electric Vehicles (EVs) as mobile energy carriers have supported distributed energy trading due to their bidirectional charging and discharging capabilities. The trustless environment of Internet of Electric Vehicles (IoEV), including fuel vehicles and EVs, encounters trading disputes and conflicting interests among trading parties. To address these challenges, we exploit consortium blockchain to maintain transparency and trust in trading activities. Smart contracts are used to tackle trading disputes and illegal actions. Data duplication problem occurs when a dishonest user sell previously traded data multiple times for financial gain. Therefore, data duplication validation is done through previously stored hash-list at roadside units (RSUs) employed with bloom filters for efficient data lookup. Removing data duplication at an earlier stage reduces storage cost. Moreover, an elliptic curve bilinear pairing based digital signature scheme is used to ensure the reliability and integrity of traded data. To ensure persistent availability of traded data, InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is used, which provides fault-tolerant and a reliable data storage without any single point of failure. On the other hand, the energy trading transactions among EVs face some security and privacy protection challenges. An adversary can infer the energy trading records of EVs, and launch the data linkage attacks. To address this issue, an account generation technique is used that hides the energy trading trends. The new account generation for an EV depends upon its traded volume of energy. The experimental results verify the efficiency of the proposed data and energy trading scheme in IoEV with the reliable and secure data storage.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3048169","King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, through the Researchers Supporting Project(grant numbers:RSP-2020/184); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9311120","Blockchain technology;smart contract;Internet of Electric Vehicles;data storage;data trading;IPFS;energy trading;privacy;data linkage attacks","Blockchain;Reliability;Electric vehicles;Smart contracts;Internet;Market research;Memory","battery powered vehicles;blockchains;contracts;data integrity;data protection;data structures;digital signatures;distributed power generation;electric vehicle charging;failure analysis;Internet of Things;power engineering computing;public key cryptography;security of data","blockchain based data;mobile energy carriers;fuel vehicles;data duplication validation;data linkage attacks;energy trading scheme;vehicular networks data trading;Internet of Electric Vehicles;IoEV;distributed energy trading;smart contracts;bloom filters;elliptic curve bilinear pairing based digital signature scheme;InterPlanetary file system;IPFS","","41","","73","CCBY","30 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the security of the IoT ecosystem remains an afterthought for most IoT providers. This action results in many cybersecurity breaches in the field, most likely due to the lack of access control mechanisms. In this paper, we propose BorderChain, an access control framework based on blockchain for IoT endpoints. The security protocol guarantees two properties. First, our proposal assures IoT users and services that they communicate with approved IoT gateways as endpoints, holding verified IoT devices that they need. Second, BorderChain also generates access tokens that the IoT service and users can use to query IoT resources legitimately inside the IoT domains. As a result, the protocol can convince IoT domain owners that the system will only authorize IoT requests that they approve. We realize our protocol in the form of a smart contract to allow many IoT entities such as IoT domain owners, IoT devices, IoT gateways, IoT vendors, IoT services, IoT users, and Internet Service Provider (ISP) to collaborate in a unified environment. We then implement entities in BorderChain as Node JS applications connecting to the Ethereum blockchain as our peer-to-peer platform. Based on our performance evaluation using several Raspberry Pi hardware and our private server, we show that BorderChain can process entities' authentication and authorization requests efficiently using all hardware resources.

However, these systems face a significant challenge when confronted with patient health record (PHR) data due to its sensitivity. In addition, patient’s data is stored and spread generally across various healthcare facilities and among providers. This arrangement of distributed data becomes problematic whenever patients want to access their health records and then share them with their care provider, which yields a lack of interoperability among various healthcare systems. Moreover, most patient health record systems adopt a centralized management structure and deploy PHRs to the cloud, which raises privacy concerns when sharing patient information over a network. Therefore, it is vital to design a framework that considers patient privacy and data security when sharing sensitive information with healthcare facilities and providers. This paper proposes a blockchain framework for secured patient health records sharing that allows patients to have full access and control over their health records. With this novel approach, our framework applies the Ethereum blockchain smart contracts, the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) as an off-chain storage system, and the NuCypher protocol, which functions as key management and blockchain-based proxy re-encryption to create a secured on-demand patient health records sharing system effectively. Results show that the proposed framework is more secure than other schemes, and the PHRs will not be accessible to unauthorized providers or users. In addition, all encrypted data will only be accessible to and readable by verified entities set by the patient.","","978-1-6654-0690-1","10.1109/UEMCON53757.2021.9666482","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9666482","Blockchain;Patient Health Records;Smart Contract;IPFS;NuCypher;Patient health records sharing;Healthcare System;Security;Privacy","Access control;Data privacy;Privacy;Sensitivity;Smart contracts;Prototypes;Medical services","blockchains;contracts;cryptographic protocols;data privacy;health care;medical information systems;storage management","healthcare facilities;blockchain framework;secured patient health records;off-chain storage system;interplanetary file system;secured on-demand patient health records sharing system;patient health record data;healthcare systems;sharing patient information;patient privacy;data security;NuCypher protocol;Ethereum blockchain smart contracts;PHR;IPFS;encrypted data;blockchain-based proxy reencryption","","7","","21","IEEE","10 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper focuses on the emerging field of robonomics, which studies the sociotechnical impact of blockchain technologies on social human-robot interaction and behavioral economics for the social integration of robots into human society. Advanced blockchain technologies such as oracles enable the on-chaining of blockchain-external off-chain information stemming from human users. In doing so, they leverage on human intelligence rather than machine learning only. In this paper, we investigate the widely studied trust game of behavioral economics in a blockchain context, paying close attention to the importance of developing efficient cooperation and coordination technologies. After identifying open research challenges of blockchain-enabled implementations of the trust game, we first develop a smart contract that replaces the experimenter in the middle between trustor and trustee and demonstrate experimentally that a social efficiency of up to 100% can be achieved by using deposits to enhance both trust and trustworthiness. We then present an on-chaining oracle architecture for a networked N-player trust game that involves a third type of human agents called observers, who track the players' investment and reciprocity. The presence of third-party reward and penalty decisions helps raise the average normalized reciprocity above 80%, even without requiring any deposit. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that mixed logical-affective persuasive strategies for social robots improve the trustees' trustworthiness and reciprocity significantly.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3068239","NSERC Discovery(grant numbers:2016-04521); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9383225","6G;behavioral economics;blockchain on-chaining;networked N-player trust game;oracles;smart contracts;social robots","Blockchain;Games;6G mobile communication;Robots;Smart contracts;Economics;Statistics","6G mobile communication;behavioural sciences;blockchains;contracts;control engineering computing;economics;game theory;human factors;human-robot interaction;trusted computing","third-party reward;observers;smart contract;social robots;human agents;networked N-player trust game;on-chaining oracle architecture;trustworthiness;social efficiency;coordination technologies;blockchain context;human intelligence;human users;blockchain-external off-chain information;human society;behavioral economics;social human-robot interaction;sociotechnical impact;robonomics;connected robotics;technological trends;high-frequency bands;On-Chaining Oracles;6G era","","6","","20","CCBYNCND","23 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The first is the most direct data copy, the second is to share data based on a data sharing protocol, and the third is to share data through a data center. These methods have a common feature, that is, the data requester will get the data of the data owner. This may cause serious problems in data security, such as data leakage and data abuse. As a data center is a centralized organization, there are risks such as data loss and data tampering. In addition, various countries have also issued a series of policies on data security issues, such as the GDPR implemented by the European Union in 2018. The blockchain technology using a decentralized model can be used as a new attempt to solve the above problems. This paper studies a data sharing scheme based on blockchain, and proposes a model that combines the Ethereum blockchain and federated learning ideas, and uses off-chain storage methods to share data. In this model, users can upload data description information to the blockchain through smart contracts, and can retrieve the required data through keywords, and then send the data identification and data processing model to the data owner in the form of transactions. The data owner can use this model to process the data, and finally return the result to the data requester. Because the data owner is in full control of his data and does not expose the source data to the outside, the use of this model for data sharing can effectively avoid problems such as data leakage, data loss, and data abuse.","","978-1-7281-6597-4","10.1109/CSCWD49262.2021.9437751","Inner Mongolia Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:2019MS06007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9437751","data sharing model;blockchain;ethereum;smart contract","Data centers;Computational modeling;Data security;Smart contracts;Europe;Blockchain;Organizations","blockchains;computer centres;contracts;learning (artificial intelligence)","Ethereum blockchain;secure data sharing model;direct data;data sharing protocol;data center;data requester;data owner;data leakage;data abuse;data loss;data security issues;data description information;data identification;source data;GDPR;federated learning ideas;European Union;smart contracts","","1","","25","IEEE","28 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the fourth industrial revolution and the industrial internet of things (IIoT), new business models and technology fields based on data-driven approaches evolve and lead to the demand for trustworthy data and secure data exchange in a decentralized system. While a comprehensive number of possible industrial use cases exists, there is a lack of experimental studies on their applicability on IIoT devices. Available performance tests mostly focus on the performance of the DLT but not on their influence on the resources of the IIoT device. Furthermore, one very important DLT, namely IOTA, which is explicitly designed for application in IoT environments, did not receive much attention yet. This was due to two major drawbacks, namely the need for a centralized instance and the lack of SC functionality in the first IOTA version compared to other DLTs such as Hyperledger. The recently published version IOTA Coordicide improved in both. This paper presents detailed results from two industrial use cases and experiments on a private DLT network based on IOTA in IIoT, focusing on the resource demands for the IIoT devices with different network setups. The results confirm the suitability of IOTA for IIoT devices. Furthermore, an overview of the required resources of the IIoT devices with different transaction rates and networks sizes is given.","","978-1-6654-3841-4","10.1109/GCAIoT53516.2021.9692985","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9692985","industrial internet of things;IOTA;distributed ledger technology;edge computing;blockchain;streaming data;smart contract;Chrysalis;Coordicide","Performance evaluation;Distributed ledger;Conferences;Smart contracts;Focusing;Data models;Fourth Industrial Revolution","blockchains;contracts;data privacy;electronic data interchange;Internet of Things;production engineering computing;trusted computing","IIoT device;smart contracts;distributed ledger technologies;fourth industrial revolution;trustworthy data;data exchange;IOTA Chrysalis;IOTS Coordicide;DLT network;Industrial Internet of Things","","1","","21","IEEE","31 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Upon the analysis of current development and the new problems of blockchain-based supply chain data management system, a new parent-children blockchain-based supply chain data supervision system is proposed, which targets to overcome the dilemma faced by the governmental regulation of supply chain. Firstly, with the characteristics of blockchain including decentralization, non-tampering and non-repudiation, the system can solve the problem puzzling the traditional database about untruthful and unreliable data, and has advantages in managing supply chain and realizing product traceability. The authenticity and reliability of data on the chain also make it easier for the government to investigate and affix the responsibility of vicious incidents. At the same time, the system adopts the parent-children chain structure and the storage mode combining on-chain and off-chain resources to overcome the contradiction between information disclosure requirements of the government and privacy protection requirements of enterprises, which can better meet the needs of various users.

A novel trend in the technology space known as blockchain has been found to address these challenges. The consensus protocols associated with blockchain provide many benefits over traditional mechanisms on the frontiers of privacy, security, and decentralization. However, while these protocols provide consensus on rewards and transactions, they do not fully address content quality. More specifically, the issues around equal voting power are often not entirely consistent regarding voting weight. In this paper, a novel Content Quality Assessment and Rewarding Mechanisms (CARM) is proposed to address the variables of content quality.

We describe here a consortium model based on distributed ledger technology that applies the old principle that “unity is strength” by deploying the economic method of Revenue Sharing as a smart contract. We illustrate the model through a prototype implementation on Hyperledger Fabric, the most widely adopted among the platforms for consortium distributed ledgers.","2642-7389","978-1-6654-2744-9","10.1109/ISCC53001.2021.9631473","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9631473","business ecosystems;enterprise consortia;supply chain management;revenue sharing;smart contracts;distributed ledger;Hyperledger;Fabric","Computers;Distributed ledger;Profitability;Computational modeling;Smart contracts;Ecosystems;Prototypes","blockchains;business data processing;contracts;cryptocurrencies;data privacy;economics;innovation management;profitability","consortium distributed ledgers;revenue-sharing business consortia;private distributed ledgers;innovative business ecosystems;enterprise consortia;cryptocurrencies;consortium DLs;traditional economy;profitability;computational efficiency;document management;unity is strength principle;smart contract;hyperledger fabric","","","","13","IEEE","15 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In response to these problems, many scholars have proposed distributing energy trading schemes based on blockchain technology by virtue of its excellent features such as distributed storage, non-tampering, traceability, and credibility. However, ordinary blockchains such as early Bitcoin, with their open and transparent on-chain transactions, can easily make the privacy and security of data from multiple parties challenging. In response to this problem, this paper proposes a distributed point-to-point energy transaction system based on ChainSQL blockchain privacy protection, and proposes a high-security and strong privacy blockchain transaction system that encrypts transaction data and has data authority management. Making full use of smart contract technology, our scheme realizes automatic settlement, traceability, and auditability of electricity transaction data.","","978-1-6654-0734-2","10.1109/ICEI52466.2021.00035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9701131","Distributed Energy Trading;Blockchain;Smart contract;Privacy protection;Carbon neutralization;Emission Peak;ChainSQL","Data privacy;Privacy;Costs;Conferences;Smart contracts;Maintenance engineering;Power markets","authorisation;blockchains;contracts;data privacy;distributed power generation;power engineering computing;power markets;SQL","distributed point-to-point energy trading system;centralized traditional electricity trading systems;blockchain technology;distributed point-to-point energy transaction system;electricity transaction data;chainSQL blockchain privacy protection;data authority management;smart contract technology;automatic settlement;encrypts transaction data","","","","12","IEEE","8 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study discusses in depth the use of blockchain technology in the food industry to explore the halal issue, how it is implemented, and details about how it works. Data recording during the supply chain process is designed using a private blockchain while handling complaints using a permissioned blockchain. The transaction system uses smart contracts which are combined into a blockchain system. The use of blockchain for handling complaints and tracking halal products is worth considering, where the results show that the tracking speed is up to 10 times faster than conventional methods and can minimize losses because the handling of issues can be more targeted.","","978-1-6654-2451-6","10.1109/IWBIS53353.2021.9631868","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9631868","halal;blockchain;supply chain;smart contract","Target tracking;Conferences;Supply chains;Smart contracts;Food industry;Information security;Big Data","blockchains;contracts;food processing industry;food products;product quality;production engineering computing;supply chains","halal food production tracking;halal food industry;halal label;blockchain technology;food products;supply chain process;tracking speed;quality issues;transaction system;smart contracts","","","","21","IEEE","28 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The characteristics of decentralization and tamper-proofing of blockchain and its distributed storage architecture can effectively solve malicious manipulation and the single point of failure. However, there are few safe and reliable data transmission methods for the significant number and various identities of users and the complex node types in the power blockchain. Thus, this paper proposes a collaborative control scheme between on-chain and off-chain power data based on the distributed oracle technology. By building a trusted on-chain transmission mechanism based on distributed oracles, the scheme solves the credibility problem of massive data transmission and interactive power data between smart contracts and off-chain physical devices safely and effectively.

Blockchain is immutable i.e. after a vote is cast, it cannot be undone, and it is decentralized and distributed and therefore there is no central authority over the voting system. These characteristics of Blockchain ensure transparency in the election. The paper involves the concept of Blockchain technology and its application in the field of Electronic Voting.

Such BCs allow for building SCs that own resources and manage permissions describing who is allowed to interact with these resources and what actions can be applied to them. However, programming languages and runtime systems used in current BCs lack a secure, flexible, and straightforward way to implement permissions within their SCs. This unnecessary complexity can lead to erroneous implementations, allowing unauthorized access. The best-known incident related to a permission problem was the “Parity Hack”, which led to the “loss” of tokens, valued at approximately 31 M USD. SAMOS designed a concept to achieve an improved access control representation. It provides a secure path to a capability-based permission management system by using opaque and substructural types. This paper presents an implementation of SAMOS in the functional SC language Mandala, which offers a mechanism to enforce the key properties of opaque and substructural types during the SC execution by using an on-chain soundness checker.","","978-1-6654-3924-4","10.1109/BRAINS52497.2021.9569787","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9569787","Blockchain;Smart Contracts;programming languages;access control;capabilities;substructural data types;SAMOS;Mandala","Access control;Computer languages;Runtime;Computer hacking;Smart contracts;Buildings;Complexity theory","authorisation;blockchains;contracts","Ethereum;decentralized approach;cryptocurrencies;programming languages;runtime systems;Parity Hack;SAMOS;capability-based permission management system;opaque type;functional SC language Mandala;public blockchains;smart contracts;access control representation;substructural type;on-chain soundness checker","","","","23","IEEE","25 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a dynamic strategy for simultaneously assigning the price and the fraction of power supply capacity to every industry located in an industrial park. The assignment strategy aims at reaching a joint benefit for all the involved enterprises (i.e., the industries and the energy distribution company). The proposed procedure involves 3 sequential algorithms. The strategy for supply capacity re-assignment is based on a double-auction mechanism, which can be applied at time periods of arbitrary duration.

In this paper, a bus fleet was fit to the electric distribution grid to optimise its impact on the grid. Three optimisation scales were selected: depot alone, together with a HV departure or with a source substation. Although the first has shown a nearly constant power use, it excludes the grid's current situation from its decision process. The latter implied large power variations at the depot. The intermediate scale showed to be a good compromise, between constant power consumption and good-fit to the grid. When grid consumption was accounted for, it was always possible to include the bus fleet without increasing the overall grid maximal power consumption. To ensure respect of the optimisation result, an incentive power template was proposed. It was then applied to the three optimisation scales. Resilience of the optimisation was tested under normal and abnormal operating conditions. Overall, Smart-Charging has shown to increase the depot's resilience. Narrower optimisation scales - depot alone or with a HV departure - have shown better resilience to abnormal conditions.","","978-1-83953-591-8","10.1049/icp.2021.1612","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9692594","","","distribution networks;electric vehicles;optimisation;power consumption;smart power grids","grid consumption;bus fleet;grid maximal power consumption;optimisation result;incentive power template;smart-charging;HV departure;electric bus depots;HV-MV connections;French DSO Enedis;smart connection contracts;local flexibilities options;grid optimisation;electric distribution grid;constant power use;power variations;intermediate scale;constant power consumption;multiple grid scale optimisation;depot resilience","","","","","","25 Jan 2022","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Many of these constructions, including operational payment channels and atomic swaps, use a building block called Hashed Time-Locked Contract (HTLC).In this work, we distill from HTLC a specification (HTLC-Spec), and present an implementation called Mutual-Assured-Destruction Hashed Time-Locked Contract (MAD-HTLC). MAD-HTLC employs a novel approach of utilizing the existing blockchain operators, called miners, as part of the design. If a user misbehaves, MAD-HTLC incentivizes the miners to confiscate all her funds. We prove MAD-HTLC’s security using the UC framework and game-theoretic analysis. We demonstrate MAD-HTLC’s efficacy and analyze its overhead by instantiating it on Bitcoin’s and Ethereum’s operational blockchains.Notably, current miner software makes only little effort to optimize revenue, since the advantage is relatively small. However, as the demand grows and other revenue components shrink, miners are more motivated to fully optimize their fund intake. By patching the standard Bitcoin client, we demonstrate such optimization is easy to implement, making the miners natural enforcers of MAD-HTLC.Finally, we extend previous results regarding HTLC vulnerability to bribery attacks. An attacker can incentivize miners to prefer her transactions by offering high transaction fees. We demonstrate this attack can be easily implemented by patching the Bitcoin client, and use game-theoretic tools to qualitatively tighten the known cost bound of such bribery attacks in presence of rational miners. We identify bribe opportunities occurring on the Bitcoin and Ethereum main networks where a few dollars bribe could yield tens of thousands of dollars in reward (e.g., $2 for over $25K).","2375-1207","978-1-7281-8934-5","10.1109/SP40001.2021.00080","Israel Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9519476","Blockchain;Smart-contracts;Mechanism-design","Privacy;Smart contracts;Bitcoin;Tools;Software;Blockchains;Security","blockchains;contracts;cryptographic protocols;formal specification;game theory","Mutual-Assured-Destruction Hashed Time-Locked Contract;called miners;MAD-HTLC's security;MAD-HTLC's efficacy;HTLC vulnerability;HTLC-Spec;MAD-HTLC;Ethereum operational blockchains","","8","","133","IEEE","26 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Smart contracts, enabled by the distributed ledger technology, can be employed in many business sectors to reduce transaction time and cost and improve identity verification and proof of ownership, just to mention a few. International trade is one of these sectors with an urgent need for improvement: a market of trillions of dollars still based on traditional paper‐based transactions. The shipping industry carries 90% of the goods of the global trade market, whose costs for processing trade documents and information have nowadays doubled those for the transport itself. The need for a digital transformation is urgent for the development of and access to new markets. Insurance, letter of credit, bill of lading, factoring, etc. could obtain substantial benefit from the use of smart contracts. The possibility to transparently track and seamlessly validate the integrity of trading activities via an immutable ledger will permit reducing intermediation risks, automating contract settlement, and dispute resolution. These efficiencies will have (i) micro effect in the transferred efficiencies to consumers and small business parties and (ii) macro effect in the trade benefits for countries and industries. This chapter will explore and explain the distinguishing features of smart contracts, the functionalities that will enable trade finance, and the benefits that their application will bring to the parties of the process.","","9781119646457","10.1002/9781119646495.ch12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9430823.pdf&bkn=9430782&pdfType=chapter","","Smart contracts;Blockchain;International trade;Service level agreements;Finance;Distributed ledger;Law","","","","","","","","14 May 2021","","","IEEE","Wiley-IEEE Press eBook Chapters"

Commercial usage of wood is one of the main reasons behind deforestation. Due to the overutilization of these resources, many exotic species of wood varieties like sandalwood, rosewood, teak wood, etc. are on the endangered list. The main reason behind the loss of those exotic species is due to over-exploitation by various means like smuggling, illegal trading, etc. There is no existing proper mechanism to check whether the varieties of trees are been saved and not over exploited. To overcome it, we propose an idea and mechanism where the usage of those trees is tracked and observed. We are using image processing and block chain technology to overcome this problem. At first, the actual number of trees in a particular area is detected using a top view image of the trees which then, the number of trees is calculated using image processing algorithms. Then smart contracts are developed to store the details of the cut down trees. These contracts are deployed into the block chain network. UI is created to seamlessly interact with the block chain network for various stakeholders. Then this UI is embedded with the block chain network to complete the module.","","978-1-6654-3986-2","10.1109/ICSCAN53069.2021.9526540","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9526540","","Automation;Animals;Image processing;Smart contracts;Vegetation;Blockchains;Stakeholders","blockchains;forestry;image processing;wood","view image;image processing;block chain network;smart tree management;biodiversity preservation;blockchain technology;deforestation;exotic species;wood varieties;teak wood","","","","16","IEEE","6 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But at the same time, the economic losses caused by the vulnerabilities of smart contracts have also emerged in recent years. One of the most famous smart contract security issues is reentrancy. There have been many related reports and researches on reentrancy. However, the existing methods only pay attention to offensive reentrancy one-sidedly, but do not conduct a systematic and comprehensive analysis of reentrancy and some existing reentrant detection methods for smart contracts often have high false positives(FPs). We proposed a more accuracy and comprehensive detection and analysis method of reentrancy from real Ethereum transactions. In general, we used Datalog-based formulation to detect reentrant transactions in real world of Ethereum, and compared the detection results with other tools. We finally detected 2,712 reentrant transactions and 10 vulnerable smart contracts with zero false positive, furthermore, we found that many vulnerable contracts detected by other tools did not trigger real reentrant transactions. We summarized the problems in the existing detection tools and gave effective preventive measures. In addition, we also analyzed the detected benign reentrancy to further confirm the above findings, and the discovery that benign reentrancy also has its certain application scenario.","","978-1-6654-2174-4","10.1109/DASC-PICom-CBDCom-CyberSciTech52372.2021.00025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9730357","reentrancy;detection tools;benign reentrancy;application scenario","Economics;Systematics;Smart contracts;Big Data;Blockchains;Security","computer network security;DATALOG;medical image processing;security of data","related reports;offensive reentrancy;systematic analysis;existing reentrant detection methods;comprehensive detection;Ethereum transactions;2 transactions;712 reentrant transactions;10 vulnerable smart contracts;vulnerable contracts;existing detection tools;detected benign reentrancy;famous smart contract security issues","","","","23","IEEE","15 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Both are strengthened in a decentralized manner. CL allows numerous clients to collectively build deep learning models privately by aggregating the gradient values from clients' devices, yet it lacks the incentive mechanism for the contributing clients. On the other hand, the merits of SCs can be a plausible solution as an incentive mechanism in the CL system because self-executing contracts with immutable data records are resistant to failure. The clients can claim the rewards by stating their contribution arbitrarily in the SCs and tendering a proof transaction function. Nevertheless, directly adopting SCs in the CL system could breach clients' privacy because the transactions are exposed openly. The observer can infer the properties of the clients' resources. Therefore, we designed schemes that can overcome observers' ability to link clients' information with their associated devices during training. In essence, our schemes are unbiased. We also provide a secure incentive mechanism for the parties in the CL system by obscuring the information values.

Facing these challenges, we propose Meepo, a systematic study on sharded consortium blockchain. Meepo enhances cross-shard efficiency via the cross-epoch and cross-call. Moreover, a partial cross-call merging strategy is designed to handle the multi-state dependency in contract calls, achieving cross-contract flexibility. Meepo employs a replay-epoch to ensure strict transaction atomicity, and it also uses a backup algorithm called shadow shard based recovery to improve the shard robustness.

Electric vehicles (EVs) are one of the main actors of IoE future. The emergence of EVs promises to reduce the environmental crisis (e.g., carbon emissions); however, their charging process will consume massive amounts of electricity and may affect the reliability of the Smart Grid (SG). Recently, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) electricity trading approach has gained momentum as a novel strategy that reduces the peak power consumption in SG. In this context, EVs compete to provide electricity with lower prices, while maintaining the V2V electricity trading system secure. However, they lack flexibility, transparency, and authenticity. More importantly, they are based on centralized models (i.e., EV aggregators) which introduce single-point-of-failure and may cause the collapse of the system. In this paper, we propose a fully decentralized blockchain-based system that allows for an automated, fair, and trustworthy V2V electricity trading system; it uses Ethereum’s smart contracts to realize the V2V electricity trading system in a fully distributed, transparent, secure, tamper-proof and trustworthy manner. The proposed system is implemented, tested, and deployed on the Ethereum official test network Ropsten.

Through large-scale experiments, it is observed that a slight increase in the customers’ possible payment would be compensated by their big gain in more demand response opportunities.

These vehicles differ from traditional fossil-fuel-based vehicles especially in the time consumed to keep them running.

Most EVSP services are based on third-party platforms, but reliance on third-party platforms creates a lack of security, leaving users vulnerable to attacks and user-privacy leakages. In this paper, we propose an anonymous blockchain-based system for charging-connected electric vehicles that eliminates third-party platforms through blockchain technology and the establishment of a multi-party security system between electric vehicles and EVSPs. In our proposed system, digital certificates are obtained by completing distributed Public Key Infrastructure (distributed-PKI) identity registration, with the user registration kept separate from the verification process, which eliminates dependence on the EVSP for information security. In the verification process, we adopt smart contracts to solve problems associated with centralized verification and opaque services. Furthermore, we utilize zero-knowledge proof and ring-signature superposition to realize completely anonymous verification, which ensures undeniability and unforgeability with no detriment to anonymity.

BAVC introduces smart contract to restrict access to the network, which deny the access of malicious vehicles. To achieve better performance and reduce the computational cost of message processing in VANET, our proposed BAVC scheme uses Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) to achieve anonymous communication of vehicles instead of using bilinear paring. We can evaluate the trustworthiness of a message according to confidence level provided by nearby vehicles which received this message. Moreover, the analysis results show that our scheme has better performance, it satisfies the security and privacy requirement with low computation cost.","2573-3311","978-1-6654-1254-4","10.1109/ICACI52617.2021.9435892","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9435892","Blockchain;VANET;Smart contract;ECC","Resistance;Privacy;Smart contracts;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Authentication;Public key;Blockchain","cryptographic protocols;data privacy;message authentication;public key cryptography;telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","blockchain technology;trusted central entity;privacy protection;vehicular ad-hoc network;VANET;efficient blockchain-based authentication scheme;vehicular secure communication;BAVC scheme;anonymous communication;privacy requirement","","3","","21","IEEE","25 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based Smart Advertising Network with Privacy-preserving Accountability (SANPA). Specifically, we design a composite Succinct Non-interactive Argument (SNARG) system, that commits advertising policies as cryptographic authenticators in a smart contract. By doing so, SANPA is compatible with the existing SAN without posing prohibitive implementation cost over the blockchain architecture. Users or retailers can require explanations of an advertising activity by sending a challenge to the smart contract. With the succinctness and privacy preservation of the SNARG system, the smart contract can efficiently verify whether the challenged advertising activity follows committed advertising policies without exposing user profile privacy. If any misconduct is identified, the contract enforces public accountability on the misbehaving party by confiscating its cryptocurrency deposits. We conduct extensive experiments to provide both on-chain and off-chain benchmarks, which demonstrates the application feasibility of SANPA.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2020.3027796","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9209996","Smart advertising network;blockchain;transparency;accountability;privacy","Advertising;Contracts;Privacy;Computer architecture;Cryptography","advertising data processing;blockchains;data privacy;retail data processing","advertising investments;blockchain-based Smart Advertising Network;Privacy-preserving Accountability;smart contract;privacy preservation;challenged advertising activity;committed advertising policies;user profile privacy;user profiles","","5","","47","IEEE","30 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Subsequently, following the principles of behavioral economics, the problem of the citizens’ incentivization by the businesses to provide their health data via offering personalized rewards is studied. The solution of the corresponding optimization problem concludes to a contract between the business and each citizen associated with this business, containing the optimal reward and optimal portion of reported data. The process is completed by introducing an optimization framework, where the healthcare operator incentivizes the businesses to provide the collected health data to it, by providing them tailored rewards. This is founded on the principles of Contract Theory, where the healthcare operator aims at maximizing its benefit from the data acquisition process, while guaranteeing that the optimal determined contracts are acceptable by the respective businesses.

Regulatory and market barriers are driving the implementation of virtual aggregation models in which the small-scale prosumers work together on a larger scale to gain benefits that could not be obtained on an individual basis. In this paper, we propose to use public blockchain and self-enforcing smart contracts to construct Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) of prosumers to provide energy services. A model has been defined for capturing the prosumer level constraints in terms of available energy profiles and energy service requirements enabling their optimal aggregation in hierarchical structures. A lightweight decentralized solution for VPPs construction is implemented using smart contracts enabling its efficient running on the public blockchain. Smart contracts are encoding the model constraints and are defining functionalities for prosumers to initiate or join a VPP implementing the complete chain of Offer-Operate-Measure-Remunerate actions. The VPP will be managed on top of a distributed ledger technology offering decentralized functionality for tracking and validating the delivery of energy based on the blockchain transactions and for energy and financial settlement, the remuneration being done according to the amount of energy provided by individual prosumers.

The proposed framework is based on blockchain technology that improves security, transparency, etc., and reduces the cost. To overcome the problem of fake certification, a chain of blocks is created for certificates that are immutable as well as transparent amongst all the nodes in the system. This paper presents a step-by-step development process for a certificate verification system using blockchain technology. The key component of this system is a smart contract. A Smart contract Certi has been developed for storing certificates by using a text editor Sublime Text3 and an IDE Remix Ethereum. The validity of the stored certificates can be checked by the employer or admission team at the time of recruitment or admission using Certi smart contract. Blockchain technology possesses its transparency feature hence at the same time the same data on the certificate can be seen by the employer, admission team as well as student itself.","2642-7354","978-1-6654-1473-9","10.1109/ICCCA52192.2021.9666311","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9666311","Blockchain Technology;Certificate Verification;Metamask;Ethereum IDE- Remix;Smart Contracts;Solidity;Sublime Text 3;Truffle IDE","Costs;Conferences;Smart contracts;Writing;Forgery;Blockchains;Security","blockchains;certification;educational administrative data processing;educational institutions;further education","storing certificates;certificate verification system;admission system;fake certification;step-by-step development process;blockchain based distributed appliacation;higher studies;smart contract","","4","","24","IEEE","10 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, they are regulated and tracked across the healthcare sector to protect the health of the general public which is a highly prioritized rule in the health professional’s code of ethics. Healthcare centers that provide controlled medication to patients are still using manual papers to record controlled drugs production, delivery, prescription, administration, and disposal which causes delays in the system. Moreover, instances of controlled drugs misuse, abuse, and diversion still exist, which shows how the currently used system is inefficient in detecting such activities. Therefore, to ensure that the public health is safe and secure, an end-to-end system that tracks the whole healthcare supply chain is necessary. In this paper, we introduce a private Ethereum blockchain-based solution for the management of controlled medication.

Moreover, FL is feasible for scenarios (e.g., autonomous cars) where an enormous amount of data is generated every day. Transferring only local model updates in the case of FL is highly communication-efficient compared to transferring all data in the case of centralized machine learning (ML). Although FL offers many advantages, it also has some challenges. A malicious aggregation server can infer device information via local model updates. Another downside of FL is the centralized aggregation server that can malfunction due to an attack or physical damage. To address these issues, we propose a novel Structured Transparency empowered cross-silo Federated Learning on the Blockchain (ST-BFL) framework. In ST-BFL, homomorphic encryption, FL-aggregators, FL-verifiers, and smart contract are employed, which satisfy various structured transparency components, such as input privacy, output privacy, output verification, and flow governance. We present the framework architecture, algorithms, and sequence diagram of our ST-BFL framework to show how different entities interact in ST-BFL for the FL process. We also present a simplified class diagram of ST-BFL’s smart contract for an FL task. Finally, we perform a simulation to analyze our framework from the perspective of aggregation time, accuracy, and storage size. The qualitative and quantitative evaluation shows that ST-BFL has the same accuracy as traditional FL. However, ST-BFL provides input privacy, output privacy, input verification, output verification, and flow governance at the expense of relatively higher computation and communication costs than traditional FL.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3128622","Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP); Korean Government through the MSIT (Evolvable Deep Learning Model Generation Platform for Edge Computing)(grant numbers:2019-0-01287); Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP); Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) of the Republic of Korea(grant numbers:20209810400030); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9617624","Blockchain;Ethereum;federated learning;flow governance;homomorphic encryption;input privacy;input verification;output privacy;output verification;smart contract;structured transparency","Smart contracts;Privacy;Servers;Computational modeling;Blockchains;Collaborative work;Task analysis","blockchains;cryptography;data privacy;learning (artificial intelligence);program verification","input privacy;output privacy;cross-silo federated learning;blockchain framework;Federated Learning relies;devices;centralized server;local model updates;centralized machine learning;malicious aggregation server;centralized aggregation server;FL-aggregators;FL-verifiers;structured transparency components;ST-BFL framework;FL process;FL task;ST-BFL smart contract;structured transparency","","5","","53","CCBYNCND","16 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address serious privacy concerns and eliminate the need for third parties to retain the trust and govern user data, in this paper, we leverage blockchain technologies in developing a secure and verifiable vaccination certificate. Our approach has the advantage of utilising a hybrid approach that implements different advanced technologies, such as the self-sovereignty concept, smart contracts and interPlanetary File System (IPFS). We rely on verifiable credentials paired with smart contracts to make decisions about who can access the system and provide on-chain verification and validation of the user and issuer DIDs.

Before a disclosure, only the original sender of each message should know its contents. To accomplish this, we task a small council with executing a distributed generation and threshold sharing of an asymmetric key pair. The public key can be used to encrypt messages which only become readable once the threshold-shared decryption key is reconstructed at a predefined point in time and recorded onchain. With blockchains like Ethereum, it is possible to coordinate such procedures and attach economic stakes to the actions of participating individuals. In this paper, we present ETHTID, an Ethereum smart contract application to coordinate Threshold Information Disclosure. We base our implementation on an existing smart contract, ETHDKG, and optimise functionality and costs to fit the TID use case. While optimising for cost savings, we show that the security of the underlying cryptographic scheme is still maintained. We evaluate how the execution costs depend on the size of the council and the threshold and show that the presented protocol is deployable with a council of more than 200 members with gas savings of 20-40% compared to ETHDKG.","","978-1-6654-2182-9","10.1109/BCCA53669.2021.9657019","Helmholtz Association; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9657019","distributed key generation;threshold encryption;smart contract;time-lock cryptography","Costs;Publishing;Smart contracts;Public key;Size measurement;Blockchains;Distributed power generation","blockchains;public key cryptography","ETHTID;Ethereum blockchain;distributed generation;threshold sharing;asymmetric key pair;public key;threshold-shared decryption key;blockchains;Ethereum smart contract application;deployable threshold information disclosure problem;protocol","","2","","25","IEEE","30 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Given the large and ever-increasing gap between the set of formalized and unformalized mathematical knowledge, there is a clear need to encourage more computer scientists and mathematicians to solve and formalize mathematical problems together. With blockchain technology, we are able to decentralize this process, provide time-stamped verification of authorship and encourage collaboration through implementation of incentive mechanisms via smart contracts. Currently, the formalization of mathematics is done through the use of proof assistants, which can be used to verify proofs as well as algorithms. Furthermore, with the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning, we can apply automated reasoning tools in these proof assistants and (at least partially) automate the process of synthesizing proofs. In our paper, we demonstrate a blockchain-based system for collaborative formalization of mathematics and programs incorporating both human labour as well as AI tools. We explain how Token-Curated Registries (TCR) and smart contracts are used to ensure appropriate documents are recorded and encourage collaboration through implementation of incentive mechanisms respectively. Using an illustrative example, we show how formalized proofs of different sorting algorithms can be produced collaboratively in our proposed blockchain system.","","978-1-6654-1760-0","10.1109/Blockchain53845.2021.00051","National Research Foundation, Singapore(grant numbers:AISG2-RP-2020-016)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9680536","blockchain;formalized mathematics;verifiable programs;token-curated registry;smart contracts;human-AI collaboration","Machine learning algorithms;Semantic search;Conferences;Smart contracts;Collaboration;Systems architecture;Machine learning","artificial intelligence;blockchains;formal verification;groupware;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);mathematics computing;sorting;theorem proving","smart contracts;proof assistants;collaborative formalization;incentive mechanisms;formalized proofs;formal proof verification;semantic searches;formalized knowledge;unformalized mathematical knowledge;computer scientists;mathematicians;mathematical problems;blockchain technology;Token-Curated Registries;TCR;automated reasoning tools","","","","17","IEEE","24 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this system, data as a digital commodity can be sold by the seller to the buyer at a certain price. We first design a conditional anonymous scheme based on block-chain and a fair trading protocol. Then we integrate them to form DPFDT to provide fairness, conditional anonymity, privacy-preserving, and decentralization. A conditional anonymous scheme means that the user’s operations are carried out through anonymous accounts, but when an anonymous account does some malicious behaviors, its real account will be traced. A protocol is said to be fair if and only if the buyer pays, and he will be guaranteed to receive the correct data. While a few fair exchange protocols based on smart contracts have been proposed, the DPFDT has the following advantages: (1) Adding privacy-preserving into the system, including the privacy of both parties’ identities in trading and the privacy of the buyers’ needs; (2) Authorizing buyers the right to specify the order. That is, sellers will be asked in the order specified by the buyer; (3) Introducing a paid trial stage in the trading process, the loss of paying for unwanted goods will be minimized. Besides, security analysis shows that the proposed scheme has transaction security and trade security. Finally, experiments are done on the Ethernet platform. It shows that the DPFDT is efficient and practical in real-life applications.","","978-1-6654-0668-0","10.1109/MSN53354.2021.00040","Research and Development; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9751506","data trading;smart contract;privacy-preserving;fairness","Privacy;Data privacy;Smart contracts;Process control;Ethernet;Sensors;Security","cryptographic protocols;data privacy;electronic commerce;protocols","DPFDT;decentralized privacy-preserving fair data trading system;smart contracts;conditional anonymous scheme;fair trading protocol;conditional anonymity;anonymous account;fair exchange protocols","","","","22","IEEE","13 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, on blockchains such as Ethereum, transactions can also represent automatic executions of programs, which are called smart contracts. Thus, many institutes in various categories show their positive attitude toward processing financial transactions or non-financial contracts on blockchain. Although many researchers have studied for various types of issues on blockchain, there always exist security and privacy concerns for blockchain. In this paper, we point out a new concern for abusing the publicity of blockchain and also show the possibility of suspicions aroused by the concern. Then we propose a selective mechanism for self-protecting against the approach from crimes or computer viruses on blockchain, whether the disclosure of user’s privacy occurs or not. Next, we also propose a concrete implementation of our proposed selective mechanism with two new address types.

This is currently estimated from the total contract capacities of the customers supplied by the grid, multiplying diversity and demand factor corresponding to the number of customers. This method is rather efficient and simple because calculations can be done simply by using contract capacities. However, such calculations may not be correct as they were derived statistically from sampled current measurements of customers. Therefore, we analyzed the SM data collected for each customer attribute information and calculated the representative profile. Machine learning is performed using the calculated representative profile as teacher data to generate a regression tree. Using the generated regression trees, we have constructed a proposal method for assuming the maximum power of the Pole-Tr to be connected together with the load curve of the new customer from the customer attribute information obtained when the customer applied for electricity use. This makes it possible to design LV distribution with higher accuracy than the conventional method.","","978-1-83953-591-8","10.1049/icp.2021.2026","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9692631","","","demand side management;distribution networks;electric current measurement;learning (artificial intelligence);load (electric);power engineering computing;power grids;power system measurement;power transformers;regression analysis;smart meters","newly-connected customer;load curve;regression tree;LV distribution grid;Pole-Tr;smart meter data;MV-LV pole-mounted transformers;LV feeders;total contract capacity;demand factor;statistical analysis;current measurement;machine learning;forecasting method","","","","","","25 Jan 2022","","","IET","IET Conferences"

This fact makes them vulnerable to manipulation and the single point of failure problem. Also, a large portion of the existing waste management systems within smart cities fall short in providing operational transparency, traceability, audit, security, and trusted data provenance features. In this paper, we explore the key role of blockchain technology in managing waste within smart cities as it can offer traceability, immutability, transparency, and audit features in a decentralized, trusted, and secure manner. We discuss the opportunities brought about by blockchain technology in various waste management use cases and application scenarios, including real-time tracing and tracking of waste, reliable channelization and compliance with waste treatment laws, efficient waste resources management, protection of waste management documentation, and fleet management. We introduce a framework that leverages blockchain-based smart contracts to automate the key services in terms of waste management of smart cities.

Electronic Health Data Management privacy issue has been raised when cloud-based data is shared between stakeholders or when records are outsourced to the cloud, resulting in sensitive or private information being disclosed by unauthorized individuals. As a result of the doctor referral management process, stakeholder communications are conducted via emails, faxes, and phone calls, which may result in errors, mistakes, and misunderstandings. This paper proposes the following solutions to the identified problems: To facilitate better sharing of healthcare records between clinicians and health care facilities through an efficient referral mechanism based on advanced smart contracts named as Patient Centric Healthcare Data Management Access Control via Smart contract (PCHDMAC-SC). Doctor referrals are made through the List referral system, which is patient-centric and restricted to doctors and other authorized providers. The results demonstrate that unauthorized access cannot be traced to healthcare records as all healthcare records are encrypted as part of the working model, which keeps personal information secure, protects personal information, makes data more scalable, and allows medical records to be shared and accessed more securely. Because of this, the system of doctor referrals results in scalability, a higher level of trust, and flexibility for all stakeholders involved.","","978-1-6654-0610-9","10.1109/CSITSS54238.2021.9683481","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9683481","Blockchain;IPFS;Scalability;Privacy;Medical Records","Cloud computing;Distributed ledger;Scalability;Smart contracts;Medical services;Data models;Blockchains","authorisation;blockchains;cryptography;data privacy;electronic health records;health care;patient care","patient-centric doctor referral model;hyperledger chaincode;financial sector;energy sector;Internet of Things;secure platform;secure data sharing;cloud-based data;sensitive information;private information;unauthorized individuals;doctor referral management process;stakeholder communications;healthcare records;health care facilities;advanced smart contracts;unauthorized access;personal information secure;medical records;electronic health data management privacy;patient centric healthcare data management access control","","2","","17","IEEE","25 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we revisit the predominant offline contract-driven mobile data access model enabling users to gain access to the infrastructure of only a few network operators and propose a new blockchain-backed mobile data access model where the key 5G stakeholders can trade, share and consume mobile edge network assets (access to the internet, spectrum, processing, storage, local content etc.) in a fully decentralized, anonymous and highly-robust fashion.

For IoT applications, the main challenges are: (1) how to describe the SLA terms, such as QoS properties, service levels, penalties in SLA violation, (2) how to monitor these terms, and (3) how to integrate an SLA into all the IoT application layers. Therefore, in this paper, we propose ML-SLA-IoT, a framework for SLA specification and monitoring. It covers the entire layers of an IoT application. It describes precisely QoS levels, provided services, and obligations. It differs from other SLA specification languages in the specification of user preferences, the use of microservices (for reusability, dynamism and ease of integration) and ML-SLA (multi-level metrics and QoS according to existing constraints and user preferences).

The coordination of DERs through an aggregator, such as a utility, system operator, or a third-party coordinator, emerges as a promising paradigm. However, it is not well understood how to enable trust between the aggregator and DERs to integrate DERs efficiently. In this paper, we develop a trustable and distributed coordination system for DERs using blockchain technology. We model various DERs and formulate a cost minimization problem for DERs to optimize their energy trading, scheduling, and demand response. We use the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the problem in a distributed fashion. To implement the distributed algorithm in a trustable way, we design a smart contract to update multipliers and communicate with DERs in a blockchain network. We validate our design by experiments using real-world data, and the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.","","978-1-6654-1268-1","10.1109/CISS50987.2021.9400211","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9400211","Smart grid;distributed energy resource (DER);energy management;distributed optimization;blockchain","Simulation;Smart contracts;Blockchain;Load management;Distributed power generation;Power systems;Optimization","blockchains;contracts;demand side management;distributed algorithms;distributed power generation;minimisation;power engineering computing;power generation scheduling;power markets;renewable energy sources;trusted computing","distributed energy resources coordination;DER;distributed renewables;decentralized system;system operator;third-party coordinator;distributed coordination system;energy trading;distributed algorithm;bidirectional power flow;blockchain technology;cost minimization problem;demand response;alternating direction method of multipliers;ADMM;trustable way;smart contract","","4","","19","IEEE","19 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Network Slice provider sells end-to-end network slices (virtual end-to- end mobile network) to the vertical while leasing virtual and physical resources from Infrastructure Providers to enforce these end-to-end network slices. Accordingly, there is a need to establish Service Level Agreement (SLA) among these actors to ensure: (1) that the service is well-delivered to the vertical and (2) the infrastructure providers are respecting their involvement with the network slice provider. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose a trust architecture to automatically manage the SLAs and apply penalties and compensations if the SLAs are not respected by one of the involved actors.","1938-1883","978-1-7281-7122-7","10.1109/ICC42927.2021.9500990","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9500990","Service level agreement;5G slicing;Security;Smart contract;Blockchain","Industries;5G mobile communication;Network slicing;Smart contracts;Quality of service;Throughput;Stakeholders","5G mobile communication;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network management;telecommunication services;trusted computing;virtualisation","trust architecture;vertical industry;network operators business;network slice provider;infrastructure provider;end-to-end network slices;virtual end-to- end mobile network;infrastructure providers;SLA management;5G networks;business market;virtual resources;physical resources;service level agreement;automatic management","","3","","10","IEEE","6 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Volunteer computing is defined as a kind of distributed computing infrastructure with a large number of computers voluntarily provided by the public. The integrated computing and storage resources are collected and processed by a central server. However, for volunteer computing, security issues are of paramount importance due to the computing source provided by the volunteers. The attack on any computer in the volunteer network may have an impact on the whole network. On the other hand, blockchain is a chain storage structure that has been widely used in recent years, and non-tamperability is one of its most important characteristics. Therefore, this research aims to improve the security and credibility of volunteer computing by using blockchain technology. Accordingly, a novel volunteer network is established on the Ethereum test network named Ropsten. Its performance and consumption are evaluated with a neural network used for computing. The results demonstrate that proper security properties of volunteer computing can be guaranteed by the proposed blockchain-based approach, although a comparatively low time cost and commission consumption is required.","2770-8470","978-1-6654-2420-2","10.1109/IIAI-AAI53430.2021.00081","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9791034","blockchain;volunteer computing;smart contract","Distributed processing;Costs;Smart contracts;Neural networks;Computer applications;Blockchains;Security","blockchains;computer network security;cryptocurrencies;volunteer computing","computing power;computing source;distributed computing infrastructure;integrated computing;novel volunteer network;volunteer computing-based neural network","","","","22","IEEE","13 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Those who take demand response into consideration are promising to enable interaction of end-users with the grid. In addition, blockchain is an effective way to secure the energy trading in the electricity market. In this paper, a new pricing mechanism based on auction is proposed to induce users to participate actively with the goal of social welfare maximization and to reduce the storage burden of blockchains. In this mechanism, each user submits individual bids to the system/auctioneer. The auctioneer makes optimal allocation with respect to the submitted bidding profile and broadcasts the market price to all the participants. To obtain the optimal trading strategy, an energy distribution algorithm is proposed. In this algorithm, each individual user updates its best response with respect to the market price, which is determined by the set of previous bidding curves. The expected system price determines the user’s best response while the resulting load pattern will change this price reversely.","","978-1-6654-3498-0","10.1109/ICPSAsia52756.2021.9621699","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9621699","auction;electricity market;pricing mechanism;demand response;smart contract","Privacy;Upper bound;Smart contracts;Pricing;Electricity supply industry;Demand response;Blockchains","electronic commerce;game theory;power markets;pricing","optimal trading mechanism;electricity market;blockchain;auction mechanisms;market price;energy trading;pricing mechanism;optimal allocation;submitted bidding profile;optimal trading strategy;energy distribution algorithm;expected system price;price reversely","","","","16","IEEE","2 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Large-scale drone-assisted environmental monitoring can provide a better perspective and high-quality data by monitoring the operation of critical components of smart cities. However, with the continuous expansion of IoD scale and the increase of multi-drone collaboration tasks, the large-scale drone-assisted service in smart cities monitoring will inevitably encounter the problem of relay and transfer of drone control. Lack of a trust collaboration paradigm between drone controllers will bring huge security challenges to real-time monitoring the environment, collaboration of tasks, data, location privacy of drones, and so on. To address this important issue in IoD, this article proposes a paradigm that uses smart contracts and blockchain to ensure trusted collaboration between controllers of software defined IoD (SD-IoD). First, we propose a novel SD-IoD architecture to enhance the support for heterogeneity and flexibility of IoD for monitoring of the environment. Second, we propose a controller consortium blockchain for secure and efficient cooperation and interoperability of drone controllers, which includes a new cryptographic currency cooperation coin and a new consensus mechanism proof of security guarantee (PoSG). Third, we have designed a novel incentive mechanism to encourage controllers to maintain their security and provide safer services to other controllers. The security analysis and performance simulation results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism.","2576-3199","","10.1109/IOTM.0011.2000045","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972255,61831007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9390454","","Smart cities;Collaboration;Blockchain;Computer architecture;Task analysis;Monitoring;Drones","computer network security;data privacy;groupware;Internet of Things;open systems;smart cities;town and country planning","blockchain enabled software-defined Internet of Drones;SD-IoD architecture;controller consortium blockchain;trusted collaboration;smart contracts;trust collaboration paradigm;drone control;smart cities monitoring;large-scale drone-assisted service;multidrone collaboration tasks;IoD scale;large-scale drone-assisted environmental monitoring;layered network control architecture;drones;collaborative environment monitoring;drone controllers;interoperability","","22","","15","IEEE","30 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

By leveraging the idle resources of smart objects at the edge, mobile device cloud (MDC) becomes promising for the IIoT data analysis, thanks to the flexible resource provision and nearby task offloading. However, MDC workers are mostly human-carried devices with large scale, high dynamic resource provision, and untruthful behaviors, which pose significant challenges on MDC task allocation. In this article, we propose a blockchain-based decentralized and truthful framework for MDC (BC-MDC). BC-MDC enables the decentralization and prevents dishonesty by incorporating a plasma-based blockchain into the MDC. We design four smart contracts for distributedly managing the worker registration, task posting/allocation, rewarding, and penalizing. Furthermore, MDC task allocation is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem that jointly minimizes the long-term processing cost and risk of task failing. We also design a truthful reward/penalty algorithm that stimulates workers to provide resources and enforce them to keep the promise as well.

A permissioned blockchain-based system will be typically built across multiple organizations. In such blockchain-based systems, system operations across multiple organizations in a decentralized manner are essential to maintain the value of introducing permissioned blockchains. Decentralized system operations have recently been becoming realistic with the evolution of permissioned blockchains. For instance, the release of Hyperledger Fabric v2.x, in which individual operational tasks for a blockchain network, such as command execution of configuration change of channels (Fabric's sub-networks) and upgrade of chaincodes (Fabric's smart contracts), can be partially executed in a decentralized manner. However, the operational workflows also include the preceding procedure of pre-sharing, coordination, and pre-agreeing the operational information (e.g., configuration parameters) among organizations, after which operation executions can be conducted, and this preceding procedure relies on costly manual tasks. To achieve efficient decentralized operations, we have developed a decentralized inter-organizational operations method that we call Operations Smart Contract (OpsSC), which defines an operational workflow as a smart contract. Our prior research proposed the concept and was focused mainly on a simple framework of OpsSC to execute a sequence of commands and prototyping with Hyperledger Fabric v1.x to validate the concept, and its applicability to the aforementioned underlying blockchain network-level operational workflows (e.g., update of channels and chaincodes) with v2.x has not sufficiently been explored yet. In this paper, we redesign and implement OpsSC for blockchain network operations with Hyperledger Fabric v2.x. This paper presents OpsSC for operating channels and chaincodes, which are essential for managing the blockchain networks, through clarifying detailed workflows of those operations. A cost evaluation based on an estimation model shows that the total operational cost for executing a typical operational scenario to add an organization to a blockchain network having ten organizations could be reduced by 54 percent compared with a conventional script-based method. The implementation of OpsSC has been open-sourced and registered as one of Hyperledger Labs projects, which hosts experimental projects approved by Hyperledger.","","978-1-6654-1760-0","10.1109/Blockchain53845.2021.00046","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9680558","permissioned blockchain;Hyperledger Fabric;system operations;blockchain network operations","Costs;Distributed ledger;Systems operation;Smart contracts;Estimation;Companies;Trademarks","blockchains;contracts;costing;peer-to-peer computing;workflow management software","blockchain network operations;blockchain network-level operational workflows;blockchain-based systems;chaincodes;decentralized blockchain network operation workflow;decentralized inter-organizational operations method;decentralized system operations;hyperledger fabric v2.x;hyperledger labs projects;individual operational tasks;multiple organizations;operating channels;operations smart contract;OpsSC;permissioned blockchain-based system","","2","","13","IEEE","24 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Also, it is shown that PoET's performance is better than PoW for multi-hosting environments. It has been observed that out of 1000 transactions sent for each round by clients through Hyperledger Caliper and REST API services, PoET could able to perform 946 transactions successfully, whereas PoW completed only 627 transactions.

However, the current models and techniques for data preservation are simply a mixture of encryption technology. The process of applying these techniques in data authentication requires the participation of the human factor as a third party, which may lead to the risk of data tampering, attacks, and cracks. Recently, Blockchain technology has occupied the place of the most disruptive technological innovation. Blockchain is based on the concept of decentralizing administration, so instead of having a single authoritative source, the system will have a plethora of records that hold the truth. Whenever a change is required or introduced, all records will need to be updated with the new information after being validated. This one-of-a-kind approach prevents the possibility of adding new information to a single record because there are so many to check to see whether it is correct. If we take the most sensitive text as a case study, then the Holy Quran represents the main reference for authenticity and integrity. However, attacks directed at the digital type of this text have witnessed a continuous increase due to the ease and speed of publishing and sharing verses and surahs and the lack of monitoring and confirmation bodies. To solve the present problem, we introduce a blockchain-based Ayat/Surah preservation model. Through the decentralization and smart contract features of the blockchain, tokens can be maintained automatically without human participation to form a guarding sub-chain in the state unit, and the blockchain has a good performance in combating attacks, which is called the 51% attack. Meanwhile, to solve the problem of data confusion and query difficulty caused by an excessive number of cases, the union of cryptography, hashes, and timestamps is used to form a concatenated master string for preservation. Due to the problem of the repetition of some verses of the Quran in some surahs and the need to absolutely guarantee the sequence of verses, the Merkle tree feature for segmentation is used to calculate the segmentation of the verses of each surah. In this way, memorizing verses becomes an automatic process that allows the Holy Quran to withstand the tests of distortion and distortion. On the other side, it gives us the ability to verify the authenticity and integrity of the Quranic texts scattered on websites and applications.","","978-1-6654-7824-3","10.1109/ICISAT54145.2021.9678467","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9678467","Blockchain;Sensitive text;Quran;Integrity;Authentication.","Technological innovation;Publishing;Smart contracts;Authentication;Human factors;Distortion;Blockchains","authorisation;blockchains;human factors;query processing;text analysis","digital sensitive text integrity;digital data sharing;data authentication;data preservation;encryption technology;human factor;disruptive technological innovation;single authoritative source;Holy Quran;authenticity;digital type;smart contract features;human participation;data confusion;query difficulty;Quranic texts;blockchain technology","","2","","0","IEEE","20 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We apply MLAV to IoT Blockchain applications in Agriculture 4.0 to demonstrate the feasibility of our solutions and models. In the current Agriculture 4.0 structure, large companies have successfully applied blockchain solutions and ecosystems for tracking and tracing agricultural produce, achieving transparency, traceability, and digitalization. However, these existing blockchain solutions are not comprehensive. First, the upstream nodes they serve are all large-scale production suppliers, and smallholders are not taken into consideration. In order to solve this problem, we use a multi-layer architecture that serves three purposes: facilitating smallholders in joining the agricultural blockchain as equal-opportunity nodes, uploading of production activity data, and reducing costs (ex.

In applying aggregate verification, we may effectively increase ID-based verification efficiency while processing large clusters of data transferred by IoT devices.

The aim is to provide the end-users total self-governance over their own data. While this enables certain degree of user empowerment, the explicit design principles of PDS architecture may prevent service providers' legitimate grounds for imposing certain restrictions on the data rights (e.g., for government regulations). In this paper, we propose a unique hybrid PDS architecture that extends SOLiD with blockchain and smart contract. The extension provides a neutral access control enforcement platform in which service providers can transparently define and operate application-wide data access policies, overriding the default user access rights in some cases, while still respecting the decentralised nature of Personal Data Store.

However, for relevant authorities to be able to identify misbehaving vehicles through their pseudonyms, it is essential that the privacy protection mechanisms only allow for conditional anonymity and not complete anonymity. In this paper, we propose the use of a permissioned consortium blockchain system with smart contract feature to facilitate secure and conditional privacy-preserving vehicular pseudonym issuance and management in a multi-jurisdictional road network. The use of a permissioned consortium blockchain helps mitigate security risks associated with the complexities in interorganizational data handling, such as in the areas of access control, data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. The proposed system architecture takes advantage of the predicted wide availability of Roadside Units (RSUs), and the highly viable, flexible and mature Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) technology for usage in vehicular pseudonymous communications. We successfully carried out a small-scale simulation of the proposed architecture using the Vehicles in Network Simulation (Veins) platform for integrated traffic and network simulation services (SUMO as the traffic simulator and OMNeT++ as the network simulator), and the Hyperledger Fabric platform as the permissioned consortium blockchain system. Simulation and performance analysis results reveal the feasibility of practical deployment of the scheme, and show that the scheme addresses the identified shortfalls of existing works, including the ability to achieve a better balance between connectivity and storage requirements.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3112013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9536245","Conditional privacy;consortium blockchain;interface management;location privacy;multi-jurisdictional;permissioned blockchain;Public Key Infrastructure (PKI);smart contract;vehicular networks;vehicular pseudonym","Blockchains;Privacy;Public key;Smart contracts;Authentication;Distributed ledger","authorisation;blockchains;data privacy;public key cryptography;telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","blockchain assisted vehicular pseudonym issuance;management system;conditional privacy enhancement;location privacy threats;vehicular ad hoc networks;pseudonyms;vehicle identifications;privacy protection mechanisms;conditional anonymity;complete anonymity;permissioned consortium blockchain system;smart contract feature;conditional privacy-preserving vehicular pseudonym issuance;multijurisdictional road network;security risks;interorganizational data handling;data integrity;system architecture;predicted wide availability;vehicular pseudonymous communications;Network Simulation platform;integrated traffic;network simulation services;traffic simulator;network simulator;performance analysis results","","13","","46","CCBYNCND","13 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In contrast to cloud computing, fog computing achieves efficient data processing without incurring large latencies or data transfers to/from the cloud. The distributed nature of fog computing makes the resource orchestration a challenge. Commonly used centralized solutions are of limited utility in this context. Moreover, fog nodes are usually resource constrained, so the implementation of the management modules should be carefully designed in order not to cause excessive overheads. On the other hand, blockchain has proven its utility beyond cryptocurrencies, to support distributed and reliable information storage. When combined with smart contracts it can provide a distributed computer where all the nodes independently and equally contribute to a common global system state, which must be agreed by consensus. This also provides inherent desirable features, such as immutability and transparency. In this work, a novel architecture called HIDRA is presented, aimed at resource orchestration in fog computing environments based on a Ethereum blockchain implementation. A prototype implementation on a testbed composed of single-board computers has been carried out. Results show the low overhead introduced into the system and its ability to perform a coordinated action among fog nodes without the intervention of any central authority.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3082197","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(grant numbers:RTI2018-098156-B-C52); Agencia Estatal de Investigación(grant numbers:PEJ2018-003001-A); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9437230","Blockchain;distributed systems;fog computing;Internet of Things;resource orchestration;smart contracts","Blockchain;Edge computing;Computer architecture;Internet of Things;Smart contracts;Cloud computing;Resource management","blockchains;distributed processing;microcomputers;resource allocation","HIDRA;distributed blockchain-based architecture;fog computing paradigm;IoT devices;cloud computing;data processing;resource orchestration;fog nodes;distributed computer;Ethereum blockchain implementation;single-board computers;edge computing environments;distributed information storage;smart contracts","","9","","52","CCBY","20 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In our scheme, the implementation of data security storage is using the blockchain and storage server together. In detail, the smart contract provides protection for data keywords, the storage server stores data after data masking, and the blockchain ensures the traceability of query transactions. The need for precise privacy data is achieved by constructing a dictionary. Cryptographic techniques such as AES and RSA are used for encrypted storage of data, keywords, and digital signatures. Security analysis and performance evaluation shows that the availability, high efficiency, and privacy-preserving can be achieved.

In our design, we construct a dual-index based on the B+ tree and the key-value pair through smart contracts, and it supports multiple query operations, such as range query and file-type query. We implement the designed method by simulating the blockchain testbed and the experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our design.","","978-1-7281-8104-2","10.1109/GLOBECOM46510.2021.9685695","Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62102204,61732022); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9685695","blockchain database;construction engineering management;smart contract;index and query;data storage","Industries;Engineering management;Conferences;Smart contracts;Blockchains;Information management;Indexes","blockchains;construction industry;information management;query processing;trees (mathematics)","blockchain-based database system;decentralized information management;anti-tamper characteristics;construction engineering management;multiple query operations;range query;file-type query;dual-index;B+ tree;key-value pair;smart contracts","","2","","17","IEEE","2 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With an alarming increase in COVID-19 cases, it is important to detect and diagnose COVID-19 in its early stages to prevent its spread. To diagnose remote patients, the Internet can be useful for accessing data of that patient. But, the Internet has also had issues related to data security, reliability, and privacy. Motivated by these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Blockchain (BC) based COVID-19 detection scheme (BCovX) for fast and reliable diagnosis of COVID-19 using chest X-Ray (CXR) images. For fast and accurate detection of COVID-19 using CXR, BCovX consists of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, using which a patient can be diagnosed for COVID-19 remotely. CNNs have performed successfully in medical imaging classification. BCovX provides reliable and secure data access and exchange using BC and smart contracts (SC). To solve issues related to data storage and its associated cost, the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) protocol is used to store medical data. We also present a real-time SC developed in Solidity to govern the transaction between the patient and the doctor. The SC has been compiled and deployed on Remix Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Finally, we have evaluated the performance of BCovX with traditional schemes in terms of storage cost, bandwidth requirements, and accuracy of the CNN model.","1938-1883","978-1-7281-7122-7","10.1109/ICC42927.2021.9500499","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9500499","COVID-19;X-Ray images;Blockchain;Convolution Neural Network;Smart Contract;Security","COVID-19;Data privacy;Scalability;Smart contracts;Medical services;Bandwidth;Loss measurement","blockchains;convolutional neural nets;data privacy;diagnostic radiography;diseases;electronic data interchange;image classification;Internet;medical image processing;reliability","remote patients;data security;COVID-19 detection scheme;BCovX;reliable diagnosis;chest X-ray images;secure data access;blockchain-based COVID diagnosis scheme;COVID-19 pandemic;Internet;convolutional neural network model;medical imaging classification;InterPlanetary File System protocol;medical data;remix integrated development environment;storage cost;data privacy;smart contracts;data exchange;data storage","","2","","11","IEEE","6 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

BCC is also designed for modularity so that it applies generally across the controller implementations.

In addition to making tool differences quantitatively observable without extensive manual effort, this approach offers a new way to detect and fix omissions in a static analysis tool's set of detectors.

As blockchain is immutable and decentralized, it can reduce the possibility of data breaches. This brings in transparency as there is no central authority over the blockchain-based crowdfunding system. This paper attempts to solve these existing issues with the aid of a digital identity management system with an underlying Blockchain system. By implementing blockchain in a digital identity management system, malicious users can be identified and action can be taken against them.

Current solution to avoid fatigue driving is to force the drivers to stop and rest for a period of time after driving continuously for more than designated hours. It’s a one-size-fitsall solution and there is no different treatment policy according to the specific situation of each driver. In this paper, we propose AutoSup that is a blockchain-based method to recognize abnormal driving behaviors of drivers and give each driver the personalized rest reminder with incentive approach. First, we propose a new way for head posture recognition to detect abnormal driving behaviors. A rest reminder alert is issued when the recognition threshold is triggered via smart contracts, which lets taxi sharing platforms perform precisely to automatically inform tired drivers instead of fixed time limit. Furthermore, we apply a novel credits system to record abnormal driving behaviors, the taxi sharing platforms could give the corresponding driver bonus credits or penalty credits respectively, which is to simply and effectively reward the compliant drivers and punish the illegal drivers. Experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness. This work distinguishes itself from others by helping taxi sharing platforms to supervise and evaluate the driving behaviors of drivers more openly, fairly and efficiently, and it could improve harmonious service relationship between the sharing platforms and drivers in the real world.","1938-1883","978-1-7281-7122-7","10.1109/ICC42927.2021.9500690","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Research and Development; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9500690","driving behaviors;head pose estimation;blockchain;smart contract;incentive mechanism","Privacy;Smart contracts;Force;Fatigue;Cameras;Magnetic heads;Security","accident prevention;behavioural sciences computing;blockchains;computer vision;feature extraction;incentive schemes;mobile computing;pose estimation;road accidents;road safety;road traffic;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing","taxi sharing platforms;fatigue driving;driving accidents;abnormal driving behavior detection;rest reminder alert;AutoSup;driving behaviors recognition supervision;incentive mechanism;blockchain;head posture recognition;smart contracts;surveillance camera","","1","","21","IEEE","6 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, WOT cannot ensure the authenticity of users’ authentication because of lack of incentive, and it cannot authenticate the specific user identity. In this paper, we propose a new distributed identification system based on blockchain, called VAPKI. This system is implemented through smart contracts on Ethereum, which is transparent and immutable. Meanwhile, it can authenticate the fine-grained attributes of user identity and strengthen the authenticity of user identity through transparent authentication.

How to acquire the accurate and real-time location of IoT devices has become a significant issue which attracts many attentions. However, some existing IoT devices do not have the ability to actively locate themselves. Meanwhile, the tampering and forgery of location also occur at times. To address these challenges, blockchain-based verified locating scheme is proposed in this paper. We embed location fingerprint as the supplement of GPS, which provides location for locating-unabled devices and increases the cost of attacks aiming at location. Besides, blockchain is leveraged in this system to model the locating environment for IoT device. The location fingerprint database on the chain guards the security of fingerprint and provides a channel for online updating and data sharing. By combining the smart contract and off-chain computing, the fingerprint locating algorithm is deployed on the blockchain, which ensures the credibility of locating through distributed computing.

Blockchains can improve supply chain integrity by providing a level playing field for resource-constrained small-to-medium size businesses to participate in a supply chain process and demonstrate trustworthiness. As with many complex and highly connected processes, significant uncertainties could arise in supply chains at the physical level of goods and transports, and the digital level of data and blockchain transactions. Supply chain uncertainties include upstream supply uncertainty, internal process uncertainty and downstream demand uncertainty, which require flexible mechanisms for run-time process adaptation that existing blockchain technologies do not adequately support. In this paper, we propose a framework that enables process adaptation through attaching and detaching process fragments defined in smart contracts to a process instance dynamically at run-time. The proposed framework is compared with an existing static process method and another existing blockchain-based solution supporting process adaptation.","","978-1-6654-3578-9","10.1109/ICBC51069.2021.9461106","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9461106","Process adaptation;Smart contracts","Uncertainty;Supply chain management;Navigation;Conferences;Supply chains;Smart contracts;Blockchain","blockchains;production engineering computing;supply chain management","process adaptation framework;blockchain-based supply chain management;blockchain technology;supply chain integrity;resource-constrained small-to-medium size businesses;supply chain process;physical level;digital level;blockchain transactions;upstream supply uncertainty;internal process uncertainty;downstream demand uncertainty;run-time process adaptation;blockchain-based solution;flexible mechanisms;static process method;smart contracts","","","","22","IEEE","24 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We present a system in which blockchain technology is used to guaranty data integrity and immutability of beneficiary registration for vaccination, avoiding identity thefts and impersonations. Smart contracts are defined to monitor and track the proper vaccine distribution conditions against the safe handling rules defined by vaccine producers enabling the awareness of all network peers. For vaccine administration, a transparent and tamper-proof solution for side effects self-reporting is provided considering beneficiary and administrated vaccine association. A prototype was implemented using the Ethereum test network, Ropsten, considering the COVID-19 vaccine distribution conditions.

Day over day It became more difficult to know whether donations are reaching the right place, or taking another course, such as financing suspicious campaigns, terrorist projects, etc. As a result, donors lose faith in these organizations, leading to a halt to interactions with charitable organizations. This makes it more difficult for charities to raise money at a great cost. This research proposed a solution to the mentioned problem using Blockchain technology, a decentralized database that provides security, transparency, and lower funding cost by eliminating the presence of third parties between donors and charities. A new track donation model was proposed which introduced several new participants that control the process of donation and remove suspicion of the charity. All donations can be tracked in Blockchain, allowing donors to know where and how their money is being used. The proposed model was implemented using Hyperledger composer then it was tested to obtain a live full track of a donation process. All donations are made using smart contracts, which allow donors to know exactly when and how their donations will be received. The Blockchain track donation system results in time-saving, reducing the cost of donation, and reduces the risk of reaching suspicious campaign donations or terrorist projects.

However, the participation of centralized trusted third-party auditor (TPA) in most of the previous work has brought new security risks, because the TPA is prone to the single point of failure. Furthermore, the existing schemes do not consider the fair arbitration and lack an effective method to punish the malicious behavior. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel blockchain-based decentralized data integrity auditing scheme without the need for a centralized TPA. By using smart contract technique, our scheme supports automatic compensation mechanism. DO and CSP must first pay a certain amount of ether for the smart contract as deposit. The CSP gets the corresponding storage fee if the integrity auditing is passed. Otherwise, the CSP not only gets no fee but has to compensate DO whose data integrity is destroyed. Security analysis shows that the proposed scheme can resist a variety of attacks. Also, we implement our scheme on the platform of Ethereum to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our scheme.","","978-1-6654-1513-2","10.1109/ICBDA51983.2021.9403079","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9403079","component;data integrity;fair arbitration;blockchain;decentralization;public auditing","Cloud computing;Data integrity;Conferences;Smart contracts;Resists;Big Data;Security","auditing;blockchains;cloud computing;contracts;data integrity;outsourcing;storage management;trusted computing","blockchain-based distributed data integrity auditing scheme;cloud storage technology;CSP;provable data possession scheme;fair arbitration;centralized TPA;smart contract technique;cloud service provider;blockchain-based decentralized data integrity auditing scheme;automatic compensation mechanism;security analysis;Ethereum;malicious behavior;centralized trusted third-party auditor","","2","","15","IEEE","23 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although, the current Electronic Medical Records (EMR) system has provided several advantages in handling patients' relevant information such as quick searching and eliminating duplicated records. However, the system is still facing the challenges of security concern particularly data manipulation issue that is considered a serious threat to data integrity. In fact, the application of blockchain technology overcomes data security problem by validating this issue based on smart contract supported with hash method of peer to peer network. This method has allowed the safe sharing of information across nodes and secures the transaction over networks through the accuracy of data transmission. Therefore, this paper aims to perform data transmission analysis of a smart contract-based hash validation method through peer to peer network (P2P). The analysis result shows that the data transmission is accurate and non-error in every node on P2P. When the number of peers and data size is increased, it has a greater effect on the processing latency. Each peer can act as both a server and a client. With 8 peers, maximum data size 2048 bytes, latency was 3,249 milliseconds which shows the latency does not increase more than the smaller data size. After that, we brought the questionnaire relating to our system to ask 34 people, the results show that 50% of them aware of the importance of medical data and 100% of data integrity.","2155-2509","978-1-7281-9127-0","10.1109/COMSNETS51098.2021.9352932","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9352932","Blockchain;Data Integrity;Electronic Medical Record;Hospital Emergency Ward;Peer to Peer","Hospitals;Data integrity;Smart contracts;Peer-to-peer computing;Data communication;Servers;Electronic medical records","blockchains;contracts;data integrity;health care;hospitals;medical information systems;patient treatment;peer-to-peer computing;records management;security of data","data transmission analysis;validation method;medical data;data integrity;hospital emergency ward;hospitals;electronic medical records system;security concern;data manipulation issue;data security problem;hash method;peer network;duplicated record elimination;patient relevenant information handling;blockchain-based electronic medical records management;smart contract-based hash validation;peer to peer network;P2P;memory size 2048.0 Byte;time 3249.0 ms","","2","","18","IEEE","17 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because they are forward markets and operate on a day-ahead timeline, the energy transactions are settled only at the movement of energy delivery. Having the option of locking the energy tokens by a third-party escrow becomes a highly desirable feature. Thus, we define a Lockable ERC20 token that provides the option for an owner to lock some of its tokens using smart contracts. A time-lock and an escrow party account or smart contract can be specified allowing the tokens to be unlocked when certain business conditions are met. For validation purposes, we have considered a peer-to-peer energy trading scenario in which the Lockable ERC20 token was used to digitize the surplus of energy of prosumers. In this case, the energy tokens committed in blockchain transactions are successfully locked up until the actual delivery of energy, the settlement considering the monitored data of energy meters.","","978-1-6654-0976-6","10.1109/ICCP53602.2021.9733665","Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9733665","Blockchain;Energy Token;ERC20;Lockable;Peer to Peer Energy Trading","Meters;Conferences;Smart contracts;Focusing;Peer-to-peer computing;Blockchains;Energy management","blockchains;contracts;peer-to-peer computing;power engineering computing;power markets;power meters","energy delivery;energy meters;decentralized energy markets;energy transactions;lockable ERC20 token;peer-peer energy trading;blockchain technology;smart contracts","","2","","37","IEEE","16 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Even if a level of service were to be agreed upon between a consumer and an operator, it is important for both parties to be able to scalably and impartially monitor the quality of service delivered in order to enforce the service level agreement (SLA). Building upon a recently proposed architecture for automated negotiation of SLAs using smart contracts, we develop a low overhead solution for monitoring these SLAs and arranging automated payments based on the smart contracts. Our solution uses cryptographically secure bloom filters to create succinct summaries of the data exchanged over fine-grained epochs.

In order to be a competitive alternative to their central counterparts, their performance needs to match up. Specifically, service allocation remains a performance bottleneck for many decentralized services.In this paper we present FLOCK, an allocation system which is highly scalable, fast, and lightweight. Furthermore, it allows nodes to indicate their preference for clients/sellers without needing to submit bids by using stable matching algorithms. We decouple the price discovery and outsource this function to a smart contract on the blockchain.Additionally, another smart contract is used to orchestrate the allocation and take care of service discovery, while trusted execution environments securely compute allocation solutions, and off-chain payment networks are used to send rewards.Evaluation of FLOCK shows that gas costs are manageable and improve upon other solutions which leverage auctions, and that our instance of the stable matching algorithm greatly improves run-time and throughput over auction counterparts. Finally, our discussion outlines practical improvements to further increase performance.","","978-1-6654-3578-9","10.1109/ICBC51069.2021.9461079","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9461079","Service Allocation;Blockchain;Stable Matching","Privacy;Conferences;Smart contracts;Blockchain;Throughput;Cryptocurrency;Resource management","cloud computing;contracts;cryptocurrencies;data privacy;outsourcing;pricing;resource allocation","stable matching algorithm;price discovery;smart contract;blockchain;service discovery;FLOCK;scalable allocation;decentralized services;service allocation;allocation system;off-chain payment networks","","","","42","IEEE","24 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The constant growth and expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) and related smart devices amplifies the aforementioned problem, especially since a large amount of e-waste is either not disposed of correctly or hoarded at home. Thus, a solution is required to ease and incentivize the correct disposal of e-waste. While the growing number of smart devices increases the amount of e-waste, they also offer new technical opportunities to solve the very same problem they create. Instead of relying on the smart device owner to correctly dispose them at the recycling center, smart devices could arrange their delivery to the nearby recycling center themselves in a self-organized manner once they reach their end-of-life or are not used any further by the owner. This work introduces the Hitchhiker service platform that addresses the given problem of smart device e-waste. We outline the ecosystem and its stakeholders by following the Design Science Research approach. Moreover, we introduce the Hitchhiker system architecture for a self-adaptive disposal system of smart devices and explain selected system engagement processes.

To facilitate the easy exchanges of real-time IoT data streams between device owners and third-party applications, it is required to provide scalable, interoperable, and secured services for large numbers of distributed IoT devices operated by different application vendors. Thanks to decentralization, immutability, and auditability, Blockchain is promising to enable a tamper-proof and trust-free framework to enhance performance and security issues in centralized DMs. However, directly integrating blockchains into large-scale IoT-based DMs still faces many limitations, such as high resource and energy demands, low transaction throughput, poor scalability, and challenges in privacy preservation. This paper introduces a novel Federated Ledgers-based Framework for Hierarchical Decentralized Data Marketplaces (Fed-DDM). In Fed-DDM, participants are divided into multiple permissioned domains given their registrations. Each domain leverages an efficient Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus protocol to commit transactions of a domain on a private intra-ledger. A public inter-ledger network adopts a scalable Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus protocol to federate multiple private intra-ledger networks. We design a smart contract-enabled inter-ledger protocol to guarantee the security of the cross-domain operations on a public federated ledger without exposing sensitive privacy information from private ledgers. A proof-of-concept prototype is implemented, and the experimental results verify the feasibility of the proposed Fed-DDM solution with performance and security guarantees.","2637-9430","978-1-6654-1278-0","10.1109/ICCCN52240.2021.9522359","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9522359","IoT-based Data Marketplaces;Federated Ledger;Blockchain;Smart Contract;Security;Privacy","Privacy;Smart cities;Scalability;Prototypes;Throughput;Stability analysis;Real-time systems","blockchains;data privacy;fault tolerance;Internet of Things;protocols","smart cities;real-time IoT data streams;device owners;third-party applications;scalable secured services;secured services;distributed IoT devices;application vendors;immutability;trust-free framework;centralized DMs;blockchains;large-scale IoT-based DMs;multiple permissioned domains;Byzantine fault tolerance consensus protocol;public inter-ledger network;Proof-of-Work consensus protocol;multiple private intra-ledger networks;smart contract-enabled inter-ledger protocol;cross-domain operations;public federated ledger;private ledgers;Fed-DDM solution;Federated Ledgers-based Framework;hierarchical decentralized data marketplaces","","2","","32","IEEE","31 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While the new generation of blockchain applications is still evolving, blockchain's technical characteristics are also advancing. Yet, immutability, a hitherto indisputable and highly advertised property according to which blockchain data cannot be edited nor deleted, remains the cornerstone of blockchain's security. Nevertheless, blockchain's immutability is being called into question lately in the light of the new erasing requirements imposed by the GDPR's “Right to be Forgotten (RtbF)” provision. As the RtbF obliges blockchain data to be editable in order restricted content redactions, modifications or deletions to be applied when requested, blockchains compliance with the regulation is indeed challenging, if not impracticable. Towards resolving this contradiction, various methods and techniques for mutable blockchains have been proposed to satisfy regulatory erasing requirements while preserving blockchains’ security. To this end, this work aims to provide a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art research approaches, technical workarounds and advanced cryptographic techniques that have been put forward to resolve this conflict and to discuss their potentials, constraints and limitations when applied in the wild to either permissioned or permissionless blockchains.","2168-6750","","10.1109/TETC.2019.2949510","European Commission; CyberSec4Europe(grant numbers:830929); LOCARD(grant numbers:832735); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8883080","Blockchain;immutability;right to be forgotten;GDPR","Blockchain;Bitcoin;Distributed ledger;Smart contracts;General Data Protection Regulation","contracts;cryptography;data privacy;electronic commerce;electronic money;financial data processing;transaction processing","complex tokens;decentralised organisations;blockchain applications;immutability;hitherto;highly advertised property;blockchain data;RtbF obliges;blockchains compliance;mutable blockchains;regulatory erasing requirements;technical workarounds;permissioned blockchains;permissionless blockchains;blockchain mutability;bitcoin;decentralised electronic payments;smart contracts","","38","","139","IEEE","25 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A few recent works have attempted to construct verifiable SSE that enables the data owner to verify the integrity of search results. Nevertheless, these verification mechanisms are highly dependent on specific SSE schemes, and fail to support complex queries. A general verification mechanism is desired that can be applied to all SSE schemes. In this work, instead of concentrating on a central server, we explore the potential of the smart contract, an emerging blockchain-based decentralized technology, and construct decentralized SSE schemes where the data owner can receive correct search results with assurance without worrying about potential wrongdoings of a malicious server. We study both public and private blockchain environments and propose two designs with a trade-off between security and efficiency. To better support practical applications, the multi-user setting of SSE is further investigated where the data owner allows authenticated users to search keywords in shared documents.

In the framework, we first develop a collaborative edge computing mechanism, where each 6G infrastructure (e.g., satellite, drone, and base station) cooperates with parked vehicles to provide services for MVs in order to improve the efficiency of the edge computing services. Then, considering the security issues, a smart-contract-based secure collaboration mechanism is designed to establish a reliable transaction environment for edge computing in 6G. Next, based on the personalized service requirements of MVs and the available resources in 6G SAGIVNs, the resource allocation strategy of each infrastructure and the competitiveness of different infrastructures are discussed to provide MVs with the optimal personalized service. After that, compared with the conventional schemes, a case is studied to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Efficiently managing energy trading between energy providers and energy consumers can lead to meet the high demand for charging EVs while reducing its cost compared to traditional power provided by the utility company. However, a large portion of the existing systems leveraged for trading energy between EVs are centralized and fall short in providing transparency, reliability, audit, security, and trustworthy features. In this paper, we propose blockchain-based energy trading using an auctioning and reputation scheme. We develop Ethereum smart contracts which enable owners of EVs to automatically request electricity to charge their vehicles in a reliable, cost-effective, secure, and trustworthy manner. The proposed approach ensures the lowest rate available by implementing a reverse auctioning scheme for fair competition between providers to provide the requested service at the lowest cost. The proposed solution enforces high quality of service through a reputation-based approach that quantifies the performance of the service providers and gives an advantage to more reputable providers.

However, Blockchain-based applications with massive IoT devices experience some limitations. The limitations are due to the linear structure and the consensus algorithms used in Blockchain that consume the participating nodes' considerable resources. In addition, IoT devices are generally with limited resources and have limited bandwidth connections. IOTA, based on Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), is a new distributed ledger technology (DLT) for IoT devices. It proves its high scalability by providing parallel data processing. However, DAG is still not mature enough to fully replace Blockchain. In previous work, we proposed combining Blockchain and IOTA technologies to allow scalable transactions where Blockchain is employed in the backend, and Tangle is used in the frontend. This paper considers the proposed solution, focusing mainly on the connector part that intermediates both DLT technologies. The connector is a decentralized software component that supports the interaction between the DLT implicitly. The experiments' results show the flexibility to merge both DLTs using a message queuing protocol that enables smart contracts to run on the Tangle nodes and enriches the new platform with reliability and working offline features.","2641-8169","978-1-6654-2789-0","10.1109/WETICE53228.2021.00023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9680586","Blockchain;IOTA;DAG;Tangle;Connector","Connectors;Distributed ledger;Scalability;Smart contracts;Supply chains;Consensus algorithm;Stability analysis","blockchains;contracts;data handling;directed graphs;Internet of Things;parallel processing;protocols;transaction processing","IoT devices;DAG;blockchain-based applications;modern business systems;directed acyclic graph;IOTA;distributed ledger technology;DLT;parallel data processing;scalable transactions;decentralized software component;message queuing protocol;smart contracts;Tangle nodes","","2","","22","IEEE","24 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although the aid of digital promises and computers allows a super high density of information storage, it does not lower the library’s complexity. As our main source of information is moving away from physical writings toward digital, the new digital library (i.e., state-run library) faces the challenges of records’ integrity and storage efficiency. Focused on this issue, we learn the demands from the Royal Library in Denmark and try to explore the use of blockchain technology.

Therefore, an edge device can abstract multiple VNFs of different infrastructure providers (InPs) as services and serve them at different times to act as a tenant for different InPs. Deploying edge devices is expensive and difficult to manage. Hence, crowdsourced edge devices can be used. To ensure the quality and availability of the services and the privacy of sensitive data of the service stakeholders, it is extremely important to establish a service level agreement (SLA) between an edge device owner and an InP. For monitoring of SLA compliance and enforcing accountability, a trusted platform is required. The traditional NFV management authority cannot be trusted due to its centralized characteristics. In this article, we propose a blockchain-powered framework for the SLA compliance of edge devices offering VNFs as services and introduce a smart contract-driven framework to establish trust in edge-based NFV.

Later on, Algorand claimed to have resolved Buterin's blockchain Trilemma and is nowadays increasingly adopted by designers of decentralized computations. Motivated by the need of selecting a blockchain to run some decentralized computations, we observe the limitations of using the Trilemma as benchmark, and we propose as alternative a Quadrilemma that takes into account also computational effectiveness, namely the capability of running non-trivial decentralized computations at affordable costs. For concreteness, motivated by the current trends of using blockchains for the management of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) related to highly desired items (i.e., NFTs for art), we consider the use case of decentralized auctions in various scenarios that mainly differ on the desired degree of confidentiality. Our contribution gives the following insights. Except very limited cases where also Bitcoin can be taken into account (i.e., when latency is not a big deal and only notarization is required), Algorand can often be the right choice as long as decentralized computations consist of basic operations only. Instead, Ethereum is advisable when more sophisticated computations are required, in particular when ad-hoc cryptographic tasks are essential, and one can afford the involved costs and latency. Focusing on those three blockchains, the state of affairs about resolving the blockchain Quadrilemma is somewhat unsatisfying. Even in natural cases where computations and storage requirements for a smart contract are low (e.g., public-key encryption), none of those decentralized computers achieves simultaneously low cost and fast transaction confirmations.","2642-7389","978-1-6654-2744-9","10.1109/ISCC53001.2021.9631511","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9631511","Quadrilemma;Computational Effectiveness;Auctions;Comparisons;Decentralized Computations","Costs;Scalability;Smart contracts;Public key;Bitcoin;Market research;Blockchains","contracts;electronic commerce;electronic money;public key cryptography;transaction processing","computational effectiveness matters;decentralized computer;decentralized computations;nonfungible tokens;decentralized auctions;storage requirements;Buterin blockchain trilemma;blockchain quadrilemma;NFT;Bitcoin;Ethereum;ad-hoc cryptographic tasks;smart contract;public-key encryption;transaction confirmations","","1","","22","IEEE","15 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The age of big data providing immense volumes of data points offers greater knowledge, such as groundbreaking research, successful management choices and greater consumer value. The details should be treated effectively in order to accomplish these objectives. The data can be in any form like structured information, unstructured information, and semi-structured records. The data can be accessed from several sources such as sensors, IOT, contact network to network, mobile to mobile communication, etc. Information security is almost as broad as big data. Information Security is pursuing essential sensitive data standards. Details relating to hospitals, client data, biometric data, financial data, confidential information, etc. can be sensitive data. Therefore, hackers can target and get confidential data quickly. If any improper access to confidential information may lead to data loss, the trust of businesses can be undermined by modification or misuse. To ensure the confidentiality of sensitive data, cryptographic methods are used. Data collection, data search and data processing should be protected by a security framework. Therefore, to deal with these systems, a new effective scheme is proposed. This study focuses on blockchain technologies to ensure critical data protection. Blockchain is a distributed database that is a collection of cryptography-generated data blocks.

In this paper, we present a multi-organisational delegation framework using blockchain. Our framework takes advantage of blockchain smart contracts to define the interactions and resource allocation between the consortium of organisations.

However, supply chain participants resist storing most data on blockchains due to business confidentiality concerns. Permissioned blockchains can partly address such concerns. However, even on a permissioned blockchain, it is nontrivial to determine who can see what data given multiple access control models spanning multiple layers and various complex business relation-ships among the partners within a blockchain-based consortium. Consequently, most data are kept off-chain, vastly limiting the on-chain business logic execution that could otherwise enhance au-tomation, efficiency, and real-time compliance enforcement. This paper presents a multi-layered and multi-model access control analysis of an agriculture supply chain based on Hyperledger Fabric. First, we model five layers of access control in Fabric-based applications where different layers adopt different access control models. The smart contract layer may also adopt multiple and hierarchical access control models. Second, using NIST's access control rule logic circuit simulation technique, we modeled and validated the safeness of policies governing both Fabric configuration management and data access within the supply chain. Finally, we conducted a reflective privacy assessment to enhance supply chain participants' confidence in storing data on-chain by answering queries like “which other participants can see my data?”.","","978-1-6654-1623-8","10.1109/TPSISA52974.2021.00039","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9750255","Access control;blockchain;case study;policy;privacy;supply chain","Access control;Supply chains;Smart contracts;Resists;Data models;Fabrics;Agriculture","agriculture;authorisation;blockchains;circuit simulation;contracts;data privacy;supply chain management","modeling multilayer access control policies;hyperledger-fabric-based agriculture supply chain;immutability properties;traceability;supply chain participants;business confidentiality concerns;permissioned blockchain;multiple access control models;multiple layers;complex business relation-ships;blockchain-based consortium;on-chain business logic execution;smart contract layer;hierarchical access control models;NIST's access control rule logic circuit simulation;Fabric configuration management","","","","29","IEEE","14 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A secured loan offers some form of collateral in return and possibly borrow without any collateral to back the loan (unsecured loan). It all depends on the lender’s requirements. The borrowers can pay installments on time or equal to the guarantees provided. The excellent borrowers’ candidate is very influential in lending activities to minimize financial losses and damage their reputation. Most borrowers are rejected because they are unable to pay back the loan. In this paper, we propose a DApp lending architecture design.

To satisfy this requirement, users need to specify in their transactions how much gas fees (in terms of gas limit and gas price) they would like to pay for. In essence, these gas fees are paid to the miners in return for their computational services. Naturally, miners tend to maximize their profits by considering the transactions with higher gas fees, and as a result, the transactions with lower gas fees remain in the waiting pool for a long time. This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach to predict whether a transaction with offered gas fees is likely to be included in the blockchain within the expected time or not. Such prior prediction of transactions' waiting time definitely assists users to reset their gas fees accordingly.

One of the most widely used execution engines is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). EVM performance is a key determinant of the overall blockchain system. Being able to gather detailed insights into EVM performance characteristics is essential not only when implementing EVMs, but also when designing and dimensioning blockchain-based information systems. Today, there is no precise and easy-to-use solution to gather such information. To address this issue, we introduce EVM-Perf, a high-precision EVM evaluation, and analysis framework. Our framework allows detailed performance analysis of arbitrary EVM implementations. Unlike previous work, it leverages statical analysis methods to achieve higher levels of accuracy. We provide an open-source implementation of EVM-Perf and use it to conduct extensive performance analysis for different physical machines. It comprises both machines with x86_64 as well as ARMv8 instruction set architecture. We discuss how EVM-Perf supports system architects with machine selection as well as configurations of Ethereum deployments, e.g., determining Gas limits or block intervals.","","978-1-6654-3578-9","10.1109/ICBC51069.2021.9461058","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9461058","Blockchain;Performance Analysis;Microbench-marking;Ethereum;EVM","Instruction sets;Conferences;Smart contracts;Blockchain;Virtual machining;Performance analysis;Cryptocurrency","blockchains;contracts;information systems;instruction sets;microprocessor chips;parallel architectures;software performance evaluation;transaction processing;virtual machines","EVM-Perf;high-precision EVM performance;smart contract execution engines;implementing EVMs;blockchain-based information systems;high-precision EVM evaluation;blockchain transaction processing;Ethereum virtual machine;machine selection;ARMv8 instruction set architecture;system architects","","","","13","IEEE","24 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Digital documents seem to address some of these challenges, but because of the use of the Internet and reliance on third parties to share and preserve such documents, the privacy and integrity of the digital documents became difficult to maintain. The blockchain technology that Satoshi Nakamoto has proposed for financial transactions can be used to solve the problems of trust in centralized systems and the subversion and alteration thatthese transactions may be exposed to. Blockchain-based systems have shown their effectiveness and ability to solve most security problems related to exchanging systems' transactions. Hence,A decentralized system for exchanging digital documents, using Ethereum blockchain and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), has been proposed to overcome the problems of using trusted third-parties in exchanging digital documents. The proposed system provides immutable and irreversible logs of the process of sending and receiving documents. In this framework, all registered users can encrypt the documents using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Algorithm, send, and receive documents using the Ethereum Blockchain's smart contract. The framework was simulated locally using Ganache Blockchain and tested on the official Ethereum test network Ropsten, and the experimental results showed the feasibility of the proposed scheme. The smart contract used in the Ethereum blockchain was written in the Solidity programming language, and the website that was needed to interact with the blockchain was built using React and other different javascript libraries like web3. Additionally, Metamask wallet was used to create the Ethereum accounts which are required to connect and communicate with the Smart Contract that is implemented in the Ethereum blockchain. Finally, the model's results indicated that the model may cost an average of 0.0552$ per transaction, and this shows that the system is affordable. Also, the model has satisfied the three main security requirements which are confidentiality, integrity, and availability by using the suitable countermeasure for each one of them.","","978-1-6654-3897-1","10.1109/ICECCE52056.2021.9514253","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9514253","AES;Smart contract;Ethereum blockchain;IPFS","Privacy;Computer languages;File systems;Smart contracts;Libraries;Blockchains;Internet","blockchains;data privacy;document handling;electronic data interchange;file organisation;transaction processing;trusted computing","Ethereum Blockchain;digital document exchange;document privacy;decentralized system;interplanetary file system;trusted third-parties;document encryption;advanced encryption standard algorithm;Ganache Blockchain;Solidity programming language","","","","10","IEEE","27 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The ground station server then provides the collected data to the peer-to-peer cloud server (P2PCS) network after converting them into encrypted transactions in a secure way. Finally, the blocks are created from the encrypted transactions and added into a blockchain by applying consensus algorithms implemented by the P2PCS network.

In the first case, we characterize the competitive equilibrium of the spot market, and show that it is socially optimal. Economic orthodoxy advocates spot markets, but these require expensive infrastructure and regulatory blessing. In the second case, we characterize competitive equilibria and compare its efficiency with the idealized spot market. Options contract are private bilateral over-the-counter transactions and do not require regulatory approval. We show that the optimal social welfare is, in general, not supported. We then design optimal option prices that minimize the social welfare gap.

However, the data in such systems suffer from various challenges such as security, reliability, and convenience, to name a few. Traditional systems are not useful to meet these critical issues because these systems have not a consistent structure for data security and reliability policies. Therefore, a new solution is required to enhance data accessibility and should regulate government security policies to ensure the accountability of the usage of the medical records system. Moreover, it is also required to analyze historical data of veterinary clinic using data mining and machine learning techniques to predict the future appointments scheduling requests, which is essential for veterinary management to drive better future decisions, for instance, future demands of medical supplies and to plan veterinary medical staff, etc. This paper aims to fill the gap by proposing a novel blockchain-based reliable and intelligent veterinary information management system (RIVIMS) using smart contract and machine learning techniques. The proposed RIVIMS consists of two main modules; blockchain-based secured veterinary information management, data and predictive analytics modules. First, a blockchain-based secure and reliable veterinary clinic information management system is developed using Hyperledger Fabric. Second, a smart contract enabled data, and predictive analytics modules are developed using permissioned blockchain framework. The data and predictive modules aim to analyze veterinary clinic patients appointments data in order to discover underlying patterns and build a robust prediction model using machine learning algorithms. The data and predictive helps veterinary management to drive better future business decisions to provide better healthcare services to veterinary patients. Hyperledger Caliper is used as a benchmark tool to evaluate the performance of the developed blockchain-based system in terms of transaction per second, transaction success rate, transaction throughput, and transaction latency. Furthermore, machine learning performance measures have utilized, such as MAE, RMSE, and R2 score to evaluate the overall performance of the prediction model.

The flexible reducing expected cost of LEC, which is integrated into the presented model, is the demand response program (DRP). Also, to accommodate the uncertain nature of the output powers of RESs, demand, and electricity market price, a hybrid information-gap decision theory (IGDT)-stochastic approach is proposed in the current work. Finally, a case study is considered to apply the proposed mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model and then investigate the presence of DRP in both risk-averse strategy (RAS) and risk-seeker strategy (RSS) for the LEC taken problem. Simulation results are obtained from CPLEX solver under GAMS optimization software indicate the potentiality and effectiveness of the introduced approach.","2572-6927","978-1-6654-0165-4","10.1109/SGC54087.2021.9664164","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9664164","Large electricity consumer (LEC);renewable energy sources (RESs);demand response program (DRP);bilateral contracts (BCs);risk-averse strategy (RAS);risk-seeker strategy (RSS);uncertainty modeling","Procurement;Renewable energy sources;Costs;Simulation;Stochastic processes;Software;Wind turbines","decision theory;demand side management;integer programming;power markets;pricing;procurement;renewable energy sources","consumer energy procurement optimization;hybrid IGDT-stochastic approach;multienergy procurement sources;MEPS;renewable energy sources;RES;demand response program;DRP;electricity market price;hybrid information-gap decision theory-stochastic approach;mixed-integer linear programming model;GAMS optimization software;large electricity consumer problem;LEC;total operation cost;TOC;decision-maker;pool market;bilateral contracts;MILP;risk-averse strategy;RAS;risk-seeker strategy;RSS;CPLEX solver","","","","21","IEEE","6 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Cryptocurrencies with Security Policies and Two-Factor Authentication","F. Breuer; V. Goyal; G. Malavolta",KIT; CMU and NTT; MPI-SP,"2021 IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (EuroS&P)","4 Nov 2021","2021","","","140","158","Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies offer an appealing alternative to Fiat currencies, due to their decentralized and borderless nature. However the decentralized settings make the authentication process more challenging: Standard cryptographic methods often rely on the ability of users to reliably store a (large) secret information. What happens if one user's key is lost or stolen? Blockchain systems lack of fallback mechanisms that allow one to recover from such an event, whereas the traditional banking system has developed and deploys quite effective solutions. In this work, we develop new cryptographic techniques to integrate security policies (developed in the traditional banking domain) in the blockchain settings. We propose a system where a smart contract is given the custody of the user's funds and has the ability to invoke a two-factor authentication (2FA) procedure in case of an exceptional event (e.g., a particularly large transaction or a key recovery request). To enable this, the owner of the account secret-shares the answers of some security questions among a committee of users. When the 2FA mechanism is triggered, the committee members can provide the smart contract with enough information to check whether an attempt was successful, and nothing more. We then design a protocol that securely and efficiently implements such a functionality: The protocol is round-optimal, is robust to the corruption of a subset of committee members, supports low-entropy secrets, and is concretely efficient. As a stepping stone towards the design of this protocol, we introduce a new threshold homomorphic encryption scheme for linear predicates from bilinear maps, which might be of independent interest. To substantiate the practicality of our approach, we implement the above protocol as a smart contract in Ethereum and show that it can be used today as an additional safeguard for suspicious transactions, at minimal added cost. We also implement a second scheme where the smart contract additionally requests a signature from a physical hardware token, whose verification key is registered upfront by the owner of the funds. We show how to integrate the widely used universal two-factor authentication (U2F) tokens in blockchain environments, thus enabling the deployment of our system with available hardware.","","978-1-6654-1491-3","10.1109/EuroSP51992.2021.00020","NSF(grant numbers:1916939); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9581244","Cryptocurrencies;Blockchain;Cryptography","Performance evaluation;Costs;Smart contracts;Authentication;Banking;Hardware;Blockchains","banking;cryptographic protocols;data privacy;electronic money;entropy","Standard cryptographic methods;secret information;user;blockchain systems lack;fallback mechanisms;traditional banking system;cryptographic techniques;security policies;traditional banking domain;blockchain settings;smart contract;funds;two-factor authentication procedure;exceptional event;particularly large transaction;key recovery request;account secret-shares;security questions;2FA mechanism;committee members;securely implements such a functionality;efficiently implements such a functionality;low-entropy secrets;threshold homomorphic encryption scheme;verification key;blockchain environments;blockchain-based cryptocurrencies;appealing alternative;Fiat currencies;decentralized nature;borderless nature;decentralized settings;authentication process","","","","39","IEEE","4 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of every ten medicines are either fake otherwise don’t follow standard of drugs in developing countries and making the situation worse there. It is very tough to standardize safety regulation of medicines because of the rise of internet pharmacies. Counterfeited drug passes through various distributed complex networks. So, it is hard to detect the counterfeited medicines. For distributed complex networks, the fake drugs get chance to get into the genuine drug supply chain. The security of the drug supply chain has become the utmost concern of public health sector. To get drug supply chain records which are secure, a drug management system is developed using Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain platform in this work. This developed system solves the problem by performing transactions of drug records on a blockchain platform to create a digital, smart drug supply chain. To limit the access to electronic drug records, a smart contract is launched. A flexible android application for manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies and consumers have been made to increase the traceability of the drug.","","978-1-6654-3843-8","10.1109/ACMI53878.2021.9528238","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9528238","Blockchain;Hyperledger fabric;Pharmacology;Counterfeit","Drugs;Distributed ledger;Supply chains;Smart contracts;Complex networks;Developing countries;Fabrics","blockchains;drugs;health care;Internet;pharmaceutical industry","Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain platform;digital drug supply chain;smart drug supply chain;electronic drug records;comprehensive drug management system;Internet pharmacies;public health sector;drug supply chain records;blockchain technology","","","","14","IEEE","8 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Further, the range of CPS applications comprising IoT suffers from various challenges, including robustness, trust, data breach, availability, single point of failure, and interoperability because of the existing centralized architecture. Therefore, incorporating decentralized technology such as blockchain is required to overcome the CPS challenges and ensure immutability, fault tolerance, and consistency using the consensus mechanism and smart contract implementation. In this context, this paper provides a systematic review of blockchain and CPS incorporating IoT. The provided survey is divided into three categories such as security, privacy, and trust.

Fine-grained access control (AC) is important for further applications. Although attribute-based encryption (ABE) schemes can achieve fine-grained AC, almost all schemes distribute a private key to a visitor by a private key generator that may leak data. Besides, attribute revocation functions of the ABE scheme will lead to collusion attacks. Blockchain-based ABE schemes rarely consider ciphertext-based search and attribute revocation functions which lead to a large communication overhead. In this paper, we propose a secure ABE scheme in which a data owner is the only person who has the right to distribute keys. Then we combine blockchain with the proposed ABE scheme to realize fine-grained AC over a distributed storage system, which supports the attribute change function and resists collusive attacks. In addition, we build a series of smart contracts to ensure the fairness of trade between the data owner and visitor. The auxiliary information of data stored on the blockchain can realize ciphertext-based search. Finally, we prove the scheme resists collusion attacks under the computational Diffie-Hellman assumption (CDH) and conduct multiple experiments based on Ethernet test Network. The experimental results demonstrate our scheme has the running time of algorithms reached a millisecond-level and the ET H cost is acceptable.","","978-1-6654-1236-0","10.1109/SWC50871.2021.00054","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9604428","decentralized storage system;access control;blockchain","Data privacy;Technological innovation;Costs;Smart cities;Smart contracts;Resists;Ethernet","authorisation;blockchains;computer network security;data privacy;local area networks;private key cryptography;public key cryptography","blockchain-based fine-grained access data control scheme;attribute change function;distributed storage system;serious data confidentiality;privacy issues;fine-grained access control;attribute-based encryption schemes;fine-grained AC;private key generator;revocation functions;blockchain-based ABE schemes;secure ABE scheme;data owner;collusive attacks;collusion attacks","","","","33","IEEE","18 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Meanwhile, existing UBI solutions rely on a centralized entity (i.e., the insurance company) to manage insurances. In this article, we design a decentralized and privacy-preserving UBI scheme, called DUBI, based on the blockchain technology and zero-knowledge proof. In our scheme, a smart contract running over the blockchain serves as a “decentralized” insurance company, while drivers continuously upload their committed driving data to the blockchain. Periodically, the driver submits accumulated driving statistics with a zero-knowledge proof to the smart contract, which verifies the proof and calculates the insurance premium from the submitted statistics. We formulate an ideal functionality for DUBI under the universal composability framework, and then provide a formal security proof for DUBI. Furthermore, we give in-depth analysis and performance evaluation for DUBI with an implementation based on Ethereum. It shows that DUBI is highly efficient in processing UBI insurances in both storage and computation: DUBI is about seven times more efficient than existing schemes in storage, and proof generation and verification take only 7 and 30 ms, respectively.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.3028014","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972229,61832012); Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:ZR2019MF007); Fundamental Research Funds of Shandong University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9210591","Blockchain;insurance;pay-as-you-drive;privacy","Insurance;Vehicles;Contracts;Companies;Privacy","blockchains;contracts;cryptographic protocols;data privacy;insurance","blockchain technology;zero-knowledge proof;smart contract;decentralized insurance company;committed driving data;formal security proof;UBI insurances;scalable decentralized privacy-preserving usage;traditional insurance schemes;usage-based insurance;insurance premium calculation;serious privacy breach;decentralized privacy-preserving UBI scheme;DUBI;time 7.0 ms;time 30.0 ms","","7","","23","IEEE","1 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Mass data have become a valuable asset, which creates a new business pattern called data trading. However, fairness becomes a challenge when conducting online data trading between participants who are not fully trusted by each other. That is, if a data seller sends the data before being paid, a data buyer might obtain the data without paying, and conversely if a data buyer pays before receiving the data, the data seller might not send the data contractually. Traditionally, a trusted third party is usually employed to settle the disputes between buyers and sellers, but this centralized party is vulnerable to the single-point-of-failure issue. Fortunately, Blockchain provides an approach to realizing data trading without centralized trusted third parties. In this article, we introduce Fairtrade, a decentralized fair data trading framework, to solve the challenges of data availability and trading fairness in decentralized data trading. We propose two different models with potential instantiations. In the first solution, we take advantage of homomorphic encryption and data sample techniques to improve the reliability of the system, and further guarantee the availability of the data during data trading.

In this paper, we introduce a new cryptographic primitive, namely: blockchain-based proxy re-encryption with equality test. Specifically, the proposed approach is designed to achieve reliable matching results by leveraging smart contracts, as well as efficient data sharing and privacy-preserving by combining the function of public-key encryption with equality test and proxy re-encryption. We also implement a prototype of the proposed approach and evaluate its performance with those of three other competing approaches. A comparative summary with three other competing approaches demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves all four features (i.e., decentralization, flexibility, non-interaction, and re-encryption).

Designing smart solutions near the end users allows them to handle some of these requests, meet their QoS requirements, and reduce the load on the network infrastructure, which improves resource management. This article proposes a data management solution using multiple cooperative drones that fly close to the end users and provide advanced features as edge devices to store, handle, or forward data. A cloud server monitoring the area will predict users' behavior with the long short-term memory deep-learning-based model, and send a replication of the most requested data to the drones. Due to the limited storage capacity of drones, the replicated data is distributed between them based on location and computation load. In such systems that are managed by one entity, trust between the various components is highly important. Thus, all communications between the drones and the crowds are executed using smart contracts. The article highlights the benefits of the proposed model, as well as the emerging issues and challenges.","2471-2833","","10.1109/MCOMSTD.0001.2000039","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9696280","","Computational modeling;Smart contracts;Quality of service;Telecommunication traffic;Predictive models;Servers;Resource management","autonomous aerial vehicles;cloud computing;learning (artificial intelligence);quality of service","trustworthy cooperative UAV-based data management;densely crowded environments;massive events;network infrastructure;simultaneous offloading requests;heavy network traffic;QoS-related issues;designing smart solutions;end users;QoS requirements;resource management;data management solution;drones;edge devices;cloud server;short-term memory;requested data;replicated data;computation load;smart contracts;emerging issues","","3","","15","IEEE","28 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Agri-trade involves the buying and selling of products that have been produced through farming industries. Online auction is defined as a process where the buyers and sellers can come on an integrated platform and are allowed to bid in a fixed time frame. Decentralized Blockchain-based e-auction system increases auction security and efficiency and transforms the auction process by eliminating intermediaries. With centralized auction, where websites or platforms gather bids and calculate auction outcomes, it is difficult to build confidence among sellers, buyers, and auctioneers. This system lacks transparency, anonymity, and hence prove to be untrustworthy. So, a broad architecture for decentralized auctions that are used to track and trace bids to execute the transactions safely and securely between the seller and the buyers without the involvement of untrusted third parties, is needed. In this work, we give a complete overview of auction systems using blockchain technology. Then the work uses solidity-based smart contracts deployed on Ethereum test network for executing decentralized, privacy preserving auction system. This system enhances the efficiency and safety of trade and supply of agricultural products and is referred to as an Agro auction system using Blockchain.

In the V2V scheme, the privacy of both charging and discharging EVs including location, time, and amount of power are preserved. To preserve privacy in both schemes, EVs are anonymous, however, a malicious EV may abuse the anonymity to launch Sybil attacks by pretending as multiple non-exiting EVs to launch powerful attacks such as Denial of Service (DoS) by submitting multiple reservations/offers without committing to them, to prevent other EVs from charging and make the trading system unreliable. To thwart the Sybil attacks, we use a common prefix linkable anonymous authentication scheme, so that if an EV submits multiple reservations/offers at the same timeslot, the blockchain can identify such submissions.

The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Over the years, supply chains have evolved from a few regional traders to globally complex chains of trade. Consequently, supply chain management systems have become heavily dependent on digitisation for the purpose of data storage and traceability of goods. However, current approaches suffer from issues such as scattering of information across multiple silos, susceptibility of erroneous or untrustworthy data, inability to accurately capture physical events associated with the movement of goods and protection of trade secrets. Our work aims to address above mentioned challenges related to traceability, scalability, trustworthiness and privacy. To support traceability and provenance, a consortium blockchain based framework, ProductChain, is proposed which provides an immutable audit trail of product's supply chain events and its origin. The framework also presents a sharded network model to meet the scalability needs of complex supply chains. Next, we address the issue of trust associated with the qualities of the commodities and the entities logging data on the blockchain through an extensible framework, TrustChain. TrustChain tracks interactions among supply chain entities and dynamically assigns trust and reputation scores to commodities and traders using smart contracts. For protecting trade secrets, we propose a privacy-preservation framework PrivChain, which allows traders to keep trade related information private and rather return computations or proofs on data to support provenance and traceability claims. The traders are in turn incentivised for providing such proofs. A different privacy-preservation approach for decoupling the identities of traders is explored in TradeChain by managing two ledgers: one for managing decentralised identities and another for recording supply chain events. The information from two ledgers is then collated using access tokens provided by the data owners, i.e., traders themselves.","","978-1-6654-0424-2","10.1109/PerComWorkshops51409.2021.9431136","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9431136","blockchain;data privacy;supply chain;protection of trade secrets","Supply chains;Conferences;Blockchain;Computer security;Scalability;Privacy;Pervasive computing","blockchains;contracts;data integrity;data privacy;production engineering computing;supply chain management;trusted computing","smart contracts;ProductChain;trust scores;privacy-preservation framework;PrivChain;traceability;reputation scores;supply chain entities;supply chain events;blockchain based framework;provenance;trustworthiness;supply chain management systems","","","","","IEEE","24 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As new usecases for internet access emerge, e.g., with the Internet of Things in smart-cities, managing such individual contracts for each deployed device with varying data needs is prohibitively cumbersome and highly expensive. In this work, we enable contract-less connectivity between end-devices and access points/networks that have no a-priori trust relationship. Our core insight is that exchange of services and payments can be trustlessly enforced by distributed ledger technologies; the credentials that blockchains use for account management can also be used for TLS-based authentication in networks. However, the blockchain's ability to enforce transaction rules is limited by the extent to which the underlying exchange of services is digitally trackable, which is susceptible to manipulation in this case. Requiring blockchain-integrated trusted hardware at the access points for bandwidth metering significantly hinders adoption; even software modifications required at the access points to process blockchain-based auth and payments incur practical deployment and scalability challenges. In designing Datanet, we address these challenges and enable seamless and incentivized connectivity between unknown end-devices and APs, using existing standards that allow for interoperability with current and future networks, and without significant overhead for client devices.","2694-2941","978-1-7281-9441-7","10.1109/ICCWorkshops50388.2021.9473502","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9473502","","Performance evaluation;Conferences;Scalability;Authentication;Hardware;Software;Servers","blockchains;contracts;data privacy;Internet;message authentication;open systems;telecommunication security","payments;a-priori trust relationship;contract-less connectivity;deployed device;individual contracts;smart-cities;Internet of Things;connectivity options;internet access;specific network operators;dedicated contracts;internet connectivity;client devices;current networks;unknown end-devices;incentivized connectivity;seamless connectivity;Datanet;scalability challenges;bandwidth metering;requiring blockchain-integrated;underlying exchange;account management;blockchains;distributed ledger technologies","","","","27","IEEE","9 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the on-demand use of energy is considered a big challenge to achieve the optimal cost for households. This paper proposes a blockchain-based predictive energy trading platform to provide real-time support, day-ahead controlling, and generation scheduling of distributed energy resources. The proposed blockchain-based platform consists of two modules; blockchain-based energy trading and smart contract enabled predictive analytics modules. The blockchain module allows peers with real-time energy consumption monitoring, easy energy trading control, reward model, and unchangeable energy trading transaction logs. The smart contract enabled predictive analytics module aims to build a prediction model based on historical energy consumption data to predict short-term energy consumption. This paper uses real energy consumption data acquired from the Jeju province energy department, the Republic of Korea. This study aims to achieve optimal power flow and energy crowdsourcing, supporting energy trading among the consumer and prosumer. Energy trading is based on day-ahead, real-time control, and scheduling of distributed energy resources to meet the smart grid’s load demand. Moreover, we use data mining techniques to perform time-series analysis to extract and analyze underlying patterns from the historical energy consumption data. The time-series analysis supports energy management to devise better future decisions to plan and manage energy resources effectively. To evaluate the proposed predictive model’s performance, we have used several statistical measures, such as mean square error and root mean square error on various machine learning models, namely recurrent neural networks and alike. Moreover, we also evaluate the blockchain platform’s effectiveness through hyperledger calliper in terms of latency, throughput, and resource utilization. Based on the experimental results, the proposed model is effectively used for energy crowdsourcing between the prosumer and consumer to attain service quality.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3060457","Energy Cloud Research and Development Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) by the Ministry of Science, and ICT (MSIT)(grant numbers:2019M3F2A1073387); Institute for Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP) Grant by the Korean Government through MSIT (AutoMaTa: Autonomous Management framework based on artificial intelligent Technology for adaptive and disposable IoT)(grant numbers:2018-0-01456); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9358144","Energy trading;energy prediction;predictive analysis;machine learning;blockchain","Blockchain;Smart contracts;Predictive models;Crowdsourcing;Machine learning;Peer-to-peer computing;Energy consumption","","","","86","","85","CCBY","19 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, decision-making requires a model of several interdependent operators and of EVs’ both driving and charging behaviors. Such a model is suggested for the electrical system in the context of commuting, which has a typical trilevel structure. At the lower level of the model, a congestion game between different types of vehicles gives which driving paths and charging stations (or hubs) commuters choose, depending on travel duration and energy consumption costs. At the middle level, a Charging Service Operator sets the charging prices at the hubs to maximize the difference between EV charging revenues and electricity supplying costs. These costs directly depend on the supplying contract chosen by the Electrical Network Operator at the upper level of the model, whose goal is to reduce grid costs.

The history of agriculture in India starts from Indus Valley Civilization. But in such a historical country, many farmers are starving for their income while foreign countries are earning lakhs from the same. One of the reasons for the above cause is the very poor supply chain management. It is a well-known fact that most of the farming items decay very fast if not maintained properly. In the existing supply chain management, though the government provides storage houses for the farmers, the farmers could not track the status of their goods. Also, there is no proper system for tracking the status of their goods in the various stages of transportation. Hence, an improved supply chain management is needed with the desired properties such as checkpoints at every stage in the supply chain management, verification of goods status by both the farmers and the government officials. In this paper, a system is proposed that uses Blockchain technology to attain the transparency about the goods' status that leads to a healthier relationship between the producer and consumer. By storing the details in the blockchain, all the process is visible both to the farmers and officials involved in the transportation. Also, the records that are immutable can remain forever.","","978-1-7281-9537-7","10.1109/ICAIS50930.2021.9395867","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9395867","Blockchain;smart contract;farmer;supply chain management;goods","Supply chain management;Government;Transportation;Blockchain;Agriculture;History;Investment","agriculture;government policies;public libraries;socio-economic effects;supply chain management","farmers;foreign countries;poor supply chain management;farming items decay;existing supply chain management;proper system;improved supply chain management;goods status;uses Blockchain technology;Blockchain based solution;indian agriculture;India;agriculture-based country;Indus Valley Civilization;historical country","","9","","19","IEEE","12 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In other words, blockchain and smart contract enable evolving existing Internet services and applications to decentralised versions. With the developments of versatile Internet applications, the QoS requirements can be very different. For example, new-age applications such as AR/VR can be quite sensitive to even millisecond delays. End-to-end transaction latency in blockchain is a critical factor that affects the performance of DApps. It is the time duration from sending out a transaction (from the client) to having the transaction recorded on the chain. In this paper, we experimentally evaluate the end-to-end latency in Ethereum and discuss the factors that may affect latency on the Ethereum main-net. It has a particular focus on the gas price because it is a key parameter controlled by users.

Such clients and devices rely on a view of the blockchain provided by full nodes acting as gateways. However, gateway nodes sometimes can provide a distorted view of the blockchain that makes lightweight clients vulnerable to the eclipse attack. When under such an attack, a client cannot differentiate between a forked view of the blockchain and the legitimate blockchain ledger leading to fatal consequences and huge losses incurred. In this paper, we propose a data attestation solution that employs full nodes as validators to attest the responses reported by gateways of lightweight nodes. We leverage smart contracts to give lightweight clients confidence in the data reported as they are unable to validate it from the blockchain network themselves. The system governs the attestation process that comprises submitting attestation requests, approving them, recording the response of validators, and manage payments. Clients can, thereafter, provide their feedback about the validator/gateway performance in the form of a reputation score. We present the proposed system architecture and describe its implementation on the Ethereum blockchain network. We evaluate the proposed solution with respect to functionality testing, cost of execution, and security analysis of the developed smart contracts.

This makes them vulnerable to attacks such as Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, Single Point of Failure (SPF), and fraudulent record modification. In this paper, we propose a fully decentralized electronic voting application, SEVA, in which we placed the whole application (code and data) in Ethereum to protect the application from vulnerabilities.

BCOOL relies on the heterogeneity of Machine Learning, Software-Defined Networks and Network Function Virtualization that is customized in three hybrid cloud/edge-based On/Offchain smart contract modules and ruled by an efficient and reliable communication protocol. BCOOL's first novel module aims at managing message and vehicle trustworthiness using a novel, dynamic and hybrid Blockchain Fog-based Distributed Trust Contract Strategy (FDTCS). The second novel module accurately and proactively predicts the occurrence of congestion, ahead of time, using a novel Hybrid On/Off-Chain Multiple Linear Regression Software-defined Contract Strategy (HOMLRCS). This module presents a virtualization facility layer to the third novel K-means/Random Forest-based On/Off-Chain Dynamic Service Function Chaining Contract Strategy (KRF-ODSFCS) that dynamically, securely and proactively predicts VNF placements and their chaining order in the context of SFCs w.r.t users' dynamic QoS priority demands. BCOOL exhibits a linear complexity and a strong resilience to failures. Simulation results show that BCOOL outperforms the next best comparable strategies by 80% and 100% reliability and efficiency gains in challenging data congestion environments. This yields to fast, reliable and accurate congestion prediction decisions, ahead of time, and optimizes transaction validation processing time. Globally, the Byzantine resilience, complexity and attack mitigation strategies along with simulation results prove that BCOOL securely predicts the congestion and provides real-time monitoring, fast and accurate SFC deployment decisions while lowering both capital and operational expenditures (CAPEX/OPEX) costs.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3070023","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9391673","Blockchain;congestion prediction;random forest;K-means;machine learning (ML);network function virtualization (NFV);software-defined networks (SDN);quality of service (QoS);VANETs","Blockchain;Protocols;Vehicle dynamics;Reliability;Quality of service;Contracts;Safety","blockchains;control engineering computing;learning (artificial intelligence);protocols;quality of service;regression analysis;software defined networking;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;vehicular ad hoc networks;virtualisation","Byzantine resilience;hybrid on/off-chain multiple linear regression software-defined contract strategy;FDTCS;hybrid blockchain fog based distributed trust contract strategy;on-offchain smart contract modules;BCOOL system;software defined networks;trustworthy Blockchain congestion prediction systems;next generation vehicular networks;dynamic service function chaining;novel Blockchain congestion control architecture;attack mitigation strategies;accurate congestion prediction decisions;reliable congestion prediction decisions;fast congestion prediction decisions;data congestion;chaining order;reliable communication protocol;efficient communication protocol;network function virtualization;machine learning","","11","","94","CCBY","31 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Efficient workload allocation and user-centric utility maximization are studied to optimize the network-wide task scheduling. In dynamic environment, offloading destination of each task is determined in a probabilistic manner. When necessary, the offloading service provider represents an offloading user to design a contract based incentive mechanism for the PVs.

However, the majority of existing ride-sharing services rely on a central third party to organize the service, which make them subject to a single point of failure and privacy disclosure concerns by both internal and external attackers. Moreover, they are vulnerable to distributed denial of service (DDoS) and Sybil attacks launched by malicious users and external attackers. Besides, high service fees are paid to the ride-sharing service provider. In this paper, we propose a decentralized ride-sharing service based on public Blockchain, named B-Ride. B-Ride enables drivers to offer ride-sharing services without relying on a trusted third party. Both riders and drivers can learn whether they can share rides while preserving their trip data, including pick-up/drop-off location, departure/arrival date and travel price. However, malicious users exploit the anonymity provided by the public blockchain to submit multiple ride requests or offers, while not committing to any of them, in order to find a better offer or to make the system unreliable. B-Ride solves this problem by introducing a time-locked deposit protocol for a ride-sharing by leveraging smart contract and zero-knowledge set membership proof. In a nutshell, both a driver and a rider have to show their good will and commitment by sending a deposit to the blockchain. Later, a driver has to prove to the blockchain on the agreed pick-up time that he/she arrived at the pick-up location on time. To preserve rider/driver privacy by hiding the exact pick-up location, the proof is performed using zero-knowledge set membership proof. Moreover, to ensure fair payment, a pay-as-you-drive methodology is introduced based on the elapsed distance of the driver and rider.

However, the miscellaneous transaction data on the public blockchain incurs an extra burden on computing and communication overhead, which hinders its application for IoT devices. Additionally, the demands of rapid response in industrial IoT scenarios (e.g., edge computing scenarios) is hardly realized under a public blockchain. In this brief, we propose an IoT-applicable access control model under an original double-layer blockchain architecture, in which the mortgage/registration and control processes can be disaggregated. Depending on this architecture, the communication overhead for IoT devices is reduced and a rapid response is achieved. With linear secret sharing scheme, attribute-based access policies for resource objects are established to ensure fine-grained access control. We further implement a smart contract prototype on Ethereum and Fisco Bcos.

IoT devices are vulnerable, so vendors update and distribute firmware. At the time of firmware distribution, a huge number of IoT devices may connect to the firmware server and excessive network traffic may occur. Consequently, a method using a peer-to-peer file sharing system and a blockchain has been proposed. One study proposed an update scheme considering incentives for distributors to help with updating. However, this method requires the IoT devices, which have limited processing power, to decrypt encrypted files, and the distribution nodes to pay the transaction cost. This paper proposes a firmware distribution method that provides incentives for distributors to help with distribution to reduce the gas costs, using a smart contract and access control based on update records. The additional computations performed by IoT devices and distributors key management were reduced compared to those in previous studies by using access control instead of encryption. Further, the proposed approach was implemented and evaluated using a Raspberry Pi and laptop. The evaluation demonstrated that the gas cost per update was successfully lowered compared to the costs in previous studies.","","978-1-7281-7534-8","10.1109/DSC49826.2021.9346265","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9346265","Blockchain;IoT;firmware management;smart contract","Access control;Performance evaluation;Smart contracts;Telecommunication traffic;Peer-to-peer computing;Internet of Things;Microprogramming","authorisation;cryptography;firmware;Internet of Things;peer-to-peer computing","update scheme;updating;IoT devices;firmware distribution method;update records;efficient blockchain-based IoT firmware update considering distribution incentives;Things devices;vendors update;firmware server;peer-to-peer file","","3","","13","IEEE","10 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence data access control and their enforcement mechanisms become even more critical in the NDNs. In this paper, we propose a novel encryption-based data access control scheme using Role-Based Encryption (RBE). The inheritance property of our scheme provides a natural way to achieve efficient data access control over hierarchical content. This in turn makes our scheme suitable for large scale real world content-centric applications and services such as Netflix. Further, the proposed scheme introduces an anonymous signature-based authentication mechanism to reject bogus data requests nearer to the source, thereby preventing them from entering the network. This in turn helps to mitigate better denial of service attacks. In addition, the signature mechanism supports unlinkability, which is essential to prevent leakages of individual user's access patterns. Another major feature of the proposed scheme is that it provides accountability of the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) using batch signature verification. Moreover, we have developed a transparent and secure dispute resolution and payment mechanism using smart-contract and blockchain technologies. We present a formal security analysis of our scheme to show it is provably secure against Chosen Plaintext Attacks.

Then, the retrieval of evaluation data is implemented by designing and deploying smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Since it is almost impossible to change any data stored in blockchain and IPFS, the proposed PEM system can protect the comment data from intentional or unintentional modifications. Moreover, the proposed PEM system allows users to efficiently and reliably retrieve the relevant evaluation data of a certain product by a given query keyword with the increase of data stored on the blockchain. In addition, to achieve high sustainability, the proposed system also contains an economic incentive mechanism, which is beneficial to form a virtuous circle in online shopping.

Other solutions that do not rely on a TTP have a relatively high computation and communication overhead. Blockchains have allowed the creation of TTP-free protocols for fair exchange; however, the existing Blockchain-based protocols are either too expensive or do not meet the necessary fairness and confidentiality guarantees. In this work, we have developed two TTP-free Blockchain-based protocols for certified electronic mail that achieve the required security properties of strong fairness, non-repudiation, timeliness, and confidentiality. The first protocol uses simple bitcoin transactions for a single receiver, whereas the second one implements smart contracts for one or multiple receivers.

We present a generic system architecture with a deployment on Hyperledger Fabric using the NIST Next Generation Access Control (NGAC) for deciding access to the protected resources on the blockchain.","","978-1-6654-3156-9","10.1109/COINS51742.2021.9524248","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9524248","Attribute-Based Access Control;Blockchain;Hyperledger Fabric;Policy Machine;Smart Contract","Access control;Distributed ledger;Databases;Smart contracts;Systems architecture;NIST;Fabrics","authorisation;blockchains;computer crime","blockchain network;access control mechanism;NIST Next Generation Access Control;attribute-based access control;permissioned blockchain;cyber-attack;blockchain systems;policy machine","","","","24","IEEE","2 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Communication can be established either through cooperative devices or non-cooperative devices. Cooperative devices relay the information to the weak user, but the non-cooperative behavior of some intermediate nodes leads to malicious activities like fraud, misguide, and data-threat. In non-cooperative communication, the source node directly transmits data to the destination node (with a direct link) to eliminate the intermediate nodes for higher trust. But, such communications are vulnerable to various security and privacy threats such as spoofing, data modification, etc. due to the long-distance coverage of signal from source to destination. To overcome these security issues, this paper proposes a blockchain-based trusted network for non-cooperative D2D communication in a heterogeneous network, FaitH. Here, the devices are communicating via a secured blockchain network, where all the involved peer devices validate each transmission of data. Blockchain records each activity performed by any D2D node in communication. It helps to detect the malicious behavior of any D2D user. Each device is connected to a smart contract having some predefined rules. FaitH ensures secure, trusted, and reliable communication over traditional systems.","","978-1-6654-2534-6","10.1109/ECAI52376.2021.9515132","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9515132","Device-to-device communication;blockchain;non-cooperative;smart contract","Wireless communication;Data privacy;Smart contracts;Peer-to-peer computing;Device-to-device communication;Blockchains;Security","blockchains;cooperative communication;mobile radio","FaitH;trusted chain network;device-to-device communication;rapid data transmission;noncooperative behavior;intermediate nodes;malicious activities;data-threat;source node;destination node;direct link;privacy threats;data modification;blockchain-based trusted network;heterogeneous network;secured blockchain network;blockchain records each activity","","","","17","IEEE","23 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is a very complex and distributed process that comes with a set of challenges like scalability, synchronization and trust between the involved parties. The increase in adoption of Radio-frequency Identification (RFID) based systems in the healthcare supply chain shows that RFID technology is a very promising technique for traceability, identification and communication. However, these RFID systems still face issues of privacy and security which need to be addressed to get their full benefit. In this research work, we have integrated RFID systems belonging to the Healthcare supply chain with secure decentralized storage such as Blockchain. Blockchains provides a secure and transparent decentralized mechanism that is used to keep track of all transactions. It offers a new kind of implementation focused on trust, transparency, and accountability. Information about the RFID enabled medicines and other Healthcare products can be added to our proposed framework via a blockchain-based decentralized application (Dapp). The proposed system is based on an Ethereum node, and this information can be stored in a Blockchain using multi-stage interfaces provided by the Smart Contract. Our proposed system has been deployed both on an offline and online environment, and it offers many advantages like monitoring and tracing of medicine through the Blockchain network, determining if the medicine is genuine or counterfeit, and reducing the number of counterfeit and unapproved medicine entering the Healthcare system.

These devices are typically vulnerable to a wide range of cybersecurity attacks, attempting to manipulate sensing data. Most of these disastrous attacks would remain undetected since neither healthcare servers nor Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors are aware of the existence of attackers in the middle of communication. Thus, there is a need for a verification framework that various authorities can request a verification service for the local network data of a target IoT device. In this article, we leverage blockchain as a distributed platform to realize an on-demand verification scheme. This allows authorities to automatically transact with connected devices for witnessing services. A public request is made for witness statements on the data of a target IoT that is transmitted on its local network, and subsequently, devices (in close vicinity of the target IoT) offer witnessing service. Our contributions are threefold: 1) we develop a system architecture based on blockchain and smart contract that enables authorities to dynamically avail a verification service for data of a subject device from a distributed set of witnesses which are willing to provide (in a privacy-preserving manner) their local wireless measurement in exchange of monetary return; 2) we then develop a method to optimally select witnesses in such a way that the verification error is minimized subject to monetary cost constraints; and 3) finally, we evaluate the efficacy of our scheme using real Wi-Fi session traces collected from a five-storeyed building with more than thirty access points, representative of a hospital. According to the current pricing schedule of the Ethereum public blockchain, our scheme enables healthcare authorities to verify data transmitted from a typical wearable device with the verification error of the order 0.01% at cost of less than $ 2 for 1-hr witnessing service.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3051433","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9321470","Blockchain;data witnessing;Internet of Things (IoT);optimization","Medical services;Blockchain;Wireless sensor networks;Wearable sensors;Distributed databases;Wearable computers;Internet of Things","blockchains;body sensor networks;health care;Internet of Things;recording;security of data;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","Ethereum public blockchain;healthcare authorities;wearable device;healthcare IoT data;blockchain logging contract;wearable sensors;health service providers;cybersecurity attacks;healthcare servers;Internet-of-Things sensors;local network data;IoT device;on-demand verification scheme;connected devices;smart contract;Wi-Fi session traces;IoT sensors","","11","","53","IEEE","13 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a case study, we carry out an analysis in terms of quantifying the risk associated to a multi-layered Blockchain framework for Smart Mobility Data-markets (BSMD). We first construct an actor-based analysis to determine the impact of the attacks. Then, a scenario-based analysis determines the probability of occurrence of each threat. Finally, a combined analysis is developed to determine which attack outcomes have the highest risk. In the case study of the public permissioned BSMD, the outcomes of the risk analysis highlight the highest risk factors according to their impact on the victims in terms of monetary, privacy, integrity and trust.

Cross-chain interoperability represents the ability for one blockchain network to interact and share data with another blockchain network. Contemporary cross-chain interoperability solutions are centralized and require re-engineering of the core blockchain stack to enable inter-communication and data sharing among heterogeneous blockchain networks. In this paper, we propose an application-based cross-chain interoperability solution named appXchain which allows blockchain networks of any architecture type and industrial focus to inter-communicate, share data, and make requests. Our solution utilizes the decentralized applications as a distributed translation layer that is capable of communicating and understanding multiple blockchain networks, thereby delegating requests and parameters among them. The architecture uses incentivized verifier nodes that maintain the integrity of shared data facilitating them to be readable by the entities of their network. We define and describe the roles and requirements of major entities of inter-operating blockchain networks in the context of healthcare.

This paper takes the intelligent transportation sensor network as an example and proposes a blockchain-based Internet of Vehicles (IoV) data secure sharing scheme (called IoVChain), which implements automatic registration, rapid authentication, and reliable sharing method of IoV data through smart contract. The smart contract performs homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proof processing on the sensitive part of the data, and this part exists in the form of ciphertext on the blockchain. We adopt PBFT consensus mechanism to ensure the consistency of the entire network ledger, and all the IoV data processing and usage procedure is stored in the Merkle-tree-based block, which cannot be tampered with. Compared with the centralized IoV data management solution, the IoVChain scheme avoids the risk of single point of failure, and keeps the IoV data credible, available, and tamper-resistant under the premise of privacy and security, so that the data can be traced when needed. We have implemented the IoVChain scheme based on the consortium blockchain for trusted and secure sharing of IoV data.

In order to assign a cost to smart contract and transaction execution, the Ethereum Blockchain adopts a gas-based metering approach which is designed to motivate miners to operate the network and protect it against attacks. More precisely, miners receive fees from all transactions included in the mined block in addition to the mining reward. Hence, the higher the gas price in the transactions, the higher the fee paid to the miner will be, resulting in faster selection and execution of higher priced gas transactions. Therefore, an Ethereum transaction sender is exposed to the non-trivial task of having to choose an optimal gas price, as underpaying likely results in a transaction not being picked by miners, whereas overpaying leads to superfluous costs. This paper provides recommendation approach that proposes an appropriate gas price to users. More precisely, it investigates different approaches of forecasting algorithms applied for gas price predictions for the next block in Ethereum Blockchain. The gas price is predicted using the Prophet model and the deep learning models, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). It also aims to compare these approaches with the most used gas price oracles. An evaluation of the obtained results show that the LSTM and GRU proposed models outperform Prophet model as well as the gas price oracle Geth. In this case, LSTM and GRU provide a low mean squared error (MSE) of 0,008 whereas Geth gives an MSE of 0.016 and Prophet gives an MSE of 0.014.","0730-3157","978-1-6654-2463-9","10.1109/COMPSAC51774.2021.00033","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9529485","Blockchain;Ethereum;Gas Price oracle;machine learning;Gas Mechanism","Deep learning;Machine learning algorithms;Costs;Smart contracts;Predictive models;Logic gates;Prediction algorithms","data mining;financial data processing;learning (artificial intelligence);mean square error methods;neural nets;pricing;recurrent neural nets","higher priced gas transactions;Ethereum transaction;optimal gas price;miner;recommendation approach;appropriate gas price;gas price prediction;Ethereum Blockchain;Prophet model;deep learning models;gas price oracles;gas price oracle Geth;blockchain-based platform;global computational infrastructure;smart contract;gas-based metering approach;fee;mined block;faster selection","","4","","22","IEEE","9 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The integral part of any smart contract is the validation of the stake-holder identity, in general, while ideally being achieved without the third-party involvement. Recent industrial research works introduce the sovereign-identity system, where Blockchain becomes a decentralized component to establish a self-certified identity and to avoid a centralized trust third party. Hence, the classification of distributed transactions with respect to identity validation across several users becomes more challenging, especially because of the massive and sensitive identities that are issued through many users and IoT devices and that are used to validate transactions. In this context, it is important to identify and classify the malicious and non-malicious types of transactions. Our proposed method achieves the target of identity classifications from variety of transaction data. Since different users may have different device usage patterns, the data samples and labels located on any individual device may follow a different distribution, which cannot represent the global data distribution. Therefore, the solution could be bi-focal to compensate the gap. This paper coins the approach of hybridizing the consensus where as to initiate a machine learning mechanism to collect the local data globally through a permission driven and a federated approach. We introduce here a Federated Reinforcement learning to be improvised for distributed independent data as a policy of consortium while binding the proof of consensus more centrally authenticated.","2325-5609","978-1-6654-4005-9","10.1109/HPSR52026.2021.9481851","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9481851","","Smart contracts;Distributed databases;Blockchain;Reinforcement learning;Switches;Routing;Proof of Work","blockchains;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence)","IoT devices;identity classifications;transaction data;device usage patterns;data samples;global data distribution;machine learning;distributed independent data;identity management;hybrid blockchain;decentralized applications;Blockchain components;security frameworks;vertical applications;smart contract;stake-holder identity;third-party involvement;industrial research works;sovereign-identity system;decentralized component;self-certified identity;centralized trust third party;distributed transactions;identity validation;massive identities;sensitive identities;secured payment methods;federated-inverse-reinforcement learning","","2","","20","IEEE","15 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Oracle is proposed to serve as a data feed to offer authenticated and deterministic external data to smart contracts. However, existing centralized oracles are efficient but vulnerable to targeted attacks and suffering from a single point of failure, while existing decentralized oracles are inefficient. The paper presents a trusted blockchain oracle based on a decentralized Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) network called Tora, which embraces both efficiency and availability. The key of Tora is a hybrid consensus mechanism with the confidential available group selection based on Proof-of-Availability (PoA). We have implemented a prototype of Tora on Ethereum with Intel Software Guard eXtensions (SGX) and evaluated it with a data-fetch use case on different measurements, including gas costs, off-chain execution time, group selection results and throughput. The results show that Tora provides considerable efficiency and scalability.","","978-1-6654-3479-9","10.1109/JCC53141.2021.00016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9566165","blockchain;oracle;TEE","Limiting;Scalability;Smart contracts;Prototypes;Throughput;Time measurement;Software","blockchains;security of data;software architecture;trusted computing","Tora;trusted blockchain oracle;decentralized TEE network;smart contracts;data feed;authenticated data;oracles;data-fetch use case;decentralized trusted execution environment network;Proof-of-Availability;PoA;software guard eXtensions;SGX","","2","","20","IEEE","13 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The effectiveness of these guidance systems can be greatly affected by data integrity attacks such as GPS Spoofing and Sensor Deception attacks. This vulnerability can be detrimental to users and is difficult to mitigate with the increasing number of adversaries and targeted global attacks. Additionally, it must be stable and consistent because of the sensitive data that it holds. Due to its nature, ITS impacts other users - even those not part of the system - as they affect traffic efficiency and road safety. Thus, a Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consortium blockchain-based ITS with smart contracts was implemented. Using a co-simulation of MATLAB and NS3 through MEX bindings, an ITS simulation model was developed. Two types of data integrity attacks, namely GPS Spoofing and Sensor Deception, were integrated into the co-simulation. Afterward, data was gathered across different scenarios. The implemented blockchain-based system mitigated the data integrity attacks implemented and overall improved the security of the system. The smart contracts and consensus algorithm of the blockchain were able to filter malicious packets in the traffic. Together with the preserved ledger, collisions were prevented and stoppages were lessened.","2163-0771","978-1-7281-7254-5","10.1109/APCC49754.2021.9609851","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9609851","intelligent transportation system;blockchain;security and privacy protection;data integrity attack;mitigation scheme","Data integrity;Smart contracts;Transportation;Hazards;Road safety;Real-time systems;Topology","blockchains;computer network security;data integrity;intelligent transportation systems;Matlab;multi-agent systems;road safety;road traffic;software fault tolerance;traffic engineering computing","data integrity attacks;intelligent transportation system;route guidance systems;GPS spoofing;sensor deception attacks;practical Byzantine fault tolerance;blockchain-based system;ITS;PBFT;smart contracts;MATLAB;MEX bindings;consensus algorithm;NS3","","","","14","IEEE","19 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a system built on consensus, the correctness of a blockchain heavily relies on the consistency of states between its nodes. But consensus protocols of blockchains only guarantee the consistency in the transaction sequence rather than nodes’ internal states. Instead, nodes must replay and exe-cute all transactions to maintain their local states independently. When executing transactions, any different execution result could cause a node out-of-sync and thus gets isolated from other nodes.After systematically modeling the transaction execution process in blockchains, we present a new attack INCITE, which can lead different nodes to different states. Specifically, attackers could invoke an ambiguous transaction of a vulnerable smart contract, utilize software bugs in smart contracts to lead nodes that execute this transaction into different states. Unlike attacks that bring short-term inconsistencies, such as fork attacks, INCITE can cause nodes in the blockchain to fall into a long-term inconsistent state, which further leads to great damages to the chain (e.g., double-spending attacks and expelling mining power). We have discovered 7 0day vulnerabilities in 5 popular blockchains which can enable this attack. We also proposed a defense solution to mitigate this threat. Experiments showed that it is effective and lightweight.","2641-9874","978-1-6654-0325-2","10.1109/INFOCOM42981.2021.9488749","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9488749","","Conferences;Smart contracts;Computer bugs;Earth Observing System;Software;Blockchains;Cryptocurrency","blockchains;cryptographic protocols","INCITE;vulnerable smart contract;node internal states;cryptocurrency;blockchain inconsistency attack mitigation;long-term inconsistent state;fork attacks;short-term inconsistencies;transaction execution process;node out-of-sync;local states;transaction sequence;consensus protocols;tamper-proof medium;software bugs","","","","20","IEEE","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, the operation of Local 5G operator (L5GO) networks or private 5G networks are a viable option to tackle this challenge. A L5GO network is a localized small cell network which can offer tailored service delivery. The adaptation of network softwarization in 5G allows vertical owners to deploy and operate L5GO networks. However, the deployment of L5GOs raises various issues related to management of subscribers, roaming users, spectrum, security, and also the infrastructure. This paper proposes a blockchain-based platform to address these issues. The paper introduces a set of blockchain-based modularized functions such as service rating systems, bidding techniques, and selection functions, which can be used to deploy different services for L5GOs.

On the power supply side, thermal units can reduce the outputs at load valley period through two-stage deep peak regulation. Besides, the penetration rate of electric vehicles (EVs) is also increasing rapidly all over the world.

Such patients require physiotherapy interventions to recover their lost motion capabilities. With the increasing number of such patients, there is also an ever-increasing demand on physiotherapists. Hence, there is a need for physiotherapy assistive devices that will reduce the burden on the physiotherapists and allow them to cater to a larger number of patients. One such requirement is to provide assistance for knee flexion and extension. Soft actuators present a novel solution for developing such devices. We propose a novel, low-profile (5 mm), contractile vacuum actuator that, is lightweight (2 g), can provide a high force-to-weight ratio (230), with an effective force of 4.5 N. This proposed actuator comprises an airtight pouch made of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) fabric with a helical spring skeleton. Once the air inside the pouch is evacuated, the actuator contracts longitudinally along the spring. This single actuator is combined to fabricate multi-actuator configurations of 3- and 5- actuators capable of producing 8 N and 14 N respectively. Both the single and multi-actuator configurations are experimentally evaluated to obtain isometric, isotonic, and isobaric performance characteristics. A numerical model is also developed to predict the multi-actuator isometric performance. The multi-actuator configurations were combined to evaluate the performance in a model leg extension test setup. The proposed actuators were able to lift a 0.8 kg leg model by 17° in extension at a vacuum pressure of 40 kPa (abs.)","","978-1-7281-7713-7","10.1109/RoboSoft51838.2021.9479255","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9479255","","Legged locomotion;Knee;Actuators;Wearable computers;Force;Skeleton;Fabrics","actuators;biomechanics;bone;handicapped aids;medical robotics;muscle;orthopaedics;patient rehabilitation;patient treatment;springs (mechanical)","physiotherapy assistive devices;knee flexion;soft actuators;high force-to-weight ratio;thermoplastic polyurethane fabric;single actuator;multiactuator configurations;multiactuator isometric performance;model leg extension test setup;multiactuator development;knee extension;total knee replacement;lower-limb motion impairments;physiotherapy interventions;lost motion capabilities;contractile vacuum actuator;size 5.0 mm;mass 2.0 g;mass 0.8 kg;pressure 40.0 kPa","","1","","18","IEEE","12 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence, security solutions such as conditional privacy-preserving authentication (CPPA) protocols have been proposed. However, CPPA protocols are generally far from being ready for deployment in VANETs, for example due key/certificate management limitations in PKI-based protocols or intractable private key updating in ID-based protocols. Although serveral blockchain-based CPPA (BCPPA) protocols have been proposed to mitigiate these challenges, there still exist some intractabilities such as revoking private key, or frequent interactions, or requiring an idea hardware. Thus, in this paper, we are motivated to propose a novel BCPPA protocol without these existing issues. Specifically, we present a PKI-based solution (using a typical digital signature protocol, such as ECDSA) based on Ethereum (a public blockchain), which is designed to facilitate secure communication in VANETs. In other words, we combine the blockchain technology and a key derivation algorithm to realize an effective certificate management. This reduces the need for participating vehicles to store a large number of private keys. To reduce the verification time cost, our BCPPA suppotrs replacing ECDSA with modified ECDSA for batch verification or directly adopting other PKI-based signatures with batch verification. In addition to introducing the concrete design, we also present the security requirements that our BCPPA protocol can satisfy. We then implement BCPPA in the Ethereum test network (i.e. Rinkeby) and provide simulations using VanetMobiSim and NS-2 to show its feasibility (i.e. milliseconds).","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2020.3002096","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972294,61932016); Cloud Technology Endowed Professorship; National Science Foundation CREST(grant numbers:HRD-1736209); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9129751","Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET);conditional privacy-preserving authentication (CPPA);key derivation algorithm;blockchain;smart contract","Protocols;Blockchains;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Authentication;Privacy;Smart contracts","blockchains;cryptographic protocols;data privacy;digital signatures;private key cryptography;public key cryptography;vehicular ad hoc networks","blockchain-based conditional privacy-preserving authentication protocol;vehicular ad hoc networks;driver safety;traffic mangement efficiency;privacy-preserving authentication protocols;PKI-based protocols;intractable private key;ID-based protocols;PKI-based solution;digital signature protocol;public blockchain;secure communication;blockchain technology;key derivation algorithm;certificate management;Ethereum test network;BCPPA protocol;blockchain-based CPPA protocols;VANET","","53","","43","IEEE","30 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

BATS uses AI algorithms such as eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to classify the disease with their criticality score ranging from 0 to 1. Moreover, BATS uses UAVs to transport light-weight healthcare items such as medicines and surgical tools in an emergent situation (during surgical procedures) to avoid road-traffic congestions. Results show that the proposed BATS scheme achieves better prediction accuracy, high throughput when the number of users increases, extremely low packet loss ratio, low storage cost, high mining profit, and low bandwidth consumption by the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) compared to the traditional HaBiTs and AaYusH schemes.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2020.3043262","Visvesvaraya Ph.D. Scheme for Electronics and IT; Department of Electronics and Information Technology; Ministry of Communications and Information Technology(grant numbers:MEITY-PHD-2828); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9286685","Unmanned aerial vehicles;6G;telesurgery;blockchain;smart contract;healthcare 4.0;artificial intelligence.","Surgery;Blockchains;6G mobile communication;Artificial intelligence;Hospitals;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Telemedicine;Smart contracts;Medical services","autonomous aerial vehicles;blockchains;computer network reliability;data mining;diseases;health care;medical robotics;mobile radio;surgery;telemedicine","blockchain;artificial intelligence;robotic surgery;AI-empowered telesurgery system;trustable system;ultra-reliable low-latency communication;AI algorithms;extreme gradient boosting;BATS scheme;packet loss ratio;InterPlanetary File System;drone-assisted telesurgery system;XGBoost","","24","","27","IEEE","8 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Fair payment, a candidate solution, can potentially facilitate fair trading among outsourcing computation participants such as users and workers. However, most existing solutions including traditional e-cash-based or blockchain-based, may potentially compromise the worker's fairness (i.e., does not achieve robust fairness, since trusted third parties are required during the trading process), or involve heavy zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs, with significant computation costs). To mitigate these limitations, we propose a system model of an optimized blockchain-based fair payment (OBFP) for outsourcing computations. Then, we construct a ZKP-free solution based on blockchain by combining any secure commitment, accumulator, and symmetric encryption schemes, as well as a hash function. To demonstrate the utility of our proposed OBFP system, we provide security analysis, performance evaluation and a comparison with existing popular solutions. Specifically, the cryptographic tools are instantiated as commitment (Perdesen commitment), accumulator (RSA-based accumulator), and symmetric encryption (a concrete scheme with the indistinguishability under chosen-plaintext attack (IND-CPA) security), and a hash function (Keccak-256).

First, to present the possible ways in which DoS/DDoS attacks can be mounted on NSB and their adverse effects. Second, to propose and implement initial blockchain-based solution named as Security Service Blockchain (SSB) to prevent DoS attacks on NSB. Third, to enumerate the challenges and future research directions to effectively utilize blockchain for mitigating DoS/DDoS attacks on NSB. To evaluate the performance the proposed SSB framework is implemented using Hyperledger Fabric. The results manifest that the latency impact of the legitimate slice creation over scaled up malicious traffic remains minimal with the use of SSB framework.

Although they are simple, user-friendly, and broadly adopted, they offer insecure authentication and position server operators as trusted parties, giving them full control over users’ identities. To mitigate these limitations, many identity systems have embraced public-key cryptography and the concept of decentralization. All these systems; however, require users to create and manage public-private keypairs. Unfortunately, users usually do not have the required knowledge and resources to properly handle cryptographic secrets, which arguably contributed to the failures of many end-user public-key infrastructures (PKIs). In fact, as of today, no end-user PKI, able to authenticate users to web servers, has a significant adoption rate. In this paper, we propose Password-authenticated Decentralized Identities (PDIDs), an identity and authentication framework where users can register their self-sovereign username-password pairs and use them as universal credentials. Our system provides a global namespace, human-meaningful usernames, and resilience against username collision attacks. A user’s identity can be used to authenticate the user to any server without revealing that server anything about the password, such that no offline dictionary attacks are possible against the password.

This allows Garou to achieve both high-performance and flexibility. If all participants keep online, Garou guarantees all honest users’ balance security against strong adversarial capabilities. To demonstrate the feasibility of the Garou protocol, we develop a proof of concept prototype for the Ethereum network.

Existing data auditing schemes have done a lot of work in terms of functionality, implementation, and security. As we can see, all of these schemes are based on the auditing framework proposed by Ateniese et al., which uses random sampling to probabilistically check whether the data is integrity or not. But multiple repeated sampling may lead to an intersection between the challenge sets selected each time, reducing the probability of detection, and the time for detecting corrupted blocks will be indefinite. If the corrupted data is not found for a long time, the data remedial measures will become invalid, resulting in permanent data loss. To address the above problem, we designed an efficient sampling verification algorithm. Based on this algorithm, the auditing scheme is further optimized, and a dynamic auditing function has been developed for the scheme to facilitate data owners to update data. Through the security analysis, our scheme is soundness.

The top $M$ bidders can buy the goods at the $M+ 1\text{st}$ bidding price. A trusted manager is commonly used to compare these sealed-bids. In our research, trusted manager and trusted mix servers used by mix and match are removed. Instead of cooperating all managers or bidders to find out the winning bidders, winning bidders prove that they are a winner by themself. By further adopt a greedy strategy on searching the $M+ 1\text{st}$-price, the time complexity of each bidder can be reduced to $O(P)$, which is the same as most previous researches. Thus, we construct a scheme that removed the manager without increasing bidders' time complexity. The implementation shows that the gas usage reduced 87% from a manager architecture in a 3 bidder and 6 bidding price setting. The cost to participate in this auction is 12,000, 000P gas or 600P US dollars at this moment, which is enough practical.","2324-9013","978-1-6654-1658-0","10.1109/TrustCom53373.2021.00023","JSPS KAKENHI(grant numbers:JP21H03443); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9724495","$\mathrm{M}+ 1\text{st}$-price auction;blockchain;smart contract;privacy","Privacy;Costs;Conferences;Smart contracts;Computer architecture;Decentralized applications;Robustness","commerce;computational complexity;electronic commerce;pricing","bidder scalable M;1st-price auction;Vickrey auction;sealed-bid auction;$M$ identical goods;b bidders;bidding points;$M$ bidders;M+ 1st bidding price;trusted manager;sealed-bids;winning bidders;manager architecture;6 bidding price setting","","2","","18","IEEE","9 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Attackers can transfer more tokens than the actual allowance through this vulnerability. The current prevention methods for Multiple Withdrawal Attack include changing the transaction process, modifying the API of ERC20, and modifying the implementation of functions, etc. However, these methods have disadvantages such as poor compatibility, incomplete resolution, and high gas consumption. In this paper, we describe the process of Multiple Withdrawal Attack and analyze the shortcomings of the existing methods, and then propose a solution with lower gas consumption. In our method, a variable is added to record the allowance in the approval function to prevent tokens from being transferred repeatedly.

To accelerate blockchains, many works focus on optimizing the mining step while ignoring other steps. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain framework-FastBlock to speed up the execution and validation steps by introducing efficient concurrency. To efficiently prevent the potential concurrency violations, FastBlock utilizes symbolic execution to identify minimal atomic sections in each transaction and guarantees the atomicity of these sections in execution step via an efficient concurrency control mechanism-hardware transactional memory (HTM). To enable a deterministic validation step, FastBlock concurrently re-executes transactions based on a happen-before graph without increasing block size. Finally, we implement FastBlock and evaluate it in terms of conflicting transactions rate, number of transactions per block, and varying thread number. Our results indicate that FastBlock is efficient: the execution step and validation step speed up to 3.0x and 2.3x on average over the original serial model respectively with eight concurrent threads.","2575-8411","978-1-6654-4513-9","10.1109/ICDCS51616.2021.00032","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1005800); NSFC(grant numbers:61802223); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9546505","Smart contract;Transaction;Hardware transaction memory;Concurrent execution","Concurrent computing;Instruction sets;Conferences;Memory management;Smart contracts;Hardware;Concurrency control","blockchains;concurrency control;data mining;graph theory;multi-threading;transaction processing","blockchain lifecycle;mining step;symbolic execution;concurrency control mechanism;deterministic validation step;block size;concurrent threads;FastBlock;hardware transactional memory;happen-before graph","","","","22","IEEE","4 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, we design the first permissioned blockchain-based anonymous and traceable aggregate signature (PBATAS) scheme for IIoT. Smart contracts are used to authenticate anonymous sources and share cryptographic materials among entities, providing reliable regulatory support for IIoT. The regulator can quickly trace the abnormal data sources recorded on the blockchain, which is practical for the anonymous IIoT environment.

A rich variety of contact tracing applications, each offering its own unique set of features, are currently being used to track the spread of the virus from person to person, and isolate/quarantine suspected individuals. However, existing approaches have not been very successful since they lack incentives to motivate users to use them actively. Although each solution provides some form of privacy protection and data security, loopholes do exist, and there is scope for improvement. In this context, we explore the use of blockchain to help in advancing contact tracing applications. In this article, we describe how blockchain could offer enhanced data security and functionality without compromising users' privacy. The effectiveness of contact tracing applications improves with the user base. In this regard, we explore how blockchain-based smart contracts can be used to offer incentives to users at various stages of the contact tracing process. Next, we lay down a plan for future contact tracing frameworks that provide the advantages of blockchain and user incentives, and all the best features available in current solutions.","2576-3199","","10.1109/IOTM.0211.2100002","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9548968","","COVID-19;Data privacy;Pandemics;Data security;Smart contracts;Government;Blockchains;Electronic healthcare","blockchains;data privacy","blockchain-based smart contracts;contact tracing process;user incentives;privacy-preserving;incentivized contact tracing;COVID-19 virus;privacy protection;enhanced data security","","9","","15","IEEE","27 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Conventionally this optimization problem is solved in a centralized manner, limiting the size of the problem that can be solved and creating a high communication overhead because all the data is transferred to the central controller. These limitations are addressed by the proposed distributed consensus-based alternating direction method of multiplier (DC-ADMM) optimization algorithm, which decomposes the optimization problem into subproblems with private cost function and constraints. The distribution feeder is partitioned into low coupling subnetworks/regions, which solves the private subproblem locally and exchanges information with the neighboring regions to reach consensus. The relaxation strategy is employed for mixed-integer and coupled constraints introduced in the optimal power flow (OPF) problem by stationary and transportable BESS because DC-ADMM convergence is only guaranteed for strict convex problems. The information exchange and synchronization between subnetworks/regions are vital for distributed optimization. In this work, both of these aspects are addressed by the blockchain. The smart contract deployed on the blockchain network acts as a mediator for secure data exchange and synchronization in distributed computation. The blockchain-based distributed optimization problem's effectiveness is tested for a 0.5-MW laboratory microgrid for one hour ahead and day-ahead for the IEEE 123-bus and EPRI J1 test feeders, and results are compared with a centralized solution.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3066970","U.S. Department of Energy through the Battelle Memorial Institute(grant numbers:DEAC05-76RL01830); subcontract from Pacific Northwest National Laboratories to the University of Alaska Fairbanks(grant numbers:474633); National Renewable Energy Laboratory; Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC, for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)(grant numbers:DE-AC36-08GO28308); U.S. Department of Energy Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and the Wind Energy Technologies Office; U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, EPSCoR Program; Office of Electricity Microgrid R&D Program; and Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Solar Energy Technology Office(grant numbers:DE-SC0020281); University of Alaska Fairbanks Office of Vice Chancellor for Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9381210","Alternating direction method of multiplier;battery energy storage systems;blockchain;distributed optimization;optimal power flow;microgrid","Optimization;Blockchain;Spinning;Microgrids;Distribution networks;Convex functions;Smart contracts","battery storage plants;blockchains;convex programming;distributed power generation;distribution networks;integer programming;load flow;minimisation;power generation scheduling;power grids","private subproblem;coupled constraints;optimal power flow problem;DC-ADMM convergence;strict convex problems;blockchain network;distributed computation;blockchain-based distributed optimization;distributed ADMM;private blockchain;power flow optimization;distribution network;mixed-integer constraints;optimization problem;battery energy storage systems;power grid;energy consumption;multiplier optimization algorithm;private cost function;distribution feeder;distributed consensus-based alternating direction method of multiplier optimization algorithm;smart contract;laboratory microgrid;power 0.5 MW","","7","","65","CCBY","18 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

They can be used to exchange valuable data relevant to a community, such as data relevant to traffic, road conditions, parking, air quality and other urban internet of things (IoT) applications, in a scalable manner. Traditionally, online marketplaces use ratings by buyers to help potential consumers identify good quality products; however such rating systems are often easy for sellers to game by paying for flattering ratings and reviews. These problems are even more challenging in data marketplaces due to the possibility of sellers launching Sybil attacks (taking on multiple fake identities) to rate their own products. We propose a novel decentralized crypto-economic system to ensure the credibility of reviews. The key idea of our proposed system, which can be implemented using decentralized smart contracts, is to have sellers apply for their products to be reviewed, followed by an allocation of products to a select subset of reviewers with credibility. The reviewer allocation process is randomized and double-blinded to minimize the possibility of collusion with the seller. The reviewers are incentivized through a mechanism that not only provides a reward for reviewing products posted by sellers but also an additional reward for reviewing test products posted by the marketplace. We analyze the incentive mechanism through game theoretical modeling and show conditions under which the Nash equilibrium policy is for all reviewers to perform the work needed for the review (without guessing at the answer). We also show how the staking mechanism in conjunction with high quality reviews incentivizes sellers to post higher-quality products. A marketplace with higher-quality products, in turn, is likely to have a stronger reputation and attract more customers, helping the entire ecosystem.","","978-1-6654-3578-9","10.1109/ICBC51069.2021.9461149","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9461149","","Analytical models;Roads;Smart contracts;Games;Blockchain;Nash equilibrium;Product design","data privacy;electronic commerce;game theory","decentralized review system;data marketplaces;public data providers;private data providers;data-consuming applications;Internet of Things applications;online marketplaces;rating systems;crypto-economic system;decentralized smart contracts;reviewer allocation process;reviewing products;marketplace","","5","","31","IEEE","24 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Previous studies have indicated that some cryptographic tools can be used to resolve the above issues, but the poor performance makes those techniques difficult to practice. In this paper, we propose a Secure and Fair Double AuCtion framework (named SF-DAC) for cloud virtual machines, which performs cloud auction efficiently while guaranteeing both bid privacy and trade fairness. We design secure 3-party computation protocols that support secure comparison and secure sorting, which enable us to construct a secure double auction scheme that outperforms all prior comparable solutions.

Worldwide, people have had to adapt by undergoing remote work and self-quarantine. This situation has required transforming strategies for various logistics services for a variety of service providers, such as retail stores and restaurants. The concept of contactless delivery has emerged to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. However, contactless delivery only reduces the direct interaction between the delivery personnel and the customer. In addition to peer-to-peer contact, items still go through insecure interactions between and among the delivery personnel and other unknown third parties. Even if the items are delivered without physical contact, concerns remain about their routes in the supply chain. In this paper, we present a novel blockchain-based framework to enable the traceability of products in the supply chain. This framework records and tracks delivery traces and the medical status of delivery personnel in a privacy-preserved manner, ultimately contributing to COVID-19 prevention and control. We build a Hyperledger Fabric-based blockchain prototype system as our testbed. Several smart contract functions are implemented and evaluated to show the efficiency of the proposed framework.

As a result, each application employs its own blockchain solution that cannot exchange information with other applications. Hence, blockchain interoperability has become an important issue, since it allows not only exchanging data among applications but also to offer the possibility of developing multi-blockchain systems. Using multiple blockchains can improve the scalability of the system, which is a fundamental issue in blockchain technology.

However, because user assets are fully accessible by a secret key, decentralized exchanges pose significant internal security risks for trading firms and automated trading systems, where a compromised system can result in total loss of funds. Centralized exchanges mitigate this risk through API key based security policies that allow professional users to give individual traders or automated systems specific and customizable access rights such as trading or withdrawal limits. Such policies, however, are not compatible with decentralized exchanges, where all exchange operations require a signature generated by the owner's secret key. This paper introduces a protocol based upon multiparty computation that allows for the creation of API keys and security policies that can be applied to any existing decentralized exchange. Our protocol works with both ECDSA and EdDSA signature schemes and prioritizes efficient computation and communication. We have deployed this protocol on Nash exchange, as well as around several Ethereum-based automated market maker smart contracts, where it secures the trading accounts and wallets of thousands of users.","","978-1-6654-1760-0","10.1109/Blockchain53845.2021.00038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9680483","Blockchain;MPC;Security;Threshold signatures","Protocols;Computer hacking;Conferences;Smart contracts;Permission;Delays;Cryptocurrency","application program interfaces;cryptocurrencies;cryptographic protocols;digital signatures;private key cryptography","security improvement;decentralized exchanges;multiparty computation;decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges;secret key;significant internal security risks;automated trading systems;API key based security policies;Nash exchange;internal security risks;trading firms;signature generation;Ethereum-based automated market maker smart contracts","","1","","22","IEEE","24 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the increasing popularity of Ethereum, considerable attention has been paid to its privacy and anonymity. Previous work in Ethereum deanonymization mostly focused on the analysis of its transaction graph and user behaviors. In this paper, for the first time we explored the feasibility of deanonymizing Ethereum users based on P2P network analysis. By measurement and analysis, we observed that the attacker can make connections with approximately 90% mainnet synced full nodes. Based on the well-connected supernode, the deanonymization experiments with basic estimators preliminarily indicate that the anonymity of Ethereum P2P network is pretty limited. To further improve the effect of deanonymization, we implemented and evaluated a machine learning based estimator, which reduces the influence of network delay on deanonymization and thus increases the success rate to 88%. At last, we provide the discussion about the anonymity and efficiency of the propagation mechanisms.","","978-1-6654-3574-1","10.1109/ISPA-BDCloud-SocialCom-SustainCom52081.2021.00191","Research and Development; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9644904","Ethereum;Blockchain;Anonymity;P2P network","Privacy;Smart contracts;Network analyzers;Machine learning;Delays;Cryptocurrency;Blockchains","data privacy;financial data processing;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);peer-to-peer computing","practical deanonymization attack;P2P Network Analysis;second-largest cryptocurrency;open-source public blockchain platform;smart contract functionality;Ethereum deanonymization;transaction graph;user behaviors;Ethereum users;P2P network analysis;deanonymization experiments;network delay","","1","","19","IEEE","22 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For the local workers, which are untrusted but economically-rational, to conduct local learning honestly, we propose a TEE-based selective testing scheme that also combines techniques from applied cryptography, game theory and smart contract. Theoretical analysis of the scheme indicates that only a small number of tests are needed to enforce honest execution by the local workers. Implementation-based experiments compare the cost of the proposed scheme against two reference schemes (i.e., the original scheme without security measure and the all-SGX scheme which conducts training completely in an SGX enclave). The results show that, our proposed scheme incurs much lower cost at the SGX enclave though introducing a higher cost at the untrusted execution environment. We argue that this tradeoff is appropriate given that computing in the untrusted environment can access more resources and is cheaper than in the trusted environment. The experiment results also show that, the increase of the cost in the untrusted execution environment get smaller as the size of the training model increases, which demonstrates the scalability of the scheme.","","978-1-6654-0184-5","10.1109/PST52912.2021.9647773","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9647773","","Training;Privacy;Costs;Scalability;Smart contracts;Collaborative work;Servers","cryptography;game theory;learning (artificial intelligence)","federated learning system;central aggregation server;multiple distributed local workers;trusted execution environments;TEE-based selective testing scheme;implementation-based experiments;all-SGX scheme;SGX enclave;untrusted execution environment;cryptography;game theory;smart contract","","1","","18","IEEE","21 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To solve this problem, the enterprises must improve their food supply chain management system. In addition to tracking and storing orders and deliveries, it also ensures transparency and traceability of food production and transportation. This is a big challenge that the food supply chain system using the client-server model cannot meet with the requirements. Blockchain was first introduced to provide distributed records of digital currency exchanges without reliance on centralized management agencies or financial institutions. Blockchain is a disruptive technology that can improve supply chain related transactions, enable to access data permanently, data security, and provide a distributed database. In this paper, we propose a method to design a food supply chain management system base on Blockchain technology that is capable of bringing consumers’ trust in food traceability as well as providing a favorable supply and transaction environment. Specifically, we design a system architecture that is capable of controlling and tracking the entire food supply chain, including production, processing, transportation, storage, distribution, and retail. We propose the KDTrace system model and the Channel of KDTrace network model. The Smart contract between the organizations participating in the transaction is implemented in the Channel of KDTrace network model. Therefore, our supply chain system can decrease the problem of data explosion, prevent data tampering and disclosure of sensitive information. We have built a prototype based on Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain. Through the prototype, we demonstrated the effectiveness of our method and the suitability of the use cases in a supply chain. Our method that uses Blockchain technology can improve efficiency and security of the food supply chain management system compared with traditional systems, which use a clientserver model.","2688-0202","978-1-6654-0639-0","10.1109/ACOMP53746.2021.00008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9668231","Food supply chain;Blockchain;Technology adoption;Traceability","Supply chain management;Supply chains;Smart contracts;Transportation;Systems architecture;Prototypes;Process control","blockchains;client-server systems;financial management;food safety;organisational aspects;production engineering computing;prototypes;quality assurance;security of data;supply chain management;supply chains;sustainable development;tracking","food traceability;food safety;food production;transportation;sustainable food supply chain management system;quality assurance;client-server model;digital currency exchanges;centralized management agencies;financial institution;data security;supply-transaction environment;food supply chain control;smart contract;organizations;KDTrace network model channel;hyperledger fabric blockchain prototype;storing orders;tracking deliveries;distributed database","","1","","16","IEEE","10 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, in the existing blockchain-based cloud storage schemes, distribution of vacant storage is unbalanced while users have various storage demands. This paper first formulates the problem of maximizing total utility for the cloud storage allocation in blockchain network. Then, a blockchain-empowered storage auction mechanism (BEADS) with double-chain structure is proposed, in order to improve the balance and effectiveness of cloud storage.

Many applications focus on exploiting the Blockchain-native features (e.g. trust from consensus, and smart contracts) while paying less attention to the application-specific requirements. In this paper, we initiate a systematic study on the applications in the education and training sector, where Blockchain is leveraged to combat diploma fraud. We first present a general system structure for digitized diploma management systems and identify both functional and non-functional requirements. We then show that all existing Blockchain-based systems fall short in meeting these requirements. Inspired by the analysis, we propose a Blockchain-facilitated solution by leveraging some basic cryptographic primitives and data structures. Our analysis shows that the proposed solution respects all the identified requirements by design and can be further extended to enhance its security and privacy guarantees.

However, the current blockchain data supervision is insufficient and the data cannot be modified once it is on the blockchain, which will cause the blockchain system to face various problems such as illegal information cannot be deleted and breach of smart contract cannot be fixed in time. To address these issues, we propose an anonymous editable blockchain scheme based on the reconstruction of the blockchain structure of the SpaceMint combining with the certificateless aggregate signature algorithm. Users register with their real identities and use pseudonyms in the system to achieve their anonymity. If the number of users who agree to edit meets the threshold, the data on the blockchain can be modified or deleted, and our scheme has the function of accountability for malicious behavior. The security analysis show that the proposed certificateless aggregate signature algorithm enjoys the unforgeability under the adaptive selected message attack. Moreover, the method of setting the threshold of related users is adopted to guarantee the effectiveness and security of editing blockchain data. At last, we evaluate the performance of our certificateless aggregate signature algorithm and related schemes in theoretical analysis and experimental simulation, which demonstrates our scheme is feasible and efficient in storage, bandwidth and computational cost.","","978-1-6654-1411-1","10.1109/ICNLP52887.2021.00016","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9537874","editable blockchain;certificateless aggregate signature;accountability;anonymity","Analytical models;Law;Aggregates;Smart contracts;Natural language processing;Blockchains;Registers","blockchains;digital signatures;telecommunication security","anonymous editable blockchain scheme;blockchain technology;traditional centralized data storage methods;people reliable data storage services;blockchain system;blockchain structure;certificateless aggregate signature algorithm;blockchain data supervision;decentralized features;nontamperable features;illegal information;smart contract;SpaceMint;malicious behavior;adaptive selected message attack","","","","28","IEEE","17 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Distributed energy resources owners who can both produce and consume energy are defined as prosumers. To encourage the peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading between prosumers, blockchain as a thriving technology is utilized in the P2P network due to its transparency, security, and rapidity in executing transactions. Due to its decentralized quality, any intermediaries are eliminated so that transactions happen directly among traders. This article introduces a consortium blockchain trading model to support P2P energy trading, using a proof-of-stake protocol. The pre-selected miners are responsible for compensating the power losses in distribution lines by energy transactions. The specific process of the blockchain establishment, as well as the smart contract creation, are demonstrated. In addition, a type of crypto-currency named “elecoin” is created in the P2P market, which is published by the mining mechanism of the blockchain.

This work proposes a data marketplace, which allows to sell data that can be computed, though not unveiled. First, an owner provides encrypted data to a buyer, who can perform arbitrary operations on this encrypted data as if it were regular data.

For the Ethereum network, on the other hand, we define a bipartite social graph based on the smart contract transactions. A novel community detection algorithm which is designed for low-rank signals on graph can help find users' communities based on user-token subscription. Based on these results, two strategies are devised to deliver on-chain advertisements to those users in the same community. We implement the proposed algorithms on real data. By adopting the modified clustering algorithm, the community results in the Bitcoin network are basically consistent with the ground-truth of the betting site community which has been announced to the public.

Because of this pandemic, the government has issued health protocols that use a lot of COVID-19 tests. However, cases of forgery of test certificates often occur in paper-based test certificate. To overcome this problem, we propose a COVID-19 test certificate management system using blockchain technology. By using blockchain technology, the system can be used by multiple entities, even though the entities that use it do not have trust relationship beforehand. This is possible because blockchain is a technology that uses a decentralized network that can store its data with a secure consensus mechanism. The system built using the Ethereum platform, which is a public non-permissioned blockchain that supports decentralized application development through smart contracts that executed via EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). The system has been developed using 3-layers architecture, which contains network, software, and application layer. The evaluation shows that the system successfully fulfills the COVID-19 test certificate management requirement. The system can be used for tester registration, and create, revoke, display certificates. Furthermore, by using encryption and digital signature mechanism, the system can protect patient privacy and data integrity. The system has also succeeded in fulfilling the availability and security requirements.

At the same time, as more services are integrated, more sensors are introduced into the network. As a consequence, the architecture that manages these sensors need to be improved. Blockchains can be a solution in terms of data security. To cater to the inexpensive devices used as sensors in most IoT-based sensor networks, usually, permissioned blockchains are used as its base data management structure. However, due to the diverse collection of sensors that can be incorporated into a network, a static database is not enough. A more sustainable and automative system is needed as its service administrator. Therefore, we chose to integrate smart contracts to enable adaptive and dynamic automation. Lastly, to manage the reception of all the incoming data, a proper interface is required. Therefore, we chose to encapsulate the blockchain within a REST API to enable a systematic allocation of network resources. With these technologies, we propose a low-cost platform to address the management issues of current IoT-based sensor networks. We tested our design against a commercial REST API service and standard socket communication to test its feasibility. The testing metrics were latency and throughput. Based on the results, our platform proved to be the most stable and proficient among the configurations. Therefore, our proposed design shows promise as a low-cost, secure, and systematic means of managing IoT-based sensor networks.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-8104-2","10.1109/GLOBECOM46510.2021.9685387","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9685387","","Wireless sensor networks;Systematics;Sockets;Smart contracts;Throughput;Time measurement;Blockchains","application program interfaces;Internet of Things;security of data;sensors","automotive system;base data management structure;commercial REST API service;IoT-based sensor networks;IoT-based sensor networks management;low-cost platdform;network resources;permissioned blockchain reinforced API platform;sensors;static database;sustainable system;systematic allocation","","","","21","IEEE","2 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is of great significance for the healthy development of the big data industry to connect data supply-demand and promote data circulation through data trading. However, the existing third-party data trading platforms have the ability to view and steal transaction data and true identity. It has become a potential threat to both parties and an obstacle to data trading. Based on the research of blockchain technology, smart contract, and cryptography technology, this paper proposes a data trading model based on a blockchain for the security of data trading. The model uses the Interstellar File System (IPFS) and zero-knowledge proof to solve the security of data. Firstly, IPFS and cryptography are used to store and access data files safely. Secondly, based on secure storage and access, a data trading request is broadcast to a blockchain network. And the blockchain responds to the transaction request. Then, to obtain the original data file, the ciphertext got from the blockchain is decrypted based on the response message. Finally, the zero-knowledge proof system in the model is used to pay transaction fees to both parties. This process protects the security of payments. Through this model, both parties can complete the data trading. It also protects the security of data. In this paper, the proposed scheme is implemented on the Ethereum platform. The experimental results show that the proposed data trading model performs well in the security of data trading.","","978-1-6654-2621-3","10.1109/ICCSI53130.2021.9736200","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9736200","Blockchain;data trading;IPFS;zero-knowledge proof","Industries;File systems;Smart contracts;Big Data;Data models;Blockchains;Social intelligence","Big Data;blockchains;data privacy","third-party data trading platforms;data files;zero-knowledge proof;transaction data;data circulation;data supply-demand;big data industry;decentralized data trading model;security of data;blockchain;original data file;data trading request","","","","37","IEEE","23 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading mechanism provides a platform where prosumers can participate in energy sharing which is beneficial for all users of MG. Meanwhile, due to the high penetration of RES and distributed generations in distribution system used in P2P energy trading concept, the control and operation of existing grid is lacking the required functionalities. In P2P energy trading, power congestion occurs on distribution system which can limit effective utilization of RES. As RES and power demands are increasing, congestion problem also tends to increase. Smart Metering (SM) infrastructure is used to handle Energy Congestion Problem (ECP) by more effective management of prosumer community in P2P energy trading mechanism. SM monitors power transactions, maintains status of the network and obtains power profiles of prosumers. In this paper, Normalized P2P (NP2P) energy trading scheme is proposed with objective to decrease load on main grid and cost minimization for all users. NP2P is centralized contracting scheme treats all users in Microgrid equal for energy flow and cost implementation. Three different cases are considered to validate efficiency of proposed P2P energy trading scheme. In this research work, ECP due to NP2P model is analyzed, modeled as Knapsack Problem (KP) and solved using Greedy and Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithms. In proposed research, Central Energy Management Unit (CEMU) is responsible for implementation of functions for NP2P model and energy congestion control. To improve the reliability of grid, some prosumers with surplus energy should be disconnected. The results of various considered cases for proposed NP2P scheme and algorithms for ECP are compared to verify effectiveness of the solution.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3124792","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9598827","Peer-to-Peer energy trading;energy congestion;microgrid;smart meter;greedy algorithm;simulated annealing algorithm;Knapsack problem","Microgrids;Costs;Optimization;Renewable energy sources;Power system stability;Peer-to-peer computing;Power markets","costing;distributed power generation;energy management systems;knapsack problems;peer-to-peer computing;power distribution control;power distribution economics;power distribution reliability;power generation control;power generation economics;power generation reliability;power markets;renewable energy sources;simulated annealing;smart meters;smart power grids;telecommunication congestion control","RES;power transaction;cost implementation;Central Energy Management Unit;energy congestion control;distributed generation;microgrid paradigm;peer-to-peer energy trading mechanism;smart metering infrastructure;ECP;knapsack problem;simulated annealing algorithm;system reliability","","4","","49","CCBY","2 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

More seriously, the cloud-based centralized management mode is vulnerable to cyber-attacks, which usually leads to privacy leakage. However, previous studies seldom focus on the privacy issue of the charging system for EVs. In this article, a decentralized and privacy-preserving charging scheme for EVs is proposed, which is based on blockchain and fog computing. In this scheme, fog computing is introduced to provide local computing with low latency. Specifically, a fog computing network, which is composed of fog computing nodes (FCNs), is used to provide localized services. Besides, a flexible consortium blockchain architecture is proposed.

Thus, the vehicles in Vehicles to Infrastructure (V2I) communication over a 5G wireless network have to perform more frequent mutual authentications than before, which will greatly reduce the efficiency of the entire network. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel handover authentication protocol that incorporates the blockchain based smart contracts to remove redundancy in the traditional handover authentication. Our proposed scheme can achieve the mutual authentication and key agreement between vehicles and base stations in 5G wireless networks, while it can largely reduce the cost for the handover authentication at the same time. The formal verification by Scyther indicates that the proposed protocol can resist various malicious attacks. In addition, the performance evaluation results show that the delay incurred by handover authentication can be significantly reduced indicating that the proposed protocol is feasible and holds potential to be used in the deployment of 5G wireless networks.","1938-1883","978-1-7281-7122-7","10.1109/ICC42927.2021.9500334","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9500334","The Fifth Generation (5G) wireless network;Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I);Handover authentication;Blockchain;Smart contract;Scyther","Performance evaluation;Base stations;5G mobile communication;Wireless networks;Authentication;Systems architecture;Resists","5G mobile communication;blockchains;cryptographic protocols;formal verification;message authentication;mobility management (mobile radio);telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","malicious attacks;smart contracts;vehicles to infrastructure communication;V2I communication;key agreement;mutual authentication;handover authentication protocol;base stations;Fifth Generation wireless network;blockchain-assisted seamless handover authentication;5G wireless networks","","4","","11","IEEE","6 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It can be used to run simulations before manufacturing. However, traditional DT platforms lack data privacy, traceability, immutability, authentication of stakeholders. Moreover, manual prediction of the wearing of the tool condition of the CNC machine is challenging. Motivated from these gaps, in this paper, we propose a six-layered architecture for DT of CNC, which predicts CNC tool wear detection using a novel ensemble technique based soft voted prediction model consisting of XGBoost, random forest, and AdaBoost models. The proposed architecture also incorporates the public Ethereum blockchain (BC) to maintain the aforementioned issues of authentication, traceability, and transparency through constraints and automation programmed into the smart contracts (SC) developed. We evaluate the proposed scheme’s performance through simulation and compare it with other traditional approaches concerning several performance parameters (accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall).

The current proof-of-work consensus algorithm used by many blockchain protocols suffer from vulnerabilities such as the majority attacks problem and strip mining. The algorithm often requires specialized application-specific hardware and involves energy-intensive computation, making it an unlikely candidate for power grid applications. On the other hand, the proof-of-stake consensus algorithm is susceptible to the well-known nothing-at-stake vulnerability issue, making it equally unlikely to be used in large-scale secured energy transactions. An energy-efficient locational marginal pricing-based hybrid proof-of-work, proof-of-stake consensus algorithm is proposed to mitigate such risks. The hybrid consensus algorithm uses an optimized market-based energy pricing model to select the mining and forging nodes.

In this article, we propose a novel remote e-voting model for large-scale elections by proposing the participation of two conflicting parties to ensure election integrity and accountability. Our scheme can be implemented in IoT devices such as smartphones, which we believe can significantly increase voter turnout of the election process. Our proposed work is secure and preserves voter privacy through secure multiparty computations performed by parties of differing allegiances. It also leverages a blockchain running smart contracts as a publicly accessible and tamper-resistant bulletin board to permanently store votes and prevent double voting. In our security and privacy analysis, we show that our proposed scheme is secure against potential security threats and provides voter anonymity.

The optical fiber was embedded in a garment and controlled displacements at predefined locations on the garment were applied, where the simultaneous assessment of displacement amplitude and location was obtained using a slope-assisted technique. In the proposed technique, the slope inverses of the transmission-reflection curves are correlated with the displacement applied on the fiber, where a determination coefficient (R2) of 0.996 was obtained. Then, the sloped-normalized reflection (or backscattered) response is used on the disturbance location estimation with relative errors as low as 3.7%. The on-body application tests show an inherent insensitivity of the proposed smart garment to body movement due to natural gait movements, indicating the feasibility of the proposed approach on detecting only the transverse induced mechanical perturbations.

Also, there is a need to analyze the organization’s SLA assignment for any underlying discrepancies in execution of such complex process.

We validated the suitability of our proposed approach for wider scenarios of customer requirements, including for the customers having no technical knowledge about their required services.

The intrusion detection method is employed by a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) deep learning algorithm to deal with sequential network data and is assessed using the data sets of UNSW-NB15 and BoT-IoT. The privacy-based blockchain and smart contract methods are developed using the Ethereum library to provide privacy to the distributed intrusion detection engines. The DBF framework is compared with peer privacy-preserving intrusion detection techniques, and the experimental outcomes reveal that DBF outperforms the other competing models.

However, some users only enjoy the convenient service without uploading or sharing, which is called free riding. Free-riding may discourage other honest users. When free-riding users mount to a certain number, the platform may fail to work. The current available incentive mechanisms, such as reciprocal incentive mechanisms and reputation-based incentive mechanisms, which suffer simple incentive models, inability to achieve incentive circulation and dependence on a third-party trusted agency, are unable to completely solve the free-riding problem.In this paper we build a blockchain-based distributed file sharing platform and design a nested incentive scheme for this platform. The proposed nested incentive mechanism achieves the circulation of incentives in the platform and does not rely on any trusted third parties for incentive distribution, thus providing a better solution to free-riding. Our distributed file sharing platform prototype is built on the current mainstream blockchain. Nested incentive scheme experiments on this platform verify the effectiveness and superiority of our incentive scheme in solving the free-riding problem compared to other schemes.","","978-1-6654-4511-5","10.1109/SmartIoT52359.2021.00019","Research and Development; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9556204","Blockchain;Incentive mechanism;P2P File System","Costs;File systems;Conferences;Smart contracts;Diversity reception;Prototypes;Peer-to-peer computing","incentive schemes;peer-to-peer computing","distributed file sharing system;upload resources;high-quality resources;high-speed download;honest users;free-riding users;reciprocal incentive mechanisms;reputation-based incentive mechanisms;incentive circulation;free-riding problem;incentive distribution;distributed file sharing platform prototype;nested incentive scheme experiments","","","","16","IEEE","12 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because of high safety due to flexibility and simplicity, the artificial muscle is expected to be applied to robots or power assist devices in medical, welfare, and agricultural fields. However, for sensing its state, external sensors such as pressure sensors, potentiometers, or encoders are needed in general. By attaching these rigid and bulky sensors, the advantages of the artificial muscle are diminished. In our study, three kinds of functional fibers are utilized as sleeve fibers.

In traditional swarm robotic applications, where homogeneous robots are utilized, it is possible to replace a robot if it malfunctions, and it can be assumed that all robots are interchangeable. However, in many real-world applications spanning from search and rescue missions to future household robotic appliances, heterogeneous robots will need to work together with the other robots and human agents to achieve specific tasks. Nevertheless, no such system exists. Therefore, we propose a system that utilizes a token economy for robotic agents that makes agents responsive to token acquisition as an incentive for collaboration in achieving a given task. The economy enables the system to self-govern, even under Byzantine and adversarial settings. We further incorporate a novel subcontracting framework within a blockchain environment to allow the robotic agents to efficiently and cost-effectively perform complex jobs requiring multiple agents with various capabilities.

As a distinctive feature, B-RAN enables secure and efficient resource sharing and trading by aggregating, pooling, and coordinating resources from multiple resource hosts and owners across subnetworks. Therefore, an implementable architecture along with various functional modules shall be delicately designed. This work aims to establish a unified architecture with enhanced efficiency, security, compatibility, and flexibility for resource sharing and trading in B-RAN. Specifically, we develop a six-layer architecture that incorporates a number of novel features such as enhanced blockchain structures, secure interaction methods, efficient service mechanisms, and scalable transaction patterns. We design a number of pluggable functional modules in each layer to support diverse functions, services, and applications of resource sharing and trading.

Data can be represented and stored in heterogeneous format. There are chances of attack on information which is vital for particular organization. With rapid increase in cyber crime, attackers behave maliciously to alter those data. But it is having great impact on forensic evidences which is required for provenance. Therefore, it is required to maintain the reliability and provenance of digital evidences as it travels through various stages during forensic investigation. In this approach, there is a forensic chain in which generated report passes through various levels or intermediaries such as pathology laboratory, doctor, police department etc. To build the transparent system with immutability of forensic evidences, blockchain technology is more suitable. Blockchain technology provides the transfer of assets or evidence reports in transparent environment without central authority. In this paper blockchain based secure system for forensic evidences is proposed. The proposed system is implemented on Ethereum platform.

Therefore, the settlement is typically a very long process as there are multiple parties involved. In comparison, parametric insurance insures a policyholder against the occurrence of a specific event by paying a set amount based on the magnitude of the event.We have seen that with digitization, the insurance industries have also been disrupted through the use of innovative insurance schemes, one of them being parametric insurance. In parametric insurance, a fixed amount is paid on an event once a certain threshold is crossed. The amount is determined based on the modeled forecast of the loss.Parametric insurance will help settle the claim process, which currently is challenged with a longer settlement duration and disputes. However, for parametric insurance to work, there is a need for the data providers to capture events and their trust factor. In the new data-driven age, technologies like IoT, API's, and distributed ledgers are the technology enablers to capture real-time events and add a trust factor with the distributed ledger. Though parametric insurance can be implemented with the traditional centralized database approach, it has limitations on trust issues as the data can be manipulated.This paper explores how we can realize trusted digital technology-enabled parametric health insurance. It will deep dive into the technical solution, challenges to design, deploy, and parametric service insurance.

The success or failure of a movie is determined by the box office collection. The box office collection is dependent on various factors like director, actors, actresses, technicians, production house, musicians, marketing, etc. But yet it is highly influenced by the reviews and feedbacks given by the people, critics, media, etc. Due to the latest trends in the marketing field, digital media is used as a form of recommendation system where users read the reviews about a movie, or the ratings rated before making any decision to watch a movie. The existing problem that are identified with these reviews is that nowadays bots are being deployed to increase the reviews, and also fake reviews, negative reviews are also a major concern since most of the reviews are given by people without watching the movies. These problems create huge financial loss to the company, the people associated with it and also the movie industry as a whole. So in order to overcome the existing problems we are considering using blockchain technology as the future of entertainment industry. Since blockchain is a distributed network we can use it to store the reviews given by the user which is nontamperable and this in turn can help rate a movie correctly. Because of the genuine reviews stored in blockchain, movie goers can choose the correct film and make a good film successful thereby increasing the box office collection of the movie.","2329-7190","978-1-7281-5875-4","10.1109/ICCCI50826.2021.9402381","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9402381","Blockchain;ethereum;movie rating;ganache;log","Films;Smart contracts;Entertainment industry;Blockchain;Production;Media;Motion pictures","blockchains;entertainment;information retrieval;Internet;social networking (online)","genuine reviews;movie goers;box office collection;movie rating system;entertainment industry;fake reviews;negative reviews;movie industry;movie success;movie failure;digital media;recommendation system;financial loss;blockchain technology","","1","","8","IEEE","21 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Double Random Phase Encryption (DRPE), known as the typical way of optical encryption, can easily encrypt images. In the decryption process of DRPE, the complex conjugate of random phase mask used as the encryption key in the Fourier domain is used as the decryption key. As a result, computational DRPE has a vulnerability in image transmission when the random phase mask is stolen. Our proposed method utilizes the random function defined by the sender, and it generates additional random variable to multiply the random phase mask. Finally, our proposed method can enhance the security of the encryption process. However, the random phase mask and random variable information generated by random function are needed to decrypt the image.

As a branch of machine learning, classification has been widely adopted in data processing. However, the sensitivity of data raises the concern of data privacy. How to balance data utility and data privacy is a challenging issue. Privacy-preserving data classification, which supports flexible and privacy-friendly access to datasets and data classification, enables users' data to be collected in an authenticated manner. However, the priva-cy-preserving data classification approach has a limitation in that the correctness of data classification cannot be guaranteed. As a consequence, it is possible for a malicious classifier to manipulate the classification result. To solve these problems, in this article, we propose a transparent and accountable privacy-preserving data classification framework, which involves a tracer to assert the behavior of the classifier and maintains the utility and privacy of data. Specifically, we take advantage of cryptography techniques to balance data privacy and data utility, and use blockchain to achieve transparency and accountability for the behavior of the classifier. To illustrate the practicability of this framework, we implement concrete cryptographic algorithms and develop a prototype system to evaluate and test its performance.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.011.2000662","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872229,U19B2021); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9406311","","Data privacy;Blockchain;Cryptography;Smart contracts;Encryption;Public key;Big Data;Machine learning","Big Data;cryptography;data analysis;data privacy;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","data privacy;data utility;accountable privacy-preserving data classification;machine learning;big data analysis;data processing;privacy-friendly access;users;priva-cy-preserving data classification approach;classification result;transparent privacy-preserving data classification","","","","15","IEEE","16 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Hines",NA,"Digital Finance: Security Tokens and Unlocking the Real Potential of Blockchain","","2021","","","117","127","Decentralized Finance will spawn a multitude of innovative new lending products. An entire market for borrowing and lending has been created around cryptocurrency. Today, several leading firms offer cash loans that can be collateralized with crypto or digital assets. One form of funding for these loans comes when lenders pledge cryptocurrencies to earn money. As a result, Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDCoin, or other forms of digital assets can earn interest. Blockchain will help to facilitate nearly every aspect of the structure and maintenance of a loan and its lifecycle. Mortgages are debt instruments which use real estate as collateral. Mortgages have a life cycle and go through multiple stages: the origination, property and title validation, closing, servicing, and securitization. The blockchain will ensure that all necessary steps are taken to complete a fully compliant loan.","","9781119756323","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9893485.pdf&bkn=9887631&pdfType=chapter","","Blockchains;Loans and mortgages;Monitoring;Finance;Distributed ledger;Smart contracts;Regulators","","","","","","","","15 Sep 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The existing Identity management system is not that secure, reliable, distributed and trustworthy. All these systems containing digital information are vulnerable to getting hacked or sometimes act as a malicious entity if the data is altered on central servers. Data breaches, including confidential data, are happening regularly. Blockchain on the other hand is one of the most emerging technologies that has gained a lot of attention in the past 5-6 years. Blockchain can address most of the issues with the existing identity management system. Over few years, various dApps have been created using Blockchain Framework (leveraging PKI system) to solve the problem of Digital Identity Management, but at the same time, most of the work done is compromising the feature of decentralization (systems based on Centralization as Verifiable Credentials / Public-Private Keys are stored in the central server for verification). In this system, the authors have proposed an interoperable blockchain solution for Identity Management. The purpose of this research work is to study the feasibility of whether or not we can use interoperable blockchain solutions for Identity and Access Management. The authors were able to create a PoC for illustrating the same. This system was able to complete the authentication and verification process within 1 second, and all the necessary functions created to test the feasibility was able to execute within 1 second.

Depending on the purpose, it is common to categorize tokens into payment tokens, security tokens and utility tokens. The distinction is of interest since in most jurisdictions, security tokens are more heavily regulated than other tokens. In this paper, we present a heuristic approach towards automatic detection of security tokens from blockchain data. To this end, we first discuss several methods for the (semi-) automatic identification of token contracts. Then we attempt to identify the token type.

There are three companies involved in the research. First is an energy technology company that aims to leverage electric- vehicle batteries through vehicle to grid (V2G) services in order to provide energy storage for electric grids. Second is a defense contracting company that provides acquisition support for the DOD's conventional prompt global strike program (CPGS). These systems need protections in their production and supply chains, as well as throughout their system life cycles. Third is a company that deals with trust and security in advanced logistics systems generally. The rise of interconnected devices has led to growth in systems security issues such as privacy, authentication, and secure storage of data. A risk analysis via scenario-based preferences is aided by a literature review and industry experts. The analysis is divided into various sections of Criteria, Initiatives, C-I Assessment, Emergent Conditions (EC), Criteria-Scenario (C-S) relevance and EC Grouping. System success criteria, research initiatives, and risks to the system are compiled. In the C-I Assessment, a rating is assigned to signify the degree to which criteria are addressed by initiatives, including research and development, government programs, industry resources, security countermeasures, education and training, etc. To understand risks of emergent conditions, a list of Potential Scenarios is developed across innovations, environments, missions, populations and workforce behaviors, obsolescence, adversaries, etc. The C-S Relevance rates how the scenarios affect the relevance of the success criteria, including cost, schedule, security, return on investment, and cascading effects. The Emergent Condition Grouping (ECG) collates the emergent conditions with the scenarios. The generated results focus on ranking Initiatives based on their ability to negate the effects of Emergent Conditions, as well as producing a disruption score to compare a Potential Scenario's impacts to the ranking of Initiatives. The results presented in this paper are applicable to the testing and evaluation of security and risk for a variety of embedded smart devices and should be of interest to developers, owners, and operators of critical infrastructure systems.","","978-1-6654-1250-6","10.1109/SIEDS52267.2021.9483779","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9483779","Hypersonics;Bidirectional Charging;Trust and Security;Electric Vehicle Charging;Enterprise Resilience;Risk Register;Systems Integration","Industries;Training;Vehicle-to-grid;Technological innovation;Supply chains;Companies;Security","critical infrastructures;decision making;defence industry;electric vehicle charging;embedded systems;goods distribution;logistics;military computing;power engineering computing;power grids;production engineering computing;risk analysis;risk management;security of data;telecommunication security","C-S relevance rates;ECG;leverage electric-vehicle batteries;DOD conventional prompt global strike program;criteria-scenario;emergent condition grouping;potential scenario impacts;ranking Initiatives;security countermeasures;research initiatives;system success criteria;emergent conditions;industry experts;literature review;scenario-based preferences;risk analysis;systems security issues;interconnected devices;system life cycles;supply chains;defense contracting company;electric grids;energy storage;grid services;energy technology company;embedded systems;risk management;advanced logistics systems;embedded smart devices;critical infrastructure systems","","","","28","IEEE","16 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To meet this challenge, power generation is shifting towards intermittent renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, leading to an increasing demand for additional flexibility on the side of end consumers who are becoming active participants in electricity markets. These goals imply that traditional electricity suppliers will have to upgrade their services and models or be replaced by a new type of supplier - aggregator. An aggregator will allow end consumers to be active and adaptive through a variety of price signals, such as dynamic pricing, consumption adjustment, reward fees, etc. In this paper, we present an architecture for a platform envisioned as a decentralized market for flexibility service providers in the power system, based on Internet of Things (IoT) and distributed ledger technologies. The platform will enable controllable and verifiable interaction of aggregators with end consumer devices in a trustless environment, as well as functionalities such as secure data exchange, search, history analysis, flexibility, and reputation management.

DApp fingerprinting can identify users' visits to specific DApps by analyzing the resulting network traffic, revealing much sensitive information about the users, such as their real identities, financial conditions and religious or political preferences. DApps deployed on the same platform usually adopt the same communication interface and similar traffic encryption settings, making the resulting traffic less discriminative. Existing encrypted traffic classification methods either require hand-crafted and fine-tuning features or suffer from low accuracy. It remains a challenging task to conduct DApp fingerprinting in an accurate and efficient way. In this paper, we present GraphDApp, a novel DApp fingerprinting method using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We propose a graph structure named Traffic Interaction Graph (TIG) as an information-rich representation of encrypted DApp flows, which implicitly reserves multiple dimensional features in bidirectional client-server interactions. Using TIG, we turn DApp fingerprinting into a graph classification problem and design a powerful GNN-based classifier. We collect real-world traffic datasets from 1,300 DApps with more than 169,000 flows. The experimental results show that GraphDApp is superior to the other state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy in both closed- and open-world scenarios. In addition, GraphDApp maintains its high accuracy when being applied to the traditional mobile application classification.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2021.3050608","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1006101); Beijing Nova Program(grant numbers:Z201100006820006); NSFC Projects(grant numbers:61972039,61932016,61872041); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:4192050); Zhejiang Lab Open Fund(grant numbers:2020AA3AB04); China National Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists(grant numbers:61825204); Beijing Outstanding Young Scientist Program(grant numbers:BJJWZYJH01201910003011); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9319399","Decentralized applications;encrypted traffic classification;deep learning;graph neural networks;blockchain","Blockchain;Servers;Random forests;Mobile applications;Smart contracts;Graph neural networks;Smart phones","client-server systems;cryptography;graph theory;neural nets;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic","closed-world scenarios;open-world scenarios;DApp fingerprinting method;network traffic;political preferences;financial conditions;blockchain platforms;Decentralized Applications;encrypted traffic analysis;application identification;traditional mobile application classification;real-world traffic datasets;graph classification problem;encrypted DApp flows;Traffic Interaction Graph;graph structure;graph neural networks;encrypted traffic classification methods","","48","","29","IEEE","11 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most of them however rely on either public Blockchains (which have low performance) or permissioned blockchains (which have low decentralization level and do not provide byzantine fault tolerance). Moreover, these solutions have limitations when capturing the business model of existing energy trading systems. This article proposes a Unified permissioned blockchain-based P2P-ET Architecture (UBETA) that integrates three different types of energy markets and provides a unified energy trading and payment settlement model. The UBETA system is based on an enterprise Ethereum Blockchain, known as Hyperledger Besu, and Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerance (IBFT) consensus algorithm. We compared the performance of the proposed IBFT-based system with three existing systems (i.e., Ethereum Clique, Ethereum Proof of Work and Hyperledger Fabric's Raft) using specific performance metrics (i.e., read/write transaction latency, read/write transaction throughput and fail rate). The experiments were carried out on a network size of up to 60 nodes and a real energy trading data set from the Western Australian energy market was used. The experiment results indicate that the IBFT-based system has 15x lower latency and nearly 2x throughput compared to existing Proof of Work based P2P-ET solutions. Moreover, the system provides better scalability and success rate than existing Raft based P2P-ET systems: the fail rate of the IBFT-based system only increased by 11% while that of Raft increased by 20% when increasing the number of nodes from 20 to 60. In addition, the proposed unified energy trading model provides lower latency and reduces the number of blockchain transactions compared to the non-unified counterpart.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2021.3056147","Australian Research Council (ARC) Discovery Scheme through the Project “Resource Allocation for High-Volume Streaming Data in Data Centers”(grant numbers:DP200100005); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9344670","Peer-to-peer energy trading;blockchain;smart contracts;security;privacy;performance;scalability","Blockchain;Security;Peer-to-peer computing;Throughput;Scalability;Privacy;Distributed ledger","blockchains;data privacy;electronic money;fault tolerant computing;peer-to-peer computing;power markets;transaction processing","unified energy trading model;blockchain transactions;blockchain-based peer-to-peer energy trading;privacy;fast payment settlement;public blockchains;permissioned blockchains;decentralization level;energy trading systems;Unified permissioned blockchain-based P2P-ET Architecture;UBETA system;enterprise Ethereum blockchain;IBFT-based system;performance metrics;fail rate;energy trading data;Western Australian energy market;Istanbul Byzantine fault tolerance consensus algorithm;security;Hyperledger Besu;IBFT consensus algorithm;Raft based P2P-ET systems;Ethereum Clique;Ethereum Proof of Work;Hyperledger Fabric Raft;read-write transaction latency","","47","","36","IEEE","2 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Blockchain is currently the hottest technology for distributed networks. It solves the consistent issue of distributed data and is used in many areas, such as cryptocurrency, smart grid, and the Internet of Things. Our work discussed the security and privacy challenges of edge computing networks. From the perspectives of data authorization, encryption, and user privacy, we analyze the solutions brought by blockchain technology to edge computing networks. In this work, we deeply present the benefits from the integration of the edge computing network and blockchain technology, which effectively controls the data authorization and data encryption of the edge network and enhances the architecture's scalability under the premise of ensuring security and privacy.

The scheme operates in two phases. In the first phase, based on the area density, and the number of users, UAVs swarms are mounted with thermal imaging sensors that monitor the body temperature of persons. The collected data are sent to ground stations in real-time, through 6G network services. Once, the images are analyzed, the details of potential COVID-19 patients are identified, and their travel and contact records are fetched and stored in BC. Then, in the second phase, the contact-tracing information is validated in BC. The proposed scheme is simulated for smart contracts (SC) functionalities, UAV observations, latency, spectral efficiency, and transaction and signing costs. The obtained results indicate the scheme viability. For example, 6G has a low latency of 330.8 milliseconds (ms), which outperforms 1200.1 ms in fifth-generation (5G) channels. The observed spectral efficiency of 6G channels is 5-10× higher than 5G, and the average signing and transaction cost is 3.473 seconds (s), and 6.873 s respectively, which outperforms the conventional schemes.","","978-1-6654-1450-0","10.1109/ICIEM51511.2021.9445332","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9445332","Blockchain;6G;UAV;Contact Tracing;Data dissemination","6G mobile communication;Temperature sensors;COVID-19;Temperature measurement;Spectral efficiency;5G mobile communication;Surveillance","6G mobile communication;autonomous aerial vehicles;blockchains;contracts;diseases;epidemics;image sensors;infrared imaging;medical image processing;medical robotics;robot vision;surveillance","BloCoV6;blockchain;COVID-19 pandemic;trust-based contact-tracing ecosystem;thermal imaging sensors;6G network services;COVID-19 patients;sixth-generation assisted unmanned aerial vehicle contact tracing;6G-assisted UAV contact tracing;UAV swarms;smart contracts;image analysis;person surveillance","","17","","19","IEEE","4 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Interoperability in EHR aims to devise agreements in its interpretation, access, and storage with security, privacy, and trust. A study and survey of the state-of-the-art literature, prototypes, and projects in standardization of the EHR structure, privacy-preservation, and EHR sharing are very essential. The presented work conducts a systematic literature review to address four research questions. 1) What are the different standards for common interpretation, representation, and modeling of EHR to achieve semantic interoperability? 2) What are the different privacy-preservation techniques and security standards for EHR data storage? 3) How mature is blockchain technology for building interoperable, privacy-preserving solutions for EHR storage and sharing? 4) What is the state-of-the-art for cross-chain interoperability for EHR sharing? An exhaustive study of these questions establishes the potential of a blockchain-based EHR management framework in privacy preservation, access control and efficient storage. The study also unveils challenges in the adoption of blockchain in EHR management with the state-of-the-art maturity of cross-chain interoperable solutions for sharing EHR amongst stakeholders on different blockchain platforms. The research gaps culminate in proposing a blockchain-based EHR framework called as MyBlockEHR with privacy preservation and access control design. The proposed framework employs partitioning of EHR to on-chain and off-chain storages for performance guarantees with the retrieval of valid off-chain data. The framework is deployed on the Ethereum test network with Solidity smart contracts.

In many 5G use cases, network requirements vary over time and CSPs must dynamically adapt network slices to satisfy the contractual network slice QoS, cooperating and using each others’ resources, e.g. when resources of a single CSP are not sufficient or suitable to maintain all it’s current SLAs. While this need for dynamic cross-CSP cooperation is widely recognized, realization of this need is not yet possible due to gaps both in business processes and in technical capabilities.In this paper, we present a 5GZORRO approach to dynamic cross-CSP slice scaling. Our approach both enables CSPs to collaborate, providing security and trust with smart multi-party contracts, and facilitates thus achieved collaboration to enable resource sharing across multiple administrative domains, either during slice establishment or when already existing slice needs to expand or shrink. Our approach allows automating both business and technical processes involved in dynamic lifecycle management of cross-CSP network slices, following ETSI’s Zero-Touch Network and Service Management (ZSM) closed-loop architecture, and relying on resource-sharing Marketplace, Distributed Ledger (DL), and Operational Data Lake. We show how this approach is realized in truly Cloud Naive way, with Kubernetes as both business and technical cross-domain orchestrator.

However, open challenges still exist in dealing with heterogeneous resource sharing, scheduling, and ensuring credibility of service processing. Given this background, this article aims to address the edge-side heterogeneous resource trust management in multi-domain scenarios.

Then, under the proposed architecture, a smart-contract-based resource sharing mechanism is formulated, including an incentive mechanism based on end-side node contribution.

The inherent complexity of such systems can introduce impurities including inaccurate information, lack of transparency and limited data provenance. Counterfeit drugs is one consequence of such limitations within existing supply chains which not only has serious adverse impact on human health but also causes severe economic loss to the healthcare industry. Consequently, existing studies have emphasized the need for a robust, end-to-end track and trace system for pharmaceutical supply chains. Therein, an end-to-end product tracking system across the pharmaceutical supply chain is paramount to ensuring product safety and eliminating counterfeits. Most existing track and trace systems are centralized leading to data privacy, transparency and authenticity issues in healthcare supply chains. In this article, we present an Ethereum blockchain-based approach leveraging smart contracts and decentralized off-chain storage for efficient product traceability in the healthcare supply chain. The smart contract guarantees data provenance, eliminates the need for intermediaries and provides a secure, immutable history of transactions to all stakeholders. We present the system architecture and detailed algorithms that govern the working principles of our proposed solution.

However, offloading mobile tasks to the cloud gives rise to new security issues due to malicious mobile devices (MDs). How to implement offloading to alleviate computation burdens at MDs while guaranteeing high security in mobile edge cloud is a challenging problem. In this paper, we investigate simultaneously the security and computation offloading problems in a multi-user MECCO system with blockchain. First, to improve the offloading security, we propose a trustworthy access control mechanism using blockchain, which can protect cloud resources against illegal offloading behaviours. Then, to tackle the computation management of the authorized MDs, we formulate a computation offloading problem by jointly optimizing the offloading decisions, the allocation of computing resource and radio bandwidth, and smart contract usage. This optimization problem aims to minimize the long-term system costs of latency, energy consumption and smart contract fee among all MDs. To solve the proposed offloading problem, we develop an advanced deep reinforcement learning algorithm using a double-dueling Q-network.

Many traditional methods can be used for this purpose but these methods have limited capabilities. Using these methods the process becomes more complex, slower, and difficult. This process involves the storage and sharing of personal data that requires security and privacy. To address these issues, we have proposed a blockchain, AI, and IoT-based framework for COVID-19 contact tracing and distancing. In this framework, Every user registers on the blockchain and gets public and private key pairs, the access level of every user is defined in the smart contract. The activity data of the user is collected using the smartwatch, which ensures real-time and accurate data collection. The data is encrypted with the keys of the data owner and stored on the cloud. So in case of data leakage, no one can decrypt the data without keys, so in this way, the secure data storage issue is resolved. Every transaction is recorded on the blockchain, it makes auditing easy in case of any malicious data transaction. Every user can access data according to its access level defined in the smart contract, it ensures the security of data. By the analysis of data, the ML model predicts the infected person and spot the COVID-19 hotspot areas.","","978-1-6654-2343-4","10.1109/ICRAI54018.2021.9651350","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9651350","Blockchain;Artificial Intelligence;IoT;COVID-19;Contact Tracing","COVID-19;Smart contracts;Human factors;Predictive models;Social factors;Real-time systems;Blockchains","blockchains;data privacy;Internet of Things;private key cryptography;public key cryptography","COVID-19 contact tracing;social distance;infected person;personal data;blockchain;IoT-based framework;activity data;accurate data collection;data owner;data leakage;secure data storage issue;malicious data transaction;COVID-19 hotspot areas;public key pairs;private key pairs","","1","","26","IEEE","28 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The malicious service provider enables to (i) track the precise mobility patterns of citizens. (ii) collect the data to infer privacy-sensitive information, e.g., where the parking requester (i.e., driver) socialize, work, and live; (iii) analyze trajectories to monitor the location of the driver for entertainment (e.g., discovering one-night stands). To design a decentralized smart and practical parking platform without compromising the privacy of the entities is an urgent issue for the smart city. Blockchain (or distributed public ledger technology) is a near-ideal decentralized and distributed solution for centralized parking-space-recommendation systems.

Moreover, utilizing the advantages of blockchain, distributed personal data markets have recently been considered because all participants behave selfishly for their profits in the markets. Since the participants may behave maliciously, it is necessary to prevent such behavior, and one of the considered approaches is putting additional deposits as a penalty into blockchain smart contracts. Since data brokers give various advantages to maintain personal data trading markets, many studies have considered both data brokers and blockchain at the same time. However, those studies have mainly focused on putting deposits into data buyers/sellers but not data brokers. However, since data brokers are also major players in the market, it is necessary to consider deposit decision models for data brokers. Hence, this paper proposes a deposit decision model for data brokers in distributed personal data markets using blockchain. Particularly, this paper proposes a profit model with deposits depending on their behavior for handling contracts and a credit level model that puts fewer deposits for a data broker with a higher credit level to motivate the data brokers’ truthful behavior. With the analysis of the proposed models, this paper shows that the models are feasible to motivate data brokers’ truthful behavior by allocating deposits for not only a large enough penalty but also a fair enough incentive.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3104870","Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP) Grant through Korean Government [Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT)] (Development of 5G-IoT Trustworthy AI-Data Commons Framework, 50%)(grant numbers:2020-0-00048); Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI) Grant through Korean Government (Core Technology Research on Trust Data Connectome, 50%)(grant numbers:21ZR1330); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9514497","Personal data market;data broker;blockchain;deposit","Data models;Blockchains;Biological system modeling;Analytical models;Solid modeling;Smart contracts;Pricing","","","","2","","30","CCBY","16 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper seeks to facilitate and protect the voting process by making an online voting system for elections and referendums connected with voting devices. The IoT and Blockchain have been used with this system to ensure that users' data are protected from theft and prevent eavesdropping or vote tampering to guarantee the integrity of the voting. The blockchain encrypts votes in order to protect every vote from forgery. This system is not directed to governments only, but to all governmental and private agencies. For example, governments can establish referendums or elections, and anyone who has reached the legal age and has a voting card issued by the government will be able to vote, thus we get rid of the traditional methods and dispense with ballot boxes, standing in long queues and delay counting the votes that cost governments a lot of time, effort and money. Also, any institution or private corporation that wishes to conduct polls and questionnaires or to conduct a specific study in order to collect opinions from people of society can simply use this system to reach them. The system assists the concerned authorities in obtaining results quickly without delay, taking into account the differences in voting process between government and private organizations.","","978-1-6654-2862-0","10.1109/ICTSA52017.2021.9406528","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9406528","Voting;Internet of Things (IoT);Blockchain;Ethereum;smart contract;One Day Password (ODP).","Electronic voting systems;Law;Blockchain;Fingerprint recognition;Tools;Forgery;Delays","blockchains;cryptography;data privacy;government data processing","online voting system;voting devices;Ethereum blockchain;government;voting card;IoT;democratic practice;encryption","","5","","14","IEEE","20 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, a variety of technical challenges, e.g., security issues, incentive mechanism design, are still awaiting further research efforts. In this respect, blockchain proves to be an elegant solution for federated learning to overcome these issues, and thus has been applied in federated learning in many scenarios with success. In this paper, we presented a comprehensive survey for blockchain-enabled federated learning, proposed its technical framework and discussed the key research issues. This work represents the first attempt for reviewing the literature aiming at integrating blockchain and federated learning, and can be expected to offer useful guidance for establishing a new infrastructure for decentralized and secured data circulation, as well as promoting the development of related industries.","","978-1-6654-3337-2","10.1109/DTPI52967.2021.9540163","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018AAA0101401); Science and Technology Development Fund(grant numbers:0050/2020/A1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9540163","blockchain;federated learning;smart contract","Industries;Data privacy;Digital twin;Conferences;Machine learning;Collaborative work;Rendering (computer graphics)","Big Data;blockchains;data protection;learning (artificial intelligence)","distributed machine learning;blockchain-enabled federated learning;data circulation;data sharing;privacy protection;Big Data","","4","","7","IEEE","22 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Shippers are issued invoices from suppliers and carriers. Shippers carry out goods receiving and invoice processing before payment processing of bills for suppliers and carriers, where invoice processing includes tasks like processing claims and adjusting the bill payments. Goods receiving involves verification of received goods by the Shipper’s receiving team. Invoice processing is carried out by the Shipper’s accounts payable team, which in turn is verified by the accounts receivable teams of suppliers and carriers. This paper presents a blockchain-based accounts payable system that generates claims for the deficiency in the goods received and accordingly adjusts the payment in the bills for suppliers and carriers. Primary motivations for these supply chain organizations to adopt blockchain-based accounts payable systems are to eliminate the process redundancies (accounts payable vs. accounts receivable), to reduce the number of disputes among the transacting participants, and to accelerate the accounts payable processes via optimizations in the claims generation and blockchain-based dispute reconciliation.","","978-1-6654-3578-9","10.1109/ICBC51069.2021.9461053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9461053","Goods trade;accounts payable;invoice processing;dispute management;blockchain;smart contract","Conferences;Supply chains;Redundancy;Transportation;Blockchain;Organizations;Cryptocurrency","blockchains;financial data processing;goods distribution;invoicing;optimisation;supply chain management","payment processing;invoice processing;blockchain based accounts payable platform;goods trade;supply chain transaction;goods transportation;shippers buying goods;bill payments;shipper receiving team;shipper accounts payable team;primary motivations;supply chain organizations;transacting participants;optimization;optimization;claims generation","","2","","20","IEEE","24 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent improvements in software, hardware, and communication system to create different applications and standards make these technologies conceivable. Today, new technologies are attached to vehicles that recognize and enhance the driving experience of possible drive concerns. The integration of vehicles involves three main components: sensors, information systems, and communication systems to develop a connected vehicle network. Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication is employed within a connected network to ease traffic congestion and enhance passenger protection. There exist many issues like security of vehicles, communication interfaces and stored data. Therefore, a Blockchain-enabled Secure Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication System (BSVCS) has been proposed to provide security to the communication interfaces for connected vehicles. Vehicles can communicate directly (for short-range) or via a cellular connection (for long-range) using C-V2X technology. It can also contribute to authoritative management to store the key securely and the process of its generation. A 2-step authentication process (2-SAP) has been introduced to identify a genuine user and to detect any unauthorized user. The proposed system can resolve the security issues such as no-authentication, broadcasting, the securities arbitration rule, and cybersecurity in the V2V communication system. It also secures vehicle security and user privacy in the V2V communication system.","","978-1-6654-3796-7","10.1109/ICSPIS53734.2021.9652424","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9652424","V2V communication;C-V2X technology;blockchain Technology;smart contracts;vehicle security","Connected vehicles;Communication systems;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Software;Sensor systems;Sensors;Security","automobiles;data privacy;intelligent transportation systems;message authentication;mobile computing;mobile radio;road safety;road traffic;security of data;traffic engineering computing;vehicular ad hoc networks","security issues;securities arbitration rule;V2V communication system;vehicle security;vehicular communications;intelligent transport systems;self-contained motor vehicles;information systems;communication systems;connected vehicle network;communication interfaces;blockchain enabled secure vehicle-to-vehicle communication system","","2","","10","IEEE","27 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With this industry catering to such a large section of the population, each diagnosed case may have varying levels of severity. A robust and fluid system of care naturally causes significant privacy concerns involving patient information. We propose a working model for secure storage of historical medical records of a patient and protected sharing between doctors and hospitals. A medical file is encrypted using a random symmetric key and is stored in a decentralized peer-peer storage system. The random symmetric key is encrypted using the patient's public key and is securely stored in a public blockchain. The patient's private key, along with the hospital's public key, is input into a proxy key generation cryptosystem that uses a Yao's Multiparty Computation Circuit, to produce a re-encryption key. This key can be used to re-encrypt the random symmetric key stored in the Blockchain to give a ciphertext that can further be deciphered using the hospital's private key. Thus, with the decoded random symmetric key in hand, the medical record is retrieved from storage and decrypted for access. The medical record is then forwarded to a specialized doctor for specific treatment. This system is secure and provides the doctor with the patient's medical records on demand with a fast and immutable technique.","2157-4960","978-1-6654-4399-9","10.1109/NTMS49979.2021.9432643","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9432643","Healthcare;Medical Records;Distributed Storage;Proxy Re-encryption;Multi-party Computation;Smart Contracts","Industries;Privacy;Hospitals;Economic indicators;Sociology;Blockchain;Public key cryptography","blockchains;cryptography;data privacy;health care;medical information systems;peer-to-peer computing","secure distributed medical record storage;healthcare industry;patient information;historical medical records;medical file;decentralized peer-peer storage system;public blockchain;hospital;proxy key generation cryptosystem;re-encryption key;decoded random symmetric key;Yao multiparty computation circuit;efficiency 10.0 percent","","2","","21","IEEE","18 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But most of these services are centralized and hosted by a third party which gives them the authority to monitor features like fare calculation, user data, etc. Privacy and trust are major concerns in such a system. The purpose of our paper is to make a decentralized application for ride-sharing where all transactions, fare calculation, matching and information is stored on a Distributed Ledger. The ledger will be accessible to all the peers in the network. This will match users with rides in a decentralized way without relying on third parties of any centralized network which makes the system transparent and reliable.

First of all, the high existence rate of malicious nodes in the chain made it difficult to well purify the network environment, meanwhile the malicious nodes cannot be easily dealt with. Secondly, the correlation between nodes can still be discovered through analysis. As a result, the privacy of users' information cannot be well protected. This paper proposes a distributed identity authentication scheme based on Zero-knowledge proof, which uses face recognition technology to ensure the uniqueness and legitimacy of identity and control the generating of malicious nodes; Zero-knowledge proof algorithm is used to encrypt and support face data to prevent user identity information from being disclosed.

For e-voting methods, blockchain presents new possibilities to properly meet transparency, integrity, anonymity and many other security properties. As the need for blockchains keeps rising, demand for bigger, more scalable, more adaptable, and more cost-effective multipurpose chain is also high. Conventional blockchains are incapable of meeting all of these demands. To solve the problems (mostly performance) associated with main blockchains, sidechain technology has recently evolved as a separate chain connected to the main chain that runs in parallel with transactions. Our proposed method is designed to operate on a public blockchain, but we separate the storage of voting information of each candidate using a sidechain to offer a cost-effective blockchain-based voting mechanism by ensuring the security properties such as anonymity, integrity, privacy, security, fairness, receipt freeness and so many. In future, we will broadly discuss and implement this voting system.","","978-623-6264-20-1","10.23919/EECSI53397.2021.9624282","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9624282","Voting;Blockchain;Ethereum;Decentralization;Smart Contracts;Sidechain","Electrical engineering;Computer science;Privacy;Electronic voting systems;Law;Blockchains;Security","blockchains;data privacy;government data processing;Internet;public domain software","BSEVOTING;democratic society;citizen;significant legal rights;e-voting methods;security properties;cost-effective multipurpose chain;conventional blockchains;main blockchains;sidechain technology;separate chain;public blockchain;electronic voting system;cost-effective blockchain-based voting mechanism","","","","27","","6 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite this huge investment in digitizing the supply chain system, complete visibility of a product at any given time is not fully achieved. Protecting authentic information throughout the supply chain management becomes a challenging task along with maintaining the quality of products. As all parties of a supply chain system have their standalone software, real-time communication amongst this software developed in different platforms using different technologies is not quite feasible. Other illegal parties can inject counterfeit products into the supply chain by taking advantage of this situation. This can pose a significant threat not only to the company’s revenue but also to its public image as well.

The overall structure of the system and the design of each module function are also introduced to provide new ideas for the study of a secure decentralized communication model.","","978-1-6654-0549-2","10.1109/HotICN53262.2021.9680848","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9680848","Instant Messaging (IM);Blockchain;Smart Contract;Decentralized Identity (DID);IPFS","Data privacy;Information-centric networking;Instant messaging;Data models;Real-time systems;Blockchains;Encryption","blockchains;computer network security;cryptography;data privacy;electronic messaging;Internet;telecommunication computing","IPFS technology;blockchain technology;data encryption;decentralized instant messaging model;user identity;real-time communication;communication data leakage;data privacy;trusted IM model;blockchain-based trusted instant messaging model;decentralized communication model security;distributed identity;DID;Internet","","","","17","IEEE","24 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to control this pandemic, screening tests such as PCR have become essential. For example, in the case of a trip, the traveler must carry out a PCR test within 72 hours before his departure and if he is not a carrier of the COVID-19, he can therefore travel by presenting, during check-in and boarding, the negative result sheet to the agent. The latter will then verify the presented sheet by trusting: (a) the medical biology laboratory, (b) the credibility of the traveler for not having changed the PCR result from “positive to negative”. Therefore, this confidence and this verification are made without being based on any mechanism of security and integrity, despite the great importance of the PCR test results to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, we propose in this paper a blockchain-based decentralized trust architecture that aims to guarantee the integrity, immutability and traceability of COVID-19 test results.

However, the online transactions security and privacy protection of EVs poses challenges with respect to confidentiality and integrity preservation. To cope up with the issues, we design a consortium blockchain-based scheme to ensure secure energy transactions between EVs and the SPs without trusted third-party intervention. Moreover, the energy pricing and the amount of traded energy problems for demand response are solved by a double auction mechanism to maximize the social welfare. Numerical results based on a real-time implementation on a private Ethereum network having smart contract demonstrated that the auction-based mechanism achieves social welfare maximization with privacy protection of online transactions between EVs and the SPs. The results obtained show that the rate of convergence, scalability metric average latency, and standard deviation of the energy transactions have been improved by approximately 18.18%, 15%, and 28.1%, respectively in comparison to the existing schemes.

The current approach for IoT data trading relies on a centralized third-party entity to negotiate between data consumers and data providers, which is inefficient and insecure on a large scale. In comparison, a decentralized approach based on distributed ledger technologies (DLT) enables data trading while ensuring trust, security, and privacy. However, due to the lack of understanding of the communication efficiency between sellers and buyers, there is still a significant gap in benchmarking the data trading protocols in IoT environments. Motivated by this knowledge gap, we introduce a model for DLT-based IoT data trading over the narrowband Internet-of-Things (NB-IoT) system, intended to support massive environmental sensing. We characterize the communication efficiency of three basic DLT-based IoT data trading protocols via NB-IoT connectivity in terms of latency and energy consumption.

A decentralized selective ring-based access control mechanism is introduced along with device authentication and patient records anonymity algorithms to improve the proposed system's security capabilities.

ERMTS/ECTS, CBTC, PTC and other train control systems based on radio communication are being deployed in different countries. These systems meet the high safety requirements for passenger traffic, and cover from congested urban areas to high-speed trains. However, there is a set of facilities, such as ports, dry ports, facilities for the repair and maintenance of trains, logistic centers, mines, etc., whose trains, that only carry freight, circulate in a controlled environment at a low speed. These facilities have low safety requirements. For them, present commercial systems become too expensive, so that, in most cases, railway traffic is still handled manually. This paper presents a system to aid in the exploitation of rail traffic for this type of facilities, called SFPS (Seville Ferro-Port System). SFPS presents many of the features of the most advanced traffic control systems, but incorporates innovations based on Information and Communications Technologies to reduce costs. To this end, train location is based on a satellite global positioning system, physical signs are replaced by virtual ones, displayed in an On-Board Unit, and communication is almost entirely wireless.

The authentication mechanism in the model employs a smart contract for authentication and access control, public key cryptography for providing accounts and ensuring accounts' security, and a distributed ledger for security audit. In addition, to speed up out-sourced computations and reduce electricity consumption, an ABE model with parallel outsourced computation (ABEM-POC) is constructed, and a generic parallel computation method for ABE is proposed.

Therefore, a distributed and decentralized computing architecture is imperative, where edge-centric computing, such as fog computing and mist computing, has been recently proposed. Edge-centric computing resources can be managed locally and personally rather than being administered by a remote centralized third party. However, security and privacy issues are the main challenges due to the absence of trust between the IoT devices and edge computing nodes (ECNs). A blockchain, as a decentralized, trustless, and immutable public ledger, can well solve the trust-absence issue. In this article, we first elaborate on the security and privacy issues of edge-computing-enabled IoT, and then present the key characteristics of blockchains, which make blockchains well suited for the edge-centric IoT scenarios. Furthermore, we propose a general framework for blockchain-based edge-computing-enabled IoT scenarios that specifies the step-by-step procedure of a single transaction between an IoT end and an ECN. In addition, we design a smart contract within a private blockchain network that exploits the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm, asynchronous advantage actor–critic (A3C), to allocate the edge computing resources, which exemplifies how artificial intelligence (AI) can be combined with blockchains. We further discuss the benefits of the convergence of AI and blockchains.

Therefore, the critical part of CBDC is the network architecture that saves computing resources, the technical scheme that is in line with economic ecology, and efficient consensus algorithms. In this paper, we propose a hybrid blockchain system with a modularity network for CBDC. The account scheme is used to record frequently circulated digital currencies, especially for massive small payment transactions when the digital assets and smart contracts with large value fluctuations and weak liquidity are recorded using the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) scheme. In terms of network architecture, a modular blockchain architecture is proposed, and a sliced data storage solution is designed to enhance the concurrency of this structured network. We also proposed a CBDC supervision mode for blockchain, and on this basis, the DPOS-BFT algorithm is optimized, which reduces the two rounds of consensus of the original algorithm to one round.

Lightning network and Spider network are alternates that build bidirectional payment channels on top of cryptocurrency networks using smart contracts, to enable fast transactions that bypass the Blockchain. In this article, we study the problem of routing transactions in such a payment processing network. We first propose a Stochastic model to study such a system, as opposed to a fluid model that is studied in the literature. Each link in such a model is a two-sided queue, and unlike classical queues, such queues are not stable unless there is an external control. We propose a notion of stability for the payment processing network consisting of such two-sided queues using the notion of on-chain rebalancing. We then characterize the capacity region and propose a throughput optimal algorithm that stabilizes the system under any load within the capacity region. The stochastic model enables us to study closed-loop policies, which typically have better queuing/delay performance than the open-loop policies (or static split rules) studied in the literature. We investigate this through simulations.","2325-5870","","10.1109/TCNS.2021.3088799","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9454385","Algorithm design and analysis;communication networks;stochastic processes","Blockchain;Routing;Bitcoin;Communication networks;Stochastic processes;Smart contracts;Algorithm design and analysis","blockchains;closed loop systems;cryptocurrencies;financial data processing;optimisation;queueing theory;stochastic processes;telecommunication network routing;transaction processing","two-sided queue;throughput optimal algorithm;stochastic model;throughput optimal routing;cryptocurrency networks;distributed alternative;lightning network;Spider network;bidirectional payment channels;fast transactions;routing transactions;payment processing network;fluid model;classical queues;centralized financial transaction networks;blockchain-based payment systems;on-chain rebalancing;capacity region;closed-loop policies;queuing-delay performance;open-loop policies","","9","","39","IEEE","14 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By combining the MA-CPABE and proxy re-encryption, the rights owner can flexibly sell the copyright to different users with once encryption by an agent who cannot access any information related to digital content when changing the ciphertext access policy as required. By using the smart contract of Ethereum, a fair trade of the decryption keys between the rights owner and rights requester is implemented. In order to further improve fairness, another blockchain is used as a ledge to store information related to digital rights, which greatly reduces the storage overhead in public blockchain. Security analysis shows that our scheme can provide IND-CPA security, resist collusion attacks, and protect the user’s privacy.

Hence, the security of IoV systems remains an inevitable concern for researchers and automotive manufacturers. In this paper, we provide a Blockchain-based solution for reputation management in cloud-based IoV system. It ensures the monitoring of vehicles in the network through the computation of routing-based metrics by watchdog nodes, and the continuous update of their reputations, while calling for the use of blockchain technology.

HIE improves healthcare quality and streamlines healthcare administrative work. These advantages have propelled health- care stakeholders to implement HIE. However, challenged by issues such as security, privacy, and costs, HIE is not widespread. Recent studies have suggested blockchain-based HIE for solving security and privacy issues. Unfortunately, existing blockchain-based HIE studies do not consider the privacy issues caused by analyzing senders and receivers of transactions in the blockchain. In this work, we suggest MEXchange, a novel blockchain-based privacy-preserving HIE that prevents the privacy issue by obscuring the sender and concealing receiver addresses. We propose smart contracts and workflow that use ring signature and stealth address for blockchain-based HIE. Software components and implementation of MEXchange on the Ethereum private network are discussed. We evaluate MEXchange quantitatively by measuring the transaction latency and throughput of exchanging. Also, we evaluate MEXchange qualitatively using the requirements of the Office of National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC). Moreover, we proceed with threat modeling based on STRIDE. Finally, we compare MEXchange with Ancile, FHIRChain, Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise Cross-Enterprise Document Sharing (IHE XDS), and MedRec.

This technology has the ability to run smart contracts as well as register users. There are several consensus algorithms used in blockchains. Many researchers are looking into the consensus algorithm in order to ensure the security and authenticity of transaction information in blockchains. In determining which consensus algorithm research areas should be examined, several existing papers from other researchers have been analyzed. This study is motivated by the need to determine the best consensus key. Thus, this study will examine the comparison of the two consensus algorithms which are Proof of Stake (PoS) and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) algorithms. A further focus of this research study is on the parameters that are being used by these two algorithms. Analyses are done based on the number of miners and the number of created blocks to determine how long is necessary to produce a new block. The measurements were conducted through the simulation tool, which is Ethereum in a private network. The impact of parameters was assessed and analyzed based on the results. In addition, we conclude by determining their scalability as well as their efficiency. As the results show, DPoS is much better than PoS when it comes to producing a new block, with a percentage difference of 68%-73% between them. For future work, the algorithm studied can be extended to the Dual Delegated Proof of Stake (DDPoS) and the relationship and comparison between Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) and Dual Delegated Proof of Stake (DDPoS) can be discussed. Furthermore, the key parameters of the analysis can be extended as well such as the power of the consumptions.","","978-1-6654-4303-6","10.1109/ICoDSA53588.2021.9617549","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9617549","blockchain;consensus;PoS;DPoS","Scalability;Software algorithms;Smart contracts;Consensus algorithm;Tools;Time measurement;Blockchains","authorisation;blockchains","blockchain consensus algorithm;Stake algorithms;dual delegated proof;proof of stake algorithm;delegated proof of stake algorithm;PoS algorithm;DPoS algorithm;Ethereum;public ledger","","4","","18","IEEE","3 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, we propose data producing, data storing, and data sharing schemas. In the data producing schema, we deploy a group signature scheme for a group of reputable organizations that provide the same type of service, an organization in the group generates a valuable digital data from raw data sent from a data owner and then issues a certificate on the ciphertext of this digital data. In the data storing schema, the data owner uploads his/her data to the public Inter-Planetary File System network and then stores the access address of the stored data and the corresponding certificate on the blockchain ledger. In the data sharing schema, everyone on the system could verify the reliability of shared data before sending a data sharing request to the data owner.

However, the problem with the SIP protocol is that it was not designed to be secure by nature as the HTTP digest authentication used in SIP is insecure, making it vulnerable to a variety of attacks. The current solutions rely on several standardised encryption protocols, such as TLS and IPsec, to protect SIP registration messages. However, the current centralised solutions do not scale well and cause algorithm overload when encoding and decoding SIP messages. In trying to rectify this issue, we propose in this paper a blockchain-based lightweight authentication mechanism, which involves a decentralised identity model to authenticate the SIP client to the SIP server. Our mechanism uses a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain to ensure trust, accountability and preserves user privacy. We provided a proof-of-concept implementation to demonstrate our work. Further analysis of this approach's usability, mainly CPU and memory usage, was conducted comparing to IPsec and TLS. Then we discussed our system's security and presented a security analysis. Our analysis proves that our approach satisfies the SIP protocol security requirements.","2768-0029","978-1-6654-0722-9","10.1109/CSNet52717.2021.9614646","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9614646","Voice over IP (VoIP);SIP protocol;Blockchain technology","Privacy;Smart contracts;Authentication;Encoding;Blockchains;Encryption;Security","blockchains;cryptographic protocols;cryptography;data privacy;Internet telephony;IP networks;message authentication;protocols;signalling protocols","blockchain-based authentication;sip-based voip systems;Session Initiation Protocol;principal signalling protocol;IP systems;standardised encryption protocols;SIP registration messages;current centralised solutions;blockchain-based lightweight authentication mechanism;decentralised identity model;SIP client;SIP server;Ethereum blockchain;accountability;security analysis;user privacy;protocol security requirements","","3","","25","IEEE","23 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, we build up a trust evaluation blockchain, where the trustworthiness of an involved vehicle is evaluated by distributed road-side units (RSUs) based on the rating feedback from neighboring vehicles. To enable efficient and privacy-preserving trust evaluation, we deploy the feedback messages aggregation and trust evaluation on two smart contracts, which are executed and verified by distributed RSUs automatically. In particular, identity authentication based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) cryptosystem is introduced to prevent privacy leakage of vehicles.

In the case of Covid-19, the high reproductive number of the virus necessitates that all contacts of an infected individual be found within the shortest possible time to slow the rate of spreading. This presents multiple challenges because of the highly invasive nature of tracing activities which demand the mobility history of patients. Patients may be unwilling to cooperate or may be unable to communicate if the infection has advanced to the point where critical care is necessary. To speedily locate contacts of an infected individual, we propose using communications data logs from telecommunications operators. We employ a modified directed graph to determine which other individuals have been in close proximity to an infected individual in a specific frame of time. We then generate a contact graph and place it in a secure offline storage platform. We employ Smart Contracts to control access to the data while the blockchain keeps records of the provenance of all data and transactions.

Motivated by this, we propose a novel digital twin based fair trading platform built upon consortium blockchain to enable city-wide vehicular resource sharing. Specifically, we first develop a digital twin based vehicular platform to enable vehicular resource sharing in the cloud.

Moreover, various encryption methods such as homomorphic encryption focus on protecting the data stored on the blockchain, but few enhance client-side data security. Motivated by this condition, we develop an image-based privacy-preserving scheme to store users' financial service data as images.

However, even though most cloud service providers already employ deduplication techniques, they consume a lot of overhead bandwidth. Hence, we came up with a solution to reduce this overhead bandwidth by creating a middleware deduplication layer that checks the originality of a file without the need to communicate with the cloud. This results in reducing a substantial amount of internet overhead and at the same time making the deduplication process much quicker since it is closer to the edge device. We implement the deduplication layer using a decentralized blockchain structure due to its inherent security and scalability features.To protect the confidentiality of sensitive data while supporting deduplication, the convergent encryption techniques such as double hashing has been proposed to ensure that the user account credentials are secure and not misused. We implement our blockchain layer using Ganache that provides us with an Ethereum powered blockchain to test and deploy our prototype. Hence all the file transactions i.e., uploading, sharing and deletion of files will go through ganache and get added to our local blockchain network. We define Smart contracts to communicate with the ganache layer which mines a block every time a new file is uploaded or shared with another user and file metadata is stored in each of these blocks. Since every unique file will have its own block, the file metadata will help in achieving deduplication at this layer.","","978-1-6654-0430-3","10.1109/ICCICT50803.2021.9510039","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9510039","client side data deduplication;blockchain;Ethereum","Cloud computing;Scalability;Smart contracts;Prototypes;Bandwidth;Metadata;Blockchains","cloud computing;cryptography;data compression;Internet;meta data;middleware;storage management","deduplication framework;edge-level blockchain;data deduplication;important data compression technique;cloud storage;storage space;cloud service providers;deduplication techniques;overhead bandwidth;middleware deduplication layer;internet overhead;deduplication process;edge device;decentralized blockchain structure;inherent security;scalability features;sensitive data;convergent encryption techniques;user account credentials;blockchain layer;file transactions i.e;local blockchain network;ganache layer;file metadata;unique file","","","","23","IEEE","12 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Computer worms are used to conduct cyberattacks to compromise computers and the data stored on them. The self-propagation characteristic of computer worms allows them to spread fast and infect many hosts in a computer network. Thus, this makes it difficult for humans to deploy a timely countermeasure to confront worm infections within the attacked network. Worm containment is utilized to stop worm spread in a computer network. The containment technique should be automatic, timely, reliable, and implemented in a distributed manner. In this paper, we introduce Rearguard, a novel blockchain-based automatic worm containment system. Rearguard achieves worm containment by creating and distributing vulnerability-based filters for the vulnerabilities being exploited. A vulnerability-based filter is employed to drop any received network message contains variants of a worm that attempts to exploit the same vulnerability. The vulnerability-based filter generation is carried out utilizing a blockchain smart contract deployed in the attacked network. The blockchain ensures reliability, timely response, trustworthy filters, and the availability of all filters in a distributed ledger that is maintained by network hosts. Rearguard has been implemented against a synthetic worm. The obtained results show that Rearguard introduces low overhead as well as ensures timely and automatic response to worm attacks.","","978-1-6654-4574-0","10.1109/ITC-Egypt52936.2021.9513932","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9513932","","Computer worms;Distributed ledger;Computer network reliability;Smart contracts;Computer networks;Blockchains;Telecommunications","blockchains;computer network security;invasive software","Rearguard;information technology systems;computer worms;computer network;worm infections;worm spread;vulnerability-based filter generation;worm attacks;blockchain-based automatic worm containment system","","","","21","IEEE","20 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The blockchain is a closed system that is transparent to the outside world. No external logic can operate on chain data. The only node or interface that can add data to the blockchain is Oracles Machines. The oracle is a special node generated through a consensus mechanism. It is responsible for the ordering of on-chain requests, the simulation of the on-chain process, and the delivery of data for smart contracts. For example, the Chain Link node of Ethereum and the Orders node of Hyperledger. Although the blockchain is a decentralized structure, it is often a centralized and independent component outside the blockchain for the oracle. Its reliability, performance, and security are not protected by the blockchain system . How to protect the safety, reliability and efficiency of the oracle is a technical bottleneck of the blockchain. In response to the above-mentioned challenges, this paper studies the dynamic evolution configuration of the oracle in the case of a blockchain failure and the application software evolution algorithm based on the fault-tolerant oracle. The reflector technology is used in the research to monitor the dynamic changes of the oracle in real time. When a fault occurs, it immediately perceives the changes in the structure of the fault-tolerant blockchain to drive the evolution of the application software system and ensure the safe operation of the application system. Configure the fault-tolerant oracle Orderer environment based on the open source Fabric blockchain platform, and on this basis, experimentally verify the effectiveness of the application software evolution algorithm. Finally, a block chain application software system designed and implemented based on the above research results is introduced to further verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm from the perspective of practical application.","2693-2776","978-1-7281-8535-4","10.1109/IMCEC51613.2021.9482348","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9482348","Fabric blockchain;orderer Oracle;software evolution algorithm","Fault tolerance;Automation;Heuristic algorithms;Software algorithms;Fault tolerant systems;Smart contracts;Blockchain","blockchains;fault tolerant computing;multi-agent systems;public domain software;real-time systems;software development management;software maintenance","fault-tolerant oracle Orderer environment;open source Fabric blockchain platform;block chain application software system;point-to-point transmission;consensus mechanism;Oracles Machines;blockchain failure;fault tolerant blockchain;software evolution algorithm;distributed data storage;encryption algorithm;reflector technology;real time monitoring","","","","21","IEEE","19 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However with the advent of edge computing, it falls short of many desirable properties. These include accurate fine-grained geographic localization of edge services, fast look-ups, and ensuring record freshness and cache integrity for end users. To satisfy these properties we consider blockchain-based solutions, a counter-intuitive approach as blockchain is not often associated with performance or the latency requirements of the edge. Despite this, we argue blockchain can address the shortcomings we've identified in DNS specifically in the edge context. We've found blockchain-based solutions are not sufficient as is, thus we present GeoENS - a prototype based on the Ethereum blockchain suitable for, and enabled by, the edge. It achieves these goals via novel record organization for smart contract, push-based record invalidation, and a look through cache. Given the skepticism of blockchain to out-perform DNS, we provide preliminary results which show GeoENS achieves its goals of fine-grained geo-localization accurate to ±20 meters, fast query latency for non-cached records under 50 ms, and cache freshness at edge scale of 10 minutes (vs. 3 hour DNS TTLs.) GeoENS does this with negligible bandwidth and CPU load overhead and reasonable storage requirements in the proposed deployment scenario.","","978-1-4503-8390-5","10.1145/3453142.3491288","SRC; DARPA; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9709062","edge;DNS;blockchain;Ethereum;ENS","Meters;Location awareness;Web and internet services;Standards organizations;Smart contracts;Prototypes;Organizations","blockchains;computer network security;IP networks","blockchain-based edge DNS;Domain Name System;IP addresses;Internet services;Internet ecosystem;edge computing;fine-grained geographic localization;edge services;fast look-ups;record freshness;blockchain-based solutions;counter-intuitive approach;edge context;GeoENS;Ethereum blockchain;push-based record invalidation;fine-grained geo-localization;noncached records;cache freshness;edge scale;DNS TTLs;record organization;time 50.0 ms;time 10.0 min;time 3.0 hour","","","","47","","16 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Totem is an entity used in TOTEM architecture for putting constraints on computational operations. Authorised users in the network are allowed to write their own code in a specific format through a TOTEM defined SDK for analysing the data provided by the data owner. The SDK, along with the deployed smart contracts in the network, form a pre monitoring system that keeps track of totem entity value associated with each users’ submitted codes using an estimator table.

Consequently, it has forced the countries to follow immediate strategies to alleviate this crisis's impacts. The lockdown and social distance were the most applied precautionary procedures. This situation has devastating consequences for both economic and social life. The construction sector is affected by this temporary paralysis, especially the public-private partnerships (PPP) infrastructure projects with a long-term contract and different stakeholders. Some earlier researches have analyzed the consequences and suggested options to alleviate the negative impacts, but potential positive risks are still spotting. Therefore, there is a need to follow proactive behavior to maximize the potentiality of opportunities. This research is exploring the positive risks for PPP infrastructure projects during COVID 19. This objective has been attained by a literature survey for allocated risks for PPP projects, factors affecting successful PPP projects, and the current practices as a response strategy to COVID -19. The research findings will contribute to building a known base of resilience plans for pandemic through two scenarios of negative and positive impacts to support PPP projects with leading practices. The revealed opportunities have been revealed based on exploring the common concepts between four main areas: 1) Positive Impacts of COVID-19, 2) Principles of resilient infrastructure, 3) Critical success factors of PPP projects, and 4) Current practices to respond to COVID-19. It was found that besides the tremendous burden on project stakeholders, users, the private corporate sector, and the public sector for the short and long term, some opportunities could be attained for PPP infrastructure projects. These revealed opportunities have been summarized as follows: 1) The need for implementing the resilience strategy and long term thinking, 2) Available time for maintenance work and updating operating systems for completed projects, 3) Priority to support and invest in innovative smart infrastructure projects that adopt artificial intelligence and smart systems that reduce human resource interferences and control the social distance, and 4) exploring the need to simplify or remedy the procurement processes of PPP. The concluded opportunities will help investors and public partners react positively during the pandemic and reduce the negative impacts and maximize positive impacts. This attitude will help PPP projects to survive in order to complete successfully after the crisis and integrate resilience into infrastructure projects.","","978-1-6654-1927-7","10.1109/SusTech51236.2021.9467426","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9467426","Public-Private Partnership;COVID 19;Infrastructure;Resilience strategy","COVID-19;Procurement;Pandemics;Process control;Human factors;Social factors;Paralysis","construction industry;contracts;investment;organisational aspects;procurement;project management;public administration;risk management","innovative smart infrastructure projects;completed projects;project stakeholders;resilient infrastructure;revealed opportunities;successful PPP projects;COVID 19;PPP infrastructure projects;potential positive risks;public-private partnerships infrastructure projects;social distance;pandemic;resilience strategy;COVID-19;infrastructure PPP projects","","","","23","IEEE","1 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These essential places have proven to be hotspots for the dissemination of the coronavirus. One of the most efficient ways to curb the spread is to maintain social distancing. Currently, due to the lack of strict supervision, social distancing is not being followed. The paper provides a solution to implement a smart device meant to detect social distancing violations in public areas. The paper also compares three detection approaches, namely the You Only Look Once (YOLO) approach and its variants, the Histogram of Oriented Gradients – Support Vector Machine (HOG-SVM) approach, and the top view camera angle approach to detect these violations. The most practical approach, i.e., the YOLOv3-tiny, was loaded onto the Raspberry Pi to make a fully automated device. The paper also addresses the design flow, the working of the different approaches, and the future scope in advancements.","","978-1-6654-2867-5","10.1109/ICESC51422.2021.9532822","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9532822","Social Distancing;Human Detection;You Only Look Once Model;Histogram of Oriented Gradients;Support Vector Machine;Contour Detection;Raspberry Pi","COVID-19;Support vector machines;Histograms;Pandemics;Communication systems;Human factors;Cameras","computer vision;diseases;epidemics;feature extraction;health care;medical computing;microcomputers;microorganisms;object detection;support vector machines","smart device;social distancing violations;COVID-19 pandemic;support vector machine;top view camera angle approach;histogram of oriented gradients;You Only Look Once;YOLO;Raspberry Pi;design flow","","","","17","IEEE","23 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this article, an energy sharing mechanism is proposed to accommodate prosumers' strategic decision-making on their self-production and demand in the presence of capacity constraints. Under this setting, prosumers play a generalized Nash game. We prove main properties of the game: an equilibrium exists and is partially unique; no prosumer is worse off by energy sharing and the price-of-anarchy is 1-O(1/I) where I is the number of prosumers. In particular, the PoA tends to 1 with a growing number of prosumers, meaning that the resulting total cost under the proposed energy sharing approaches social optimum. We prove that the corresponding prosumers' strategies converge to the social optimal solution as well. Finally we propose a bidding process and prove that it converges to the energy sharing equilibrium under mild conditions.

To remedy that, leading methods such as ranging and cooperation have improved the positioning accuracy to varying degrees, but they are still full of challenges in practical applications. Especially for cooperative positioning, in addition to the performance of methods, cooperators may provide false data due to attacks or selfishness, which can seriously affect the positioning accuracy. By fully exploiting the characteristics of blockchain and edge computing, this paper proposes a vehicular blockchain-based secure and efficient GPS positioning error evolution sharing framework, which improves vehicle positioning accuracy from ensuring security and credibility of cooperators and data. First, by analyzing the GPS error, a bridge can be established between the sensor-rich vehicles and the common vehicles to achieve cooperation by sharing the positioning error evolution at a specific time and location. Particularly, the positioning error evolution is obtained by a deep neural network (DNN)-based prediction algorithm running on the edge server. We further propose to use blockchain technology for storage and sharing the evolution of positioning errors, mainly to guarantee the security of cooperative vehicles and mobile edge computing nodes (MECNs). In addition, the corresponding smart contracts are designed to automate and efficiently perform storage and sharing tasks as well as solve inconsistencies in time scales.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, diabetes patients were most affected. In the existing healthcare system, medical data is available in paper form or through a central server. Accessing the data from the central system and sharing it with all stakeholders would be a critical task during the pandemic. This research work deals with the design and implementation of a diabetes blockchain consortium. It can help all healthcare stakeholders to efficiently prioritize the needs of diabetes patients during a pandemic, such as oxygen beds, vaccinations, diabetes compensation, telemedicine, 5G-integrated remote location support, and other related records. The Ethereum sandbox simulation design is utilized to secure diabetes patients’ healthcare records. The Interplanetary file system (IPFS) encrypts health data and sends it to the blockchain to ensure the privacy of personal healthcare information. The NEM symbol blockchain is used to develop this consortium as a proof-of-concept (PoC) model. Each stakeholder in a consortium is assigned NEM generated QR code to track records as a distributed ledger. A smart contract designed to run the diabetes blockchain application.

A global pandemic resulting in critical demand for medications and vaccines was an eye-opener in the current era. The intrinsic complexity among the bodies involved in the supply chain results in a lack of data transparency, security, privacy, and reliable communication. The counterfeited drug is an outcome of such limitations that adversely affects a global population. Consecutively, fair allocation and distribution of drugs and vaccines to administer them to a global mass equally is also a significant concern. Blockchain as technology grants an essential platform to track and manage transactions among communicating parties in the supply chain using a peer-to-peer, secured, distributed ledger, removing the need for intermediaries or entrusted third parties. Most existing studies focus on tracking and tracing supply chain systems in a centralized manner, leading to transparency, authenticity, data privacy, and authenticity concerns in healthcare supply chains. In this article, we propose a FAIR blockchain-based approach deploying smart contracts leading to transparent traceability of data and transactions in the healthcare supply chain between the communicating parties We propose an approach that allows fair allocation and distribution of vaccines as per the demand generated from the global population. We present a system architecture and algorithm representing the communication between parties that governs our proposed approach.

However, data owners do not have full ownership of the data after their data are outsourced. Thus, external data management systems are implemented to manage the data. Several kinds of research refer to the use of encryption techniques to prevent unauthorized access to data. Selective encryption aims at supporting selective and private access to outsourced data. However, the combination of this approach and indexing techniques cause confidentiality violations. In this article, a blockchain-based approach to data access is presented by implementing smart contracts over data access. These executable scripts bind users by stating access policies on the data.

The formulated optimization problem is to obtain the maximum profit of the VPP operation in energy trading of a day-ahead market (DAM), and to comply with the required hourly ramp-rate limit of the aggregated power. In this study, DAM price is assumed hourly varying, with reference to New York Independent System Operator (NYISO). The optimal solution of the hourly SPPs' generated power commitments is solved by linear programming (LP). Test results from the case studies with 6 SPPs combined, at most, show that profit per capacity can be improved by 1.22%, and profit coefficient of variation can be improved by 8.14%. Furthermore, the aggregated power characteristics can be more effectively smoothen using the constraints of ramp-rate limit and the bias term of ramp-rate cost.","","978-1-6654-0216-3","10.1109/ICPEI52436.2021.9690673","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9690673","Energy market;Energy trading;Power aggregation;Solar power;Virtual Power Plant","Technological innovation;Renewable energy sources;Costs;Dams;Power transmission;Virtual power plants;Linear programming","energy management systems;linear programming;optimisation;power generation dispatch;power generation economics;power generation scheduling;power markets;pricing;solar power stations","advanced energy management systems;modern power transmission network;solar power integration;virtual power plant;aggregated power characteristics;hourly SPPs' generated power commitments;required hourly ramp-rate limit;power producer;multiple solar power plants;VPP operation;solar power aggregation framework;wholesale energy trading;optimization;power 10.0 MW","","","","16","IEEE","31 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Taming a stray cat is not an easy job and sometimes leads to hostility. Stray cats that are not cared for can contract diseases, some of which can even infect humans, such as febrile fever, pustules, and, in extreme cases, complications that can lead to death. The purpose of this study is to build a monitoring system for the presence of stray cats using IoT (Internet of Things) technology so that animal activists can find out the condition of stray cats and determine the required actions. This system attracts the cat's attention when looking for food so it does not disturb humans. The system’s main controller is a Raspberry Pi microcontroller with three input components, namely a camera and two weight sensors. Pi camera as a camera captures images, while the two weight sensors or load cells determine the amount of feed and water available.

Although the TTP-based paradigm provides customers with convenience, it causes a whole set of inevitable problems such as security threats, privacy vulnerabilities, and censorship. The TTP-based paradigm is not suitable for all modern networks, e.g., 5G and beyond networks, which are been evolving to support ubiquitous, decentralized, and autonomous services. Driven by the vision of blockchain technologies, there has been a paradigm shift in applications, from TTP-based to decentralized-trust-based. Decentralized applications (DApps) with blockchains promise no trust on authorities, tackling the key challenges of security and privacy problems. A main thrust of blockchain research is to explore frameworks and paradigms for decentralizing applications, fostering a number of new designs ranging from network architectures to business models. Therefore, this paper provides a compact and concise survey on the state-of-the-art research of decentralizing applications with blockchain in the 5G and beyond perspective. We provide four burning 5G and beyond challenges and discuss five aspects of motivation for decentralizing applications with blockchain. Then, we define nine fundamental modules of blockchains and explain the potential influence of these modules on decentralization in depth. We also discuss the interrelation between decentralization and some desired blockchain properties. Particularly, we present the capabilities of blockchain for decentralizing applications through reviewing DApps for 5G and beyond. We clearly distinguish three blockchain paradigms and discuss how developers to make right choices for 5G and beyond. Finally, we highlight important learned lessons and open issues in applying blockchain for decentralizing applications.

However, common authorization systems in IoT employ conventional schemes, which suffer from overheads and centralization. Recent research trends suggest that blockchain has the potential to tackle the issues of access control in IoT. However, proposed solutions overlook the importance of building dynamic and flexible access control mechanisms. In this paper, we design a decentralized attribute-based access control mechanism with an auxiliary Trust and Reputation System (TRS) for IoT authorization. Our system progressively quantifies the trust and reputation scores of each node in the network and incorporates the scores into the access control mechanism to achieve dynamic and flexible access control. We design our system to run on a public blockchain, but we separate the storage of sensitive information, such as user’s attributes, to private sidechains for privacy preservation.

Among various abstraction layers of Blockchain architecture, the consensus layer is the core component behind the performance and security measures of the Blockchain network. Consensus mechanisms are a critical component of a Blockchain system’s long-term stability. Consensus forms the core of blockchain technology. Therefore, a range of consensus protocols has been introduced to maximize Blockchain systems’ efficiency and meet application domains’ individual needs. This research paper describes the layered architecture of Blockchain. A comprehensive review of mainstream consensus protocols mainly Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), Proof of Activity (PoA) is presented in the paper. These mainstream consensus protocols have been explained and detailed performance analysis of these consensus protocols has been done. We have proposed a performance matrix of these consensus protocols based on different parameters like Degree of decentralization, Latency, Fault Tolerance Rate, Scalability, etc. Consensus protocols being the core of a strong fault-tolerant secured blockchain system, the proposed work intends to help inappropriate protocol selection and further research on strengthening trust and ownership in the technology. Depending upon different parameters like decentralization which is low in POA compared to other protocols, whereas POW is non-scalable, so depending on the priority of a particular performance parameter, the paper will help in the selection of a specific protocol.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3085187","Umm Al-Qura University through the Deanship of Scientific Research(grant numbers:19-ENG-1-01-0015); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9444429","Blockchain;PoW;PoS;DPoS;PoA;consensus protocol","Consensus protocol;Computer architecture;Peer-to-peer computing;Data models;Smart contracts;Computer science","blockchains;fault tolerant computing;multi-agent systems;protocols","scale mainstream Blockchain consensus protocols;Blockchain innovation;Blockchain architecture;consensus layer;security measures;Blockchain network;consensus mechanisms;blockchain technology;Blockchain systems;inappropriate protocol selection","","32","","49","CCBY","31 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, e-PoS leverages the in-built system operations to promote fair mining practices by penalizing malicious entities.

Analyzing and understanding those discussions could provide insights about the topics of interest to practitioners, and help the software development and research communities better understand the needs and challenges facing developers as they work in this new domain. Prior studies propose the use of LDA to study the Stack Exchange discussions. However, a simplistic use of LDA would capture the topics in discussions blindly without keeping in mind the variety of the dataset and domain-specific concepts. Specifically, LDA is biased towards larger sized corpora; and LDA-derived topics are not linked to higher level domain-specific concepts. We propose an approach that combines balanced LDA (which ensures that the topics are balanced across a domain) with the reference architecture of a domain to capture and compare the popularity and impact of discussion topics across the Stack Exchange communities. Popularity measures the distribution of interest in discussions, and impact gauges the trend of popularity over time. We made a number of interesting observations, including: (1) Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric and Corda are the four most commonly-discussed blockchain platforms on the Stack Exchange communities. (2) A broad range of topics are discussed across the various platforms of distinct layers in our derived reference architecture. (3) The Application layer topics exhibit the highest popularity (33.2 percent) and fastest growth in topic impact since November 2015. (4) The Application, API, Consensus and Network layer topics are discussed across the studied blockchain platforms, but exhibit different distributions in popularity. (5) The impact of architectural layer topics exhibits an upward trend, but is growing at different speeds across the studied blockchain platforms. The breakdown of the topic impact across the architectural layers is relatively stable over time except for the Hyperledger Fabric platform. Based on our findings, we highlighted future directions and provided recommendations for practitioners and researchers.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2019.2921343","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1003904); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61602403); Science and Technology Research and Development Program of China Railway Corporation(grant numbers:P2018X002); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8732384","Empirical study;reference architecture;blockchain;stack overflow;stack exchange","Blockchain;Peer-to-peer computing;Computer architecture;Smart contracts;Programming;Bitcoin","application program interfaces;blockchains;software architecture","Stack Exchange communities;blockchain;Stack Overflow;reference architecture;architectural layer;balanced LDA;application layer;programming Q&A Web sites;software development;bitcoin;Ethereum;hyperledger fabric;Corda;API;network layer;level domain-specific concepts","","23","","95","IEEE","6 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Trusting a third party has its own ramifications and results in a centralized architecture; therefore, this article addresses these issues by designing a Blockchain-based distributed IoT architecture that uses hash chains for secure key management. The proposed architecture exploits the key characteristics of the Blockchain technology, such as openness, immutability, traceability, and fault tolerance, to ensure data privacy in IoT scenarios and, thus, provides a secure environment for communication. This article also proposes a scheme for secure and efficient key generation and management for mutual authentication between communication entities.

Frequent incidences of fraudulent practices expose lack of transparency in agri-food supply chains, causing concerns related to economic losses, eroding consumer trust and enterprise brand value. Traditionally associated with cryptocurrencies, banking and finance, blockchains are now being applied in the agri-food sector to address supply chain-related challenges. This article examines the question: How blockchain technology facilitates transparency in agri-food supply chains? Primary attributes of blockchain, namely traceability, immutability, auditability, and provenance, promote transparency in supply chains. Using thematic analysis, the following three areas were identified for implementing blockchain in agri-food supply chains: first, agri-food distribution; second, agri-food origin and sourcing; third, agri-food safety and quality. By cross-mapping thematic areas with primary attributes, our analysis resulted in classification of 25 uses cases. Preliminary findings of this study highlight blockchain-enabled transparency via contemporary uses cases in conceptual, proof-of-concept and commercial stages. It is imperative to sift through the hype and scrutinize limitations of the technology which could interfere with its adoption, deployment, and scalability in agri-food supply chains.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2021.3110903","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9578927","Agri-food;blockchain;digital technologies;industry 4.0;provenance;supply chain (SC);thematic analysis;traceability;transparency;use cases.","Blockchains;Supply chains;Smart contracts;Codes;Peer-to-peer computing;Distributed ledger;Costs","","","","17","","","IEEE","18 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Previous works focus on data sharing between vehicles, but a large amount of data will lead to redundant transmission and network congestion. In addition, security and privacy issues prevent these nodes from participating in the sharing process. Knowledge is extracted from data through machine learning (ML) and shared in the form of small-scale well-trained model parameters, which improves collaborative learning more effectively and relieves network pressure. While traditional ML algorithms are not suitable for distributed IoV with local characteristics. Based on this, this paper first divides the vehicles into multiple regions and proposes a Regional Federated Learning (RFL) framework, in which all regions maintain their own learning models, i.e. knowledge. We design a reputation mechanism to measure the reliability of vehicles participating in RFL. To address the security challenges brought by the untrusted centralized trading market, we propose a blockchain-enhanced knowledge trading framework, in which an authorized market agency coordinates the trading quickly. We model the optimal pricing mechanism as a non-cooperative game, taking into account the competition among all knowledge providers. Numerical simulation shows that the proposed reputation mechanism improves the accuracy of knowledge up to 18%, and the optimal knowledge pricing mechanism effectively increases the utility of market.","1558-2612","978-1-7281-9505-6","10.1109/WCNC49053.2021.9417347","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai; Chinese Academy of Sciences; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9417347","Regional Federated Learning;reputation;blockchain;Knowledge trading;pricing mechanism","Knowledge engineering;Smart contracts;Collaboration;Pricing;Games;Collaborative work;Numerical simulation","cloud computing;computer network security;data privacy;game theory;groupware;learning (artificial intelligence);peer-to-peer computing;pricing","reputation-based regional federated learning;blockchain-enhanced IoV;process environmental data;collaborative manner;redundant transmission;network congestion;privacy issues;sharing process;small-scale well-trained model parameters;network pressure;distributed IoV;local characteristics;multiple regions;RFL;reputation mechanism;security challenges;untrusted centralized trading market;blockchain-enhanced knowledge trading framework;optimal pricing mechanism;knowledge providers;optimal knowledge pricing mechanism;regional federated learning framework","","15","","13","IEEE","5 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Payment channels are one of the most promising solutions to address these problems, as they allow the parties of the channel to perform arbitrarily many payments in a peer-to-peer fashion while uploading only two transactions on the blockchain. This concept has been generalized into payment channel networks where a path of payment channels is used to settle the payment between two users that might not share a direct channel between them. However, this approach requires the active involvement of each user in the path, making the system less reliable (they might be offline), more expensive (they charge fees per payment), and slower (intermediaries need to be actively involved in the payment). To mitigate this issue, recent work has introduced the concept of virtual channels (IEEE S&P’19), which involve intermediaries only in the initial creation of a bridge between payer and payee, who can later on independently perform arbitrarily many off-chain transactions. Unfortunately, existing constructions are only available for Ethereum, as they rely on its account model and Turing-complete scripting language. The realization of virtual channels in other blockchain technologies with limited scripting capabilities, like Bitcoin, was so far considered an open challenge.In this work, we present the first virtual channel protocols that are built on the UTXO-model and require a scripting language supporting only a digital signature scheme and a timelock functionality, being thus backward compatible with virtually every cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin. We formalize the security properties of virtual channels as an ideal functionality in the Universal Composability framework and prove that our protocol constitutes a secure realization thereof. We have prototyped and evaluated our protocol on the Bitcoin blockchain, demonstrating its efficiency: for n sequential payments, they require an off-chain exchange of 9+2n transactions or a total of 3524+695n bytes, with no on-chain footprint in the optimistic case. This is a substantial improvement compared to routing payments in a payment channel network, which requires 8n transactions with a total of 3026n bytes to be exchanged.","2375-1207","978-1-7281-8934-5","10.1109/SP40001.2021.00097","Ministry of Education; Ministry of Education; European Research Council; Austrian Science Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9519487","Blockchain-scalability;Off-chain;Virtual-Channels","Bridges;Privacy;Smart contracts;Buildings;Bitcoin;Virtual machining;Blockchains","authoring languages;computer network security;cryptocurrencies;cryptographic protocols;digital signatures;peer-to-peer computing","payment channel network;direct channel;off-chain transactions;virtual channel protocols;virtually every cryptocurrency;Bitcoin blockchain;n sequential payments;routing payments;current permissionless cryptocurrencies;transaction rate;arbitrarily many payments;peer-to-peer fashion;Bitcoin compatible virtual channels;Turing complete scripting language","","12","","29","IEEE","26 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, involving multiple drones from different service providers elevates the chance of collision during flights. Second, drones may hamper the privacy of citizens by unauthorized access to private and restricted areas. In order to solve the aforementioned issues, we propose a blockchain-based policy enforcement mechanism in the drone-based delivery service systems. At first, the mechanism will set policies to establish pre-allocated flight paths for different drones at different times to avoid collisions, and ensure the privacy of citizens by restricting their access to unauthorized areas. Later, the blockchain will enforce the policies to monitor compliance of the drone flights and identify non-compliant drone services to penalize corresponding service providers.

Blockchain technology proposes a distributed and transparent administration by employing multiple parties to maintain consensus on an immutable ledger.

The framework promotes data quality by assessing input data sets, effectively manages access control, and presents data provenance and activity monitoring. We introduce an assessment model that includes reputation, endorsement, and confidence factors to evaluate data quality. We also suggest an adaptive solution to determine the number of transaction validators based on the computed trust value. The proposed data trust framework addresses both data owners' and data users' concerns by ensuring the trustworthiness and quality of the data at origin and ethical and secure usage of the data at the end. A comprehensive experimental study indicates the presented system effectively handles a large number of transactions with low latency.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3091327","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9461755","Blockchain;data trust;data sharing;distributed;access control","Blockchain;Smart contracts;Peer-to-peer computing;Access control;Distributed databases;Organizations;Law","authorisation;blockchains;data privacy;transaction processing;trusted computing","data trust framework;blockchain technology;data owners;data users;trustworthy data sharing;data quality;data provenance;activity monitoring;adaptive transaction validation;immutable ledger;end-to-end framework;access control;assessment model;confidence factor;endorsement factor;reputation factor;transaction validator;computed trust value","","8","","35","CCBY","21 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This notion of a level of autonomy is particularly important for consumer awareness as these autonomous devices and applications scale out to mass-market services. The societal impact from the operationalization of these technologies can be significant in terms of safety, security, privacy, and the consequences of failures.

Differential privacy has been widely studied in the literature to protect the privacy of users’ information. The privacy parameter bounds the information about the data set leaked by the noisy output. Oftentimes, a data set needs to be used for answering multiple queries, so the level of privacy protection may degrade as more queries are answered. Thus, it is crucial to keep track of privacy budget spending, which should not exceed the given limit of privacy budget. Moreover, if a query has been answered before and is asked again on the same data set, we may reuse the previous noisy response for the current query to save the privacy cost. In view of the above, we design an algorithm to reuse previous noisy responses if the same query is asked repeatedly. In particular, considering that different requests of the same query may have different privacy requirements, our algorithm can set the optimal reuse fraction of the old noisy response and add new noise to minimize the accumulated privacy cost. Furthermore, we design and implement a blockchain-based system for tracking and saving differential-privacy cost. As a result, the owner of the data set will have full knowledge about how the data set has been used and be confident that no new privacy cost will be incurred for answering queries once the specified privacy budget is exhausted.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3058209","Nanyang Technological University (NTU) Startup Grant; Alibaba–NTU Singapore Joint Research Institute (JRI); Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund(grant numbers:Tier 1 RG128/18,Tier 1 RG115/19,Tier 1 RT07/19,Tier 1 RT01/19,Tier 2 MOE2019-T2-1-176); NTU–WASP Joint Project; Singapore National Research Foundation (NRF) under its Strategic Capability Research Centres Funding Initiative: Strategic Centre for Research in Privacy-Preserving Technologies and Systems (SCRIPTS); Energy Research Institute @NTU (ERIAN); Singapore NRF National Satellite of Excellence, Design Science and Technology for Secure Critical Infrastructure(grant numbers:NSoE DeST-SCI2019-0012); AI Singapore (AISG) 100 Experiments (100E) Programme; NTU Project for Large Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) Research Platform; National Research Foundation (NRF), Singapore, through Singapore Energy Market Authority (EMA), Energy Resilience(grant numbers:NRF2017EWT-EP003-041); Singapore NRF(grant numbers:NRF2015-NRF-ISF001-2277); Singapore NRF National Satellite of Excellence, Design Science and Technology for Secure Critical Infrastructure(grant numbers:NSoE DeST-SCI2019-0007); A*STAR-NTU-SUTD Joint Research Grant on Artificial Intelligence for the Future of Manufacturing(grant numbers:RGANS1906); Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program and Nanyang Technological University (WASP/NTU)(grant numbers:M4082187 (4080)); Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE)(grant numbers:Tier 1 (RG16/20)); Alibaba Group through Alibaba Innovative Research (AIR) Program and Alibaba–NTU Singapore Joint Research Institute (JRI); National Research Foundation, Singapore, under its Strategic Capability Research Centres Funding Initiative; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9351532","Blockchain;data analytics;differential privacy (DP);Gaussian mechanism","Privacy;Blockchain;Noise measurement;Smart contracts;Differential privacy;Internet of Things;Servers","blockchains;cost reduction;data privacy;query processing","optimal reuse fraction;differential-privacy cost saving;differential-privacy cost tracking;privacy requirements;blockchain-based system;query answering;noisy response;privacy budget spending;privacy protection;noisy output;data set;privacy parameter","","8","","66","IEEE","9 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Trusted certificate authorities (CAs) can issue a valid certificate for any domain name. Although CA is supposed to be trusted by a client if the certificate issued to the client links to the chain of trust (e.g., root CA or subordinate CA). By compromising any of the latter (e.g., root CAs or subordinate CAs) an attacker can jeopardize the security of the entire system. Moreover, third-party CAs have to be trusted by domain owners. Currently, the trust is not balanced among the entities involved in the certificate authentication and issuance process (i.e., CAs and domain owners). To counter this problem approaches such as Domain authentication name entity (DANE) and Certificate Authority Authorization (CAA) offer additional securities for domain authentication. However, these approaches depend upon DNS/DNSSEC infrastructure which requires complex requirements for deployment as well as the adoption rate has been low. In this paper, we design, implement a robust and scalable domain authentication scheme based on blockchain technology with privacy-preserving features for low-constrained devices (e.g., mobile, browser, and IoT devices). The proposed system records a set of trusted CAs each associated with a specific domain in the blockchain. That is, each CA has to first verify if it is trusted to perform the actual issuance process. We compare our scheme with existing authentication methods and show that it requires less storage capacity and low bandwidth to authenticate certificates than other methods.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2021.3069128","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB0803600); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672060); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:M21040); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9387577","blockchain;certificates;authentication;Validation","Blockchain;Authentication;Security;Browsers;Smart contracts;Bitcoin;Public key","blockchains","client links;scalable domain authentication scheme;security failures;trusted certificate authorities;blockchain-based domain certificate authentication methods;public key infrastructures certificate authentication methods;trusted CA;certificate authority authorization;third-party CA;subordinate CA;root CA;CAA;DANE;domain authentication name entity;DNS-DNSSEC infrastructure","","7","","46","IEEE","26 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To efficiently utilize this data, markets must be developed where data can be traded in real time. Blockchain technology offers a potential platform for these types of markets. However, previous proposals using blockchain technology either require trusted third parties such as data brokers, or necessitate a large number of on-chain transactions to operate, incurring excessive overhead costs. This paper proposes a trustless data trading system that minimizes both the risk of fraud and the number of transactions performed on chain. In this system, data producers and consumers come to binding agreements while trading data off chain and they only settle on chain when a deposit or withdrawal of funds is required. A credit mechanism is also developed to further reduce the incurred fees. Additionally, the proposed marketplace is benchmarked on a private Ethereum network running on a lab-scale testbed and the proposed credit system is simulated so to analyze its risks and benefits.","","978-1-6654-3578-9","10.1109/ICBC51069.2021.9461127","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9461127","IoT;blockchain;data marketplace;mechanism design","Simulation;Scalability;Smart contracts;Ecosystems;Blockchain;Pricing;Games","blockchains;Internet of Things","excessive overhead costs;trustless data trading system;data producers;credit system;cost-effective blockchain-based IoT data marketplaces;credit invariant;Internet of Things devices;blockchain technology;on-chain transactions;trusted third parties;private Ethereum network;lab-scale testbed","","7","","24","IEEE","24 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With sharding, the processing of a transaction might not be completed locally within a node and potentially requires involvement of multiple shards. Such cross-shards transactions have a negative impact on system performance and are frequent with traditional state partition solutions which are often based on a simple mapping of data into shards. By locating together parts of the system state accessed by frequent transactions, the amount of cross-shard transactions can be reduced. On the other hand, the representation of such particular mappings can be memory intensive. In this article, we study traffic-aware sharding that can be described in memory-efficient mappings. We first survey existing mapping schemes in common blockchains. We indicate the tradeoff between the size of the mapping of data to shards and the required transaction processing time and suggest algorithms for finding memory-light sharding of low cross-shard rate. We generalize the approach towards an efficient incremental computation of shards and probabilistic representation of the mapping to shards.

IoT's fundamental components, including the wireless sensor networks and the internet, have an unsecured foundation that leads to DoS attacks, namely, sinkhole, blackhole, and grey hole attacks. To maintain the integrity and security of the IoT networks, many researchers implemented distributed ledgers in IoT environments. In this paper, we designed a hybrid framework between blockchain and IoT devices; the aim is to secure data transmission in IoT networks using blockchain technology to defend against DoS attacks. Our framework is called HFSDT-IoT. The method proposed in this paper consists of two phases to maintain security in the IoT. In the first phase, both a list of attackers and a safe list based on the Ethereum Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol is used, which complemented by utilizing the proposed IDSs Intrusion Detection System to discover malicious things. In the second phase, to decrease the obstacles in facilitating communication between blockchains, the inter-blockchain communication model creates a network of multiple blockchains with secp256k1 encryption used for heterogeneous blockchains. The experimental results of simulated scenarios show the HFSDT-IoT strategy can achieve better results when DoS attacks were launched compared to other blockchain-based methods, namely Bubble of Trust and Credibility Verification Method.","","978-1-6654-4067-7","10.1109/IEMTRONICS52119.2021.9422587","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9422587","Blockchain;Security attacks;Proof-of-Stake;Ethereum;Internet of Things (IoTs);HFSDT-IoT;Intrusion Detection System IDS","Wireless sensor networks;Mechatronics;Distributed ledger;Smart contracts;Intrusion detection;Blockchain;Encryption","blockchains;computer network security;Internet;Internet of Things;protocols;wireless sensor networks","grey hole attacks;blockchain technology;DoS attacks;malicious things;inter-blockchain communication model;multiple blockchains;heterogeneous blockchains;HFSDT-IoT strategy;blockchain-based methods;data transmission security;Internet of Things environment;blockchain approach;wireless sensor networks;sinkhole hole attacks;blackhole attacks;IoT environment;Ethereum Proof-of-Stake protocol;Ethereum PoS protocol;Internet;bubble of trust method;credibility verification method","","6","","17","IEEE","14 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, the centralized management architecture of the CBRS system cannot efficiently manage very large scale and large quantity of users, and may also suffer severe security and privacy issues.

Since its inception in 2008, it has been applied in different areas mainly to maintain data integrity and consistency. Blockchain has been tailored to secure data due to its data immutability and distributive technology. Despite the high success rate in data security, the inability to identify compromised insider nodes is one of the significant problems encountered in blockchain architectures. A Blockchain network is made up of nodes that initiate, verify and validate transactions. If compromised, these nodes can manipulate submitted transactions, inject fake transactions, or retrieve unauthorized information that might eventually compromise the stored data’s integrity and consistency. This paper proposes a novel method of detecting these compromised blockchain nodes using a server-side authentication process and thwart their activities before getting updated in the blockchain ledger. In evaluating the proposed system, we perform four common insider attacks, which fall under the following three categories: (1) Those attacks targeting the Blockchain to bring it down. (2) the attacks that attempt to inject fake data into the database. (3) The attacks that attempt to hijack or retrieve unauthorized data. We described how we implement the attacks and how our architecture detects them before they impact the network. Finally, we displayed the attack detection time for each attack and compared our approach with other existing methods.","","978-1-6654-0304-7","10.1109/ISNCC52172.2021.9615799","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9615799","Blockchain;Cyberattack;Compromised nodes;detection time;Intrusion Detection System;Transaction;data injection.","Computers;Databases;Data security;Data integrity;Smart contracts;Authentication;Computer architecture","authorisation;blockchains;data integrity;telecommunication security","data security;data breach;data integrity;secure data;data immutability;distributive technology;compromised insider nodes;blockchain architectures;inject fake transactions;compromised blockchain nodes;blockchain ledger;common insider attacks;fake data;unauthorized data;attack detection time;Blockchain network;blockchain network","","4","","23","IEEE","25 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are various versions of zk-SNARK, among them, Quadratic Arithmetic Program (QAP)-based zk-SNARK has been widely used in practice, especially in Blockchain technology. This is attributed to two desirable features; its fixed-size proof and the very light computation load of the verifier. However, the computation load of the prover in QAP-based zkSNARKs is very heavy, even-though it is designed to be very efficient. This load can be beyond the prover’s computation power to handle, and has to be offloaded to some external servers. In the existing offloading solutions, either (i) the load of computation, offloaded to each sever, is a fraction of the prover’s primary computation (e.g., DZIK), however the servers need to be trusted, (ii) the servers are not required to be trusted, but the computation complexity imposed to each one is the same as the prover’s primary computation (e.g., Trinocchio). In this paper, we present a scheme, which has the benefits of both solutions. In particular, we propose a secure multi-party proof generation algorithm where the prover can delegate its task to  $N $  servers, where (i) even if a group of  $T \in \mathbb {N}$  servers,  $T < N$ , collude, they cannot gain any information about the secret value  $v$ , (ii) the computation complexity of each server is less than  $1/(N-T)$  of the prover’s primary computation.

It is a costly, lengthy, and time-consuming procedure as university authorities invest millions of dollars in maintaining the entire process each year. The employer also takes plenty of time to verify the authenticity of the applicant's certificate. The current certification system provides traditional certificates to the candidates. That's why certificates can be tampered with and lost at any time. Moreover, counterfeiting the certificates by scammers and issued by many illegal institutions makes the process hazardous. People frequently lie about their degrees and qualifications by counterfeiting certificates. A fake certificate generated by skillful scammers is always tough to identify and address as the original one. Therefore, there is a crucial need to upgrade the certification and verification process. This paper introduced a Blockchain-based decentralized DIUcerts platform that offers an easy way to issue, check, and verify educational certificates. Additionally, in DIUcerts, data doesn't have to be stored in one place as each certificate's information is kept in an individual file; entire issuance and verifications are done through the Ethereum platform. With this infrastructure, the cost of maintaining a Blockchain-based certificate verification system could be highly minimized as compared to building a similar application on a centralized database. As a result, DIUcerts can lead to better security, cost savings, and a time-saving platform for educational certificate verification.","","978-1-7281-8595-8","10.1109/ICCCNT51525.2021.9579533","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9579533","Blockchain;Decentralized Application;Educational Certificate Verification;Document Verification;Certificate Issuance;Blockchain Technology","Costs;Databases;Smart contracts;Buildings;Maintenance engineering;Servers;Security","authorisation;blockchains;certification","educational certificate verification;Blockchain-based solution;educational certificates;certificate legitimacy;costly time-consuming procedure;current certification system;traditional certificates;fake certificate;DIUcerts;blockchain-based certificate verification system;lengthy time-consuming procedure;applicant certificate;certificates counterfeiting;illegal institution;hazardous process;certification process;verification process;Ethereum platform","","3","","33","IEEE","3 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To incentivize the collaboration among selfish peers, we record the identity information of participating brokers on a ledger list. However, blockchain cannot guarantee the integrity of such a routing ledger directly. Therefore, we design a ledger safeguard mechanism, along with reward policies, to avoid the ledger list being tampered with or modified by dishonest brokers.

However, digital signatures entail privacy infringements because it is possible to verify such signatures only when all the data are disclosed to the verifier. Zero-knowledge proofs are considered to be capable of solving this privacy problem. In general, a zero-knowledge proof can be established even if the prover hides the information required in the verification process from the verifier. Zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge (ZK-SNARK), a prevalent zero-knowledge proof, has been optimized to generate non-interactive and succinct proofs; nevertheless, the generation of proofs is excessively time consuming, making the application of ZK-SNARK impractical in most scenarios. In this paper, we show that existing cryptographic algorithms, such as a one-way hash function or digital signature, can be combined with a zero knowledge proof. Particularly, we propose the multi-argument zero-knowledge argument (MAZKA) algorithm, which can verify data by exposing only the part to be verified and also verify that the part of data has not been manipulated compared to the original. In addition, the proposed algorithm satisfies the adaptive proof of knowledge, perfect zero-knowledze and combinatorial succinctness conditions.","","978-1-6654-2318-2","10.1109/IMCOM51814.2021.9377407","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9377407","Digital signature;zero-knowledge proof;multiparty multi-argument;direct product","Hash functions;Privacy;Smart contracts;Public key;Information management;Zero knowledge proof;Digital signatures","computational complexity;cryptography;data privacy;digital signatures;formal verification","multiargument zero-knowledge argument;partially verifiable multiparty multiargument zero-knowledge proof;digital signatures;succinct proofs;privacy infringements;zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge","","2","","13","IEEE","17 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Personal comprehensive credit score as a measure to promote social governance is closely related to personal privacy. Although there are currently credit score calculation systems for various application scenarios, these systems almost ignore user privacy protection, which leads to user information leakage or abuse. The combination of zero-knowledge proof and personal credit score calculation has been studied by a number of researchers at the present stage. However, all data are provided by users directly in the current schemes, which did not consider the data authenticity under the situation that users provided false data. In this paper, we utilize zero-knowledge proof to design a novel privacy protection scheme for personal credit score calculation, taking into account the authenticity verification of multi-dimensional user data. In addition, our scheme also proposes the concept of a universal verification platform based on blockchain for personal credit scores. This platform has more substantial applicability and versatility for any qualified institution that requires querying and verifying user’s credit scores.

However, it is beneficial for time-sensitive applications, where the required delay is minimum, but not well suited for mission-critical applications, where the required delay is negligible. To fulfill this requirement, the authors worldwide started integrating FC with device-to-device (D2D) communication. But it was potentially affected by massive interference, which does not improve the total sum rate and secrecy capacity of the wireless channel. Motivated from these gaps, in this paper, we propose a blockchain-enabled cooperative D2D-assisted FC scheme under imperfect CSI in the presence of an eavesdropper called Block-D2D to enhance the total sum rate and secrecy capacity. We used non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme for D2D pairs to improve the aforementioned characteristics. Still, the data on the device is not fully secure, which can be modified by any malicious user. This can be protected using blockchain technology, which is immutable, secure, and trusted. To improve the secrecy capacity of the network and spectral efficiency, we used a cooperative game theory. Simulation results show that the elevated performance of the NOMA-based Block-D2D scheme compared to the conventional OFDMA scheme in terms of sum rate, secrecy capacity, and system throughput.","2694-2941","978-1-7281-9441-7","10.1109/ICCWorkshops50388.2021.9473524","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9473524","Blockchain;device-to-device communication;fog computing;NOMA","Wireless communication;NOMA;Spectral efficiency;Conferences;Smart contracts;Mission critical systems;Interference","cellular radio;cloud computing;cooperative communication;frequency division multiple access;game theory;multi-access systems;OFDM modulation;resource allocation;telecommunication security;wireless channels","blockchain-enabled;D2D-assisted fog computing scheme;imperfect CSI;cloud computing services;reliable access;stored data;time-sensitive applications;required delay;mission-critical applications;device-to-device communication;massive interference;total sum rate;secrecy capacity;FC scheme;nonorthogonal multiple access scheme;blockchain technology;NOMA-based Block-D2D scheme;conventional OFDMA scheme","","1","","15","IEEE","9 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The introduction of blockchain tokens could now offer a major contribution to making this happen. Blockchain tokens can be representations of real-life assets or rights and are, therefore, central for connecting blockchains to real world applications. Despite their pivotal role, their mainstream adoption is still lagging behind. One reason for this is that companies struggle to develop relevant use cases. They are hampered by the rapid development of the complex technology and the lack of development processes. Existing development processes no longer apply to the new decentralized structure of token use cases. As existing research on token systems is either too technical by focusing on a very detailed description of a single use case only or too general by providing token typologies without implementation guidance, companies have no choice but trial and error. It turned out that there is a lack of structured approaches or best practices for the development of token systems. To solve this problem, we follow a design science research approach and develop a framework that guides the design of token use cases. It provides decision support for all steps of the design process and further comprises basic token types which can be used to develop standardized modules. This approach leads to a faster and cheaper development process. We build this framework based on an extensive literature review, enhance it with expert interviews and finally validate its applicability by using it to implement a decentralized parking system based on tokens.","","978-1-6654-3485-0","10.1109/DAPPS52256.2021.00009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9566197","Blockchain;Token Economy;dApps;Automotive;Token Development;Framework;Design Science Research","Codes;Smart contracts;Prototypes;Focusing;Companies;Iterative methods;Decision trees","blockchains;cryptocurrencies;decision making;decision support systems;formal specification","token design framework;blockchain technology;mainstream application;blockchain tokens;mainstream adoption;relevant use cases;complex technology;token use cases;token systems;single use case;token typologies;structured approaches;best practices;design science research approach;design process;basic token types;faster development process;cheaper development process;Bitcoin;emerging technology","","","","39","IEEE","20 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The answers are probably no. Whether the underlying code is law is for debate, but it is not yet applicable to Defi and stablecoins. The law would undoubtedly play a positive role in improving the stability of stablecoin. Through this paper, we focus on the consumer protection aspect of stablecoin legislation and regulation. We set out to analyse the nature of stablecoins in a legal sense. We first survey the legislative practice of cryptocurrencies in multiple jurisdictions and extract proposals specifically for stablecoins for comparative analysis propose how to best regulate stablecoins. The definition of “stable” is explored from three critical aspects: price stability, collateral stability and permissionless. Finally, we conclude by proposing a general legislative framework for stablecoins.

The exponential advancement of blockchain technologies facilitates wellness for the General population, medical records and patient knowledge included. This technology provides treatment professionals and patients with detailed and unchanging details and access to EHRs free of charge. In this article, we introduce an attribute-based signature scheme with several authorities to ensure that the blockchain-encapsulated EHRs are legitimate, where a patient endorses an attribute message and does not share details other than the proof he has attested to them. By swapping the hidden pseudorandom feature seeds between the authorities, the protocol resists N-1 deceptive authorities to attack conspiracies. We also formally show that this multiple authority attribute-based signature approach(MAABS) is protected in a random oracle paradigm by imperfection and absolute privacy in the presumptions of bilinear Diffie-Hellman.

However, the requirements of collateral and credit history are quite burdensome for some users. Nowadays, with more than 55% of the global population using social media [6], there is a lot of public personal data. This data could be used as an alternative risk mitigator for lending. There are many inferences that can be drawn from the users’ social media accounts about their professional behavior and reliability, allowing us to derive the users’ social trustworthiness. We propose to calculate a “social score” based on the social media data of a user. Our contribution is to develop an Ethereum blockchain-enabled fully decentralized lending platform that relies on this score.

This disease known as COVID-19 caused more than 180 million cases including more than 4 million deaths. Numerous false reports, misinformation, and unsolicited fears in regards to coronavirus, are being circulated regularly since the outbreak of the COVID-19. We can solve some of the problems of the pandemic with new technologies like blockchain, therefore we can control its spread until an effective and affordable vaccine is found. Blockchain can combat pandemics by enabling early detection of outbreaks, protecting user privacy, and ensuring reliable medical supply chain during the outbreak tracking. When ill people are detected, it is possible to quickly and accurately share their diagnostic information and clinical presentation with blockchain. We can also hide patients’ identity while sharing that information. Anonymization is supported in blockchain and it’s stronger than other techniques. Moreover, blockchain is transparent so that every disease event can be kept tabs on transparently. There are a lot of blockchain solutions in literature which is proposed recently to combat COVID-19-like pandemics. In this study, we aim to give the details of blockchain and why we can use it for light against pandemics and review proposed solutions.

The model is a two-stage Stackelberg game in which each stage forms a sub-game. In stage I, pools are the leaders who assign a computing power to be consumed by miners. In stage II, miners decide of their power consumption and distribution. They find themselves in a social dilemma in which they must choose between mining in solo, therefore prioritizing their individual preferences, and participating in a pool for the collective interest. The model relies on a pool protocol based on a simulated game in which the miners compete for the reward won by the pool. The solutions for the stage I sub-game and the simulated protocol game are unique and stable Nash equilibriums while the stage II sub-game leads to a stable cooperative equilibrium only when miners choose their strategies according to certain criteria. We conclude that the cooperative optimal mining model has the potential to favor Bitcoin decentralization and stability. Mainly, the social dilemma faced by miners together with the balance of incentives ensure a certain distribution of the network computing power between pools and solo miners, while equilibriums in the game solutions provide stability to the system.","","978-1-6654-3924-4","10.1109/BRAINS52497.2021.9569832","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9569832","Bitcoin;game theory;optimal mining;social dilemma;cooperation;decentralization;stability","Power demand;Computational modeling;Stability criteria;Smart contracts;Bitcoin;Games;Nash equilibrium","cryptocurrencies;data mining;financial data processing;game theory;optimisation","two-stage Stackelberg game;sub-game;pool protocol;Bitcoin mining;protocol game;cooperative optimal mining;Nash equilibriums","","","","20","IEEE","25 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proximity service (prose) proposed by Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is a new technology that allows LTE terminals to communicate directly through sharing cell network resources without infrastructure. It can improve spectrum efficiency of the communication system, and reduce power consumption. But at present, there is very few application of proximity service in vertical industry, which is mainly attributed to two reasons: 1. Lack of effective incentive mechanism to drive users to share network resources; 2. Lack of secure and fair solution to realize network resource sharing in the mistrust and weak trust environment. In order to solve these two problems and improve the efficiency of proximity service communication resource sharing, this paper proposes a technical scheme of prose resource sharing based on blockchain. First of all, based on the research progress of proximity service, a technology scheme of prose resource sharing based on blockchain is proposed. Then, the specific use case of the scheme in mobile communication scenario is analyzed, and the corresponding incentive mechanism is designed. Finally, the future research direction of the scheme is proposed including designing edge computing nodes, and considering the security enhancement solution with TEE.","","978-1-6654-2518-6","10.1109/ICCASIT53235.2021.9633703","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9633703","blockchain;proximity service;resource sharing;technical solution;mobile communication;motivation model","Wireless communication;Privacy;Scalability;Communication industry;Smart contracts;Blockchains;Safety","6G mobile communication;Long Term Evolution;power consumption;resource allocation;telecommunication power management;telecommunication security","blockchain;technology scheme;mobile communication scenario;future research direction;network resource sharing scheme;intelligent terminals;massive access;communication capacity demands;cellular frequency reuse;Third Generation Partnership Project;LTE terminals;cell network resources;communication system;proximity service communication resource sharing;5G wireless communication;6G wireless communication;power consumption;edge computing nodes;security enhancement solution","","","","16","IEEE","10 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A consequence of its popularity has been the growth of processing and data storage requirements for any node participating in the Ethereum blockchain network. For constrained devices such requirements are often infeasible to meet. To cater for such nodes, a so-called light protocol has been proposed for Ethereum where the responsibility of maintaining a correct state representation is delegated to light protocol servers. Previous research has identified dependence on external state management as a potential security vulnerability that exclusively impacts light nodes. Although a simple mitigation strategy is available, it comes at the expense of increased latency. In this work, we propose a new Ethereum node type, which we call a subset node, as an extension of the light protocol. Our proposal allows subset nodes to gain a lower latency than a pure light node with comparable or even higher security assurances by tracking and evaluating only a subset of all of the transactions issued on the blockchain. We provide a formal proof on the correctness of the blockchain state used by the subset node under the proposed model. To evaluate the practical feasibility of the subset node model, we analyze one year of historical transaction data from Ethereum, and demonstrate that a subset node tracking the state of a single account can achieve a significant reduction in storage and computational requirements when compared to a full node.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3101717","European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme(grant numbers:779984); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9502687","Blockchain;Ethereum;transactions;transaction dependencies;light protocol;constrained devices","Blockchains;Protocols;Smart contracts;Security;Servers;Proposals;Peer-to-peer computing","cryptographic protocols","subset node model;historical transaction data;subset node tracking;permissionless blockchains;data storage requirements;Ethereum blockchain network;correct state representation;external state management;security vulnerability;Ethereum node type;pure light node;light blockchain protocol servers","","","","53","CCBY","30 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Common Knowledge Base (CKB) is a public permissionless blockchain and the base layer of N ervos Network, which is gaining popularity in recent years. It adopts a novel con-sensus protocol to overcome two shortcomings of Bitcoin: the low transaction processing throughput and the vulnerability to selfish mining attacks. Considering the high-security requirements in CKB application scenarios, it is essential to provide formalization and verification of the safety and security properties of the CKB blockchain. In this paper, we provide a formal model of CKB consensus protocol in the theorem prover Coq. Fundamental components of the protocol are implemented, including the block structure, the two-step transaction confirmation mechanism, and the peer-to-peer asynchronous network. We also use Coq to establish the quiescent consistency property of the consensus protocol, which is a kind of eventual consensus that all the participants agree on the same ledger when there are no inflight messages.","2693-9371","978-1-6654-7836-6","10.1109/QRS-C55045.2021.00100","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62172019,61772038); Guangdong Science and Technology Department(grant numbers:2018B010107004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9741965","theorem proving;blockchain;consensus protocol","Smart contracts;Semantics;Software quality;Reliability theory;Throughput;Consensus protocol;Peer-to-peer computing","blockchains;computer network security;cryptographic protocols;data mining;formal verification;peer-to-peer computing;theorem proving;transaction processing","CKB consensus protocol;distributed execution environment;malicious attacks;Common Knowledge Base;public permissionless blockchain;low transaction processing throughput;selfish mining attacks;high-security requirements;CKB application scenarios;security properties;CKB blockchain;formal model;theorem prover Coq;block structure;peer-to-peer asynchronous network;eventual consensus;Nervos network;quiescent consistency property;Bitcoin","","","","30","IEEE","1 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To alleviate such security and privacy issues, the interaction of blockchain with IoT systems has acquired significant attention these days because blockchain has presented an underlying mechanism of immutability, audibility, and transparency for data storage. However due to the intrinsic nature of a blockchain containing complex mathematical proof concepts such as Merkle Hash Tree and Proof of Work (PoW) which demands high computation power making it less viable for IoT devices to be connected with. To overcome these issues, a novel scheme is proposed in this paper, which deploys private by design based blockchain architecture for IoT devices using low complex consensus algorithm and low computation cryptographic mechanism which suits best for IoT devices to address the privacy concerns. Unlike the traditional blockchain network in which every node maintained a copy of the transaction, we have proposed a new architecture in which block validation and block generation logic has been modified so that a transaction will be limited to the trusted recipient only. The proposed scheme outperforms the contemporary approaches both in terms of throughput and latency as observed through simulation results as well as maintaining the privacy concerns which will encourage the actual implementation of IoT applications in the real world. Moreover, the evaluation analysis demonstrate that the approach has major potential in a trusted network computing system and provides a substantial secure environment for IoT users.","","978-1-6654-2182-9","10.1109/BCCA53669.2021.9657016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9657016","BlockhChain;Consensus mechanism;Distributed system;Internet of things;security;authentication","Performance evaluation;Privacy;Simulation;Smart contracts;Consensus algorithm;Computer architecture;Throughput","blockchains;computer network security;data privacy;Internet of Things;message authentication;telecommunication security","security;privacy issues;IoT systems;IoT devices;blockchain architecture;privacy concerns;traditional blockchain network;IoT applications;IoT users;BlockChain utilized privacy-preservation mechanism","","","","38","IEEE","30 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We conceptualized a blockchain-based portal for sharing research articles with organizers of a scientific research publication venue. Additionally, we implement symmetric key encryption of research articles using a data encryption key to ensure the confidentiality and authenticity of intellectual property. A novel contribution of this research work is the design of a secure approach to storing conflict of interests information and, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation of the author's conflict of interests. This solution has been prototyped and analyzed for overall cost-effectiveness and the results show that an organizer incurs an estimated expense of up to $300 for hosting a conference (considering 200 submissions and 2 peer-reviewers assigned to each submission). The authors and reviewers also incur transaction costs estimated at $1.54 and $0.56 for each submission and review, respectively.

The proposed scheme can detect vehicles that send malicious messages and reduce their reputation values for punishing according to the rating mechanism.

Currently, sixth-generation (6G) networks support enhanced holographic projection through terahertz (THz) bandwidths, ultra-low latency, and massive device connectivity. However, the data is exchanged between autonomous networks over untrusted channels. Thus, to ensure data security, privacy, and trust among stakeholders, blockchain (BC) opens new dimensions towards intelligent resource management, user access control, audibility, and chronology in stored transactions. Thus, the BC and 6G coalition in future AR/VR applications is an emerging investigative topic. To date, authors have proposed surveys that study the integration of BC and 6G in AR/VR in isolation, and hence a coherent survey is required. Thus, to address the gap, the survey is the first-of-its-kind to investigate and study the coalition of BC and 6G in AR/VR space.

Among others, one kind of such systems is the popular crowdsensing systems which promise convenient data collection and aggregation. Although promising, leveraging public blockchains to build crowdsensing systems is non-trivial and has to overcome several barriers. First, public blockchains are transparent and lack support for data privacy. Second, participants from the open blockchain environment may misbehave in serving crowdsensing applications, like providing invalid data or doing aggregation incorrectly. Further, on-chain processing incurs monetary cost, so simply putting all workload on-chain is highly uneconomical and a delicate joint on-chain and off-chain design is required. In this paper, we take the first research attempt and explore a new design point to bridge public blockchains with crowdsensing systems. We propose a framework for building private, robust, and verifiable blockchain-empowered crowdsensing systems. It features an open service paradigm where blockchain nodes can rent out their computing resources to serve crowdsensing applications, with custom and full-fledged mechanisms to foster a healthy and economical ecosystem and to simultaneously tackle the challenges of data privacy, robustness against misbehaving participants, and service correctness assurance.

For that reason, we propose a blockchain interoperability oracle that follows a voting-based approach based on threshold signatures. The oracle nodes generate a distributed private key to execute an off-chain aggregation mechanism to collectively respond to requests. Compared to state-of-the-art relay schemes, our approach does not incur any ongoing costs and since the on-chain component only needs to verify a single signature, we can achieve remarkable cost savings compared to conventional oracle solutions.","","978-1-6654-1760-0","10.1109/Blockchain53845.2021.00030","Christian Doppler Research Association; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9680520","blockchain interoperability;blockchain oracles;threshold signature;smart contracts","Resistance;Costs;Conferences;Public key;Blockchains;Relays;Interoperability","cooperative communication;cryptography;data privacy;digital signatures;open systems;private key cryptography;public key cryptography;relay networks (telecommunication)","voting-based blockchain interoperability oracle;blockchain landscape;heterogeneous blockchain platforms;naive relay;voting-based approach;oracle nodes;state-of-the-art relay schemes;conventional oracle solutions","","10","","34","IEEE","24 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, during this period, people must take precautions for safety purposes. One of the essential steps towards eliminating or reducing the effect of COVID-19 is maintaining social distancing while in public places. Some people are neglecting the social distancing norms while on the move. Still, no surveillance system exists, which monitors the people’s movement for social distancing and securely & efficiently shares the information with the concerned administration department. There also exists no penalty system which forces the people to ensure social distancing. Motivated from the aforementioned facts, in this paper, we present a blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI)-envisioned scheme for monitoring social distancing to combat COVID-19 situations. The proposed scheme uses fast region-based convolutional neural networks (RCNN) and you only look once (YOLO) models for the object (i.e., human) detection through the live video feed captured from the static CCTV cameras as well as lens-equipped drones. Further, the efficient euclidean distance calculation is embedded for calculating the distance between two humans. Blockchain technology ensures the secure and trusted exchange of information between the entities at the physical layer and the administration departments. Blockchain wallets are also used to pay the fine when people do not follow social distance norms. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated based on three broad parameters such as (i) human detection and violation identification, (ii) blockchain simulation and analysis, and (iii) network performance comparison. The parameters considered for (i) is confidence score, for (ii) are scalability, hash rate, and simulation interface, and for (iii) are network bandwidth, throughput, packet loss rate, and network latency.

In this paper, we propose a novel NFT-based certificate framework called NFTCert, which enables the establishment of links between a legitimate certificate and its owner through a Blockchain. In this paper, we describe the implementation of the NFTCert framework, including schema definition, minting, verification, and revocation of NFT-based certificates. We also introduce a payment gateway into the minting process, which enables NFTCert to be used by a wider audience. Therefore, participants of NFTCerts do not need to rely on cryptocurrency for transactions. All in all, the proposed framework is designed to achieve usability, authenticity, confidentiality, transparency, and availability properties when it is compared to existing Blockchain-based systems.","","978-1-6654-1760-0","10.1109/Blockchain53845.2021.00081","University of Macau(grant numbers:MYRG2019-00136-FST); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9680582","Blockchain;Smart Contract;NFT;Certificate","Conferences;Companies;Logic gates;Blockchains;Planning;Cryptocurrency;Stakeholders","authorisation;blockchains;certification;cryptocurrencies","NFT-based certificates;online payment gateway;academic certificates;certificate verification;legitimate certificate;minting process;Blockchain-based systems;NFTCert;NFT-based certificate framework;cryptocurrency;nonfungible token","","6","","15","IEEE","24 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a solution that uses blockchain technology as a platform for online neighborhood watch using a form of data cooperative among individuals or organizations in the sharing of data through a peer-to-peer mechanism. We prove the concept by implementing a distributed phishing data sharing system that will maintain a community ledger of reported phishing activities with a consensus-based approval of the phishing transaction and a novel reputation scoring system thereby adding reliability to the system and effectively tackling the phishing problem. The data cooperative provides a way for timely multi-party sharing of phishing data among anti-phishing organizations and users of the internet eliminating the current approach of each organization maintaining its database. Our results show that blockchain is effective in complementing the existing methods of phishing detection and serves as a platform for sharing phishing data with respect to scalability, cost, and memory consumption. Also, our results further show that transaction times on the Ropsten test net follow a Gamma distribution. Our approach can be extrapolated to other data sharing systems like medical data, spam calls, discussion forums, etc.","","978-1-6654-3578-9","10.1109/ICBC51069.2021.9461056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9461056","Cybersecurity;blockchain;phishing;distributed ledger;data cooperative;smart contract;data sharing;peer-to-peer","Gamma distribution;Phishing;Scalability;Memory management;Distributed databases;Organizations;Blockchain","computer crime;Internet;peer-to-peer computing;security of data;unsolicited e-mail;Web sites","Big Data;shared data;online neighborhood watch;peer-to-peer mechanism;distributed phishing data;phishing activities;phishing transaction;reputation scoring system;anti-phishing organizations;phishing detection;medical data;data cooperatives;multiparty sharing;Gamma distribution;Ropsten test net;spam calls;discussion forums","","6","","40","IEEE","24 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

From IPFS we use the IPFS hash to the transaction into the block of the Blockchain. Together with IPFS, IDS and a Customized Authenticator Service (CAS) we propose a model for authentication and integrity management.

However, the existing methodologies and approaches are time-consuming and costly and their major focus is on the SPI of Large Scale Enterprises (LSEs) therefore, we are introducing blockchain in SPI to overcome its major issues such as reliance on a central body of standardization for certification, knowledge management, high cost, resource management and change in organizational culture, etc. We have performed an exploratory case study to identify the different barriers of traditional SPI approaches. To overcome the identified issues, we have proposed and implemented a new approach by performing two case studies. The first case study was performed to identify the barriers in traditional SPI approaches and the second case study was performed to validate our proposed approach. We have performed our experiments on 55 representatives of 50 organizations. According to the results of proposed approach 56.4% of the population agreed that the SPI cost will decrease, 61.8% agreed that time of SPI will decrease and 60.3% of the population agreed that BBSPI will decrease resource utilization. Moreover, 69.1% of the population agreed with the fact that proposed BBSPI will make effective knowledge management and 83.3% of the population said that an organization can mature its processes equaliant to the central certification (CMMI, ISO) body by employing proposed BBSPI. Our results affirm that the BBSPI can reduce the time, cost, resources and helps to manage knowledge used to perform SPI. Moreover, results also depict that the BBSPI can be an efficient substitute of central bodies that could help small and medium-sized organizations to conform to common process improvement models by spending less money, time, and resources with effective knowledge management.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3049904","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9316652","Blockchain;blockchain-based software engineering;software engineering;software process improvement;capability models;software process improvement models;CMMI;ISO;smart contracts;distributed systems","Software;Organizations;Standards organizations;Capability maturity model;Knowledge management;Certification;Blockchain","knowledge management;organisational aspects;small-to-medium enterprises;software process improvement;software quality","BBSPI;knowledge management;process improvement;software development organizations;software projects;resource management;SPI cost;resource utilization;blockchain-based software process improvement;SMEs;large scale enterprises;LSEs","","5","","45","CCBY","8 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Tackling scalability while preserving the security and decentralization of the network is an important challenge. To deliver effective scaling solutions, Ethereum is on the path of a major protocol improvement called Ethereum 2.0 (Eth2), which implements sharding. As the change of consensus mechanism is an extremely delicate matter, this improvement will be achieved through different phases, the first of which is the implementation of the Beacon Chain. For this, a specification has been developed, and multiple groups have implemented clients to run the new protocol. This work analyzes the resource usage behavior of different clients running as Eth2 nodes, comparing their performance and analyzing differences. Our results show multiple important network perturbations and how different clients react to them. We discuss the differences between Eth2 clients and their limitations.","","978-1-6654-3924-4","10.1109/BRAINS52497.2021.9569812","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9569812","Blokchain;Ethereum2;Eth2;Beacon Chain;Sharding;Clients;Proof of Stake;Smart Contracts;Scaling","Protocols;Perturbation methods;Scalability;Detectors;Solids;Software;Real-time systems","blockchains;protocols;resource allocation","network security;scaling solutions;protocol improvement;consensus mechanism;Beacon Chain;resource usage behavior;Eth2 nodes;network perturbations;Eth2 clients;resource analysis;Ethereum 2.0 clients;permissionless blockchains;scalability;network decentralization","","4","","22","IEEE","25 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since then, people have increased distrust of the resume, the certificates, and the testing reports of the food, as well as the government's functionality of supervising food safety. Therefore, constructing a reliable food traceability system under the distrust becomes the main purpose of this paper, and the characteristics of blockchain technology are happen to be able to eliminate the dependence on the trust of these centralized third-party. In this thesis, we target on two aspects of food traceability: the environment in which the ingredients of the food are sourced, and the logistics and shipping environment through which the food supply chain passes. The source environment of the ingredients part is based on the accurate environmental data collected by the IoT sensors deployed at the farm, as well as the various certificates or testing report of the farms. As for the logistics shipping environment, is also based on the data collected by the IoT sensor deployed in the vehicle. Supported by blockchain technology, with its characteristics, it provides verification for these data under the distrust of both parties. At last, our system supports e-commerce service.

In order to solve it, we propose a practical ranked choice online voting system where every user can verify the validity of the outcomes. The proposed system combines the use of public blockchain and Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to ensure that all standard requirements for voting systems are met, and at the same time to provide protection against malicious adversaries with administrative access. Each cast vote is submitted to the Intel SGX via a secure communication channel. The SGX verifies the eligibility and validity of the vote and encrypts it inside the SGX enclave. Later on, only the fingerprints (i.e., the hash values) of the encrypted votes are published on the public blockchain ledger before the deadline of the election. All encrypted votes are released after the deadline. Every voter can self-tally all submissions in encrypted form using the homomorphic property of our encryption system. The proposed protocol also achieves end-to-end voter verification. Our theoretical security analysis and experimental results show that the protocol is secure and is more efficient than previous alternative voting protocols.","2324-9013","978-1-6654-1658-0","10.1109/TrustCom53373.2021.00036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9724459","e-voting;end-to-end voter verification;public blockchain;self-tallying;smart contract","Privacy;Protocols;Side-channel attacks;Fingerprint recognition;Software;Blockchains;Encryption","cryptographic protocols;government data processing;software architecture;telecommunication security;trusted computing","secure communication channel;SGX enclave;encrypted votes;public blockchain ledger;encryption system;theoretical security analysis;previous alternative voting protocols;secure ranked choice online voting system;Intel SGX;election outcome;practical ranked choice online;Intel Software Guard Extensions;cast vote","","3","","22","IEEE","9 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, maintaining BBAC can be potentially expensive due to the storage cost of the blockchain. To address this issue, we propose a layered BBAC architecture by combining blockchain with blockchain oracle and tamper-proof decentralized storage (e.g., IOTA). The proposed architecture consists of three main layers: a blockchain layer, which provides distributed and trustworthy access control, a storage layer, which stores meta data (e.g., subject/object attributes and policies) used in the access control of the blockchain layer, and an oracle layer, which works as a bridge to help transfer data between the blockchain and decentralized storage. This architecture achieves robust, auditable, and cost-efficient access control by migrating the meta data from the blockchain to the decentralized storage while keeping the fascinating tamper-proof feature of the blockchain. We implement and evaluate this architecture in terms of time and monetary cost to demonstrate its feasibility and superiority over existing ones.","","978-1-7281-8104-2","10.1109/GLOBECOM46510.2021.9685205","JSPS KAKENHI(grant numbers:19K14983); JSPS KAKENHI (A)(grant numbers:19H01103); Center for Advanced Telecommunications Technology Research Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9685205","IoT;blockchain;attribute-based access control;smart contract;blockchain oracle;decentralized storage","Access control;Bridges;Costs;Conferences;Metadata;Blockchains;Internet of Things","authorisation;blockchains;Internet of Things;meta data","cost-efficient blockchain-based access control;unauthorized resource access;storage cost;layered BBAC architecture;blockchain oracle;tamper-proof decentralized storage;main layers;blockchain layer;trustworthy access control;storage layer;oracle layer;cost-efficient access control;Internet of Things;IoT","","3","","21","IEEE","2 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A resource management service with a global view is needed to monitor and make decisions to orchestrate these resources and provision them to the applications at run-time even in the presence of faults or varying demand and availability of the resources to ensure: (i) the real-time applications produce the desired output under stringent timing constraints, and (ii) the safety-critical applications behave as per their safety assurance levels. Previous approaches for such systems present techniques to monitor and orchestrate resources with centralized global resource orchestration decision-making.

The effective and secure management of the same is an integral task. With new and upcoming technologies, there have been various new mechanisms to securely store patient information. It is a time critical task to retrieve and refer to a patient’s medical record for effective and rapid treatment. Due to the large number of Electronic Medical Records(EMR) owing to the large healthcare sector, there exists high risk of possible intrusions. It is also one of the most targeted sectors for personal data theft. This paper proposes a secure system for storage and access of these Electronic Medical Records(EMR) taking into consideration the confidentiality, integrity and availability of these records. The paper proposes a system for access of a centralised storage system for healthcare institutions around the globe, taking into account the secure features of a decentralised Interplanetary File System(IPFS). The storage system utilises the Blockchain Ecosystem for storing sensitive data. This system also implements a Role Based Access Control(RBAC) system for access to the storage.

Supply chain stakeholders conventionally transport their goods, along with the corresponding documentation via regulators for compliance checks. This is generally followed by a tedious and manual process to ensure the goods meet regulatory requirements. However, supply chain systems are changing through digitization. In digitized supply chains, data is shared with the relevant stakeholders through digital supply chain platforms, including blockchain technology. In such datadriven digital supply chains, the regulators may be able to leverage digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, to automate the compliance verification process. However, a barrier to progress is the risk that information will not be credible, thus reversing the gains that automation could achieve. Automating compliance based on inaccurate data may compromise the safety and credibility of the agricultural supply chain, which discourages regulators and other stakeholders from adopting and relying on automation. Within this article we consider the challenges of digital supply chains when we describe parts of the compliance management process and how it can be automated to improve the operational efficiency of agricultural supply chains. We introduce assisted autonomy as a means to pragmatically automate the compliance verification process by combining the power of digital systems while keeping the human in-the-loop. We argue that autonomous compliance is possible, but that the need for human led inspection processes will never be replaced by machines, however it can be minimised through “assisted autonomy”.","","978-1-6654-1623-8","10.1109/TPSISA52974.2021.00035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9750225","Supply Chain;Compliance Management;Automation;Regulation;Blockchain;Smart Contracts","Regulators;Automation;Supply chains;Transportation;Manuals;Machine learning;Regulation","agriculture;blockchains;goods distribution;learning (artificial intelligence);production engineering computing;supply chain management;supply chains;transportation","assisted autonomy;compliance verification process;digital systems;supply chain compliance management;agricultural supply chain;supply chain stakeholders;digitized supply chains;digital supply chain platforms;datadriven digital supply chains;digital technologies;compliance management process;compliance automation;business operations;goods transport;regulatory requirements;blockchain technology;artificial intelligence;machine learning;human in-the-loop","","1","","22","IEEE","14 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Lack of information on food produce such as origin, quality, shelf time etc. for the consumers has resulted in distrust among them which can also affect the producers in terms of marketing and pricing. All this stems from the current food procurement and distribution systems that are centrally controlled and dependence on regulatory bodies for quality control. This has led to opacity about information about the food produce and also doubts on such available data if any among the stakeholders. The need of the hour is a system that can provide information in a transparent manner to its stakeholders especially its customers. This information made reliably available will build trust among the consumers and thereby improves brand value for sellers.Blockchain is a disruptive technology that has been exploited across several domains, the Food Procurement and Distribution system is no exception to it. Block chain allows for generating trust among the stakeholders because of its properties like immutability and transparency that any one part of the system can verify the authenticity of information stored in it. If all transactions happening in the Food Procurement and Distribution system from point of production to the point of consumption are recorded on the Block chain. Then it becomes easier for customers to verify whether the claims from the seller about the food quality are indeed true. This paper outlines a survey on the current work and research in the field of food supply chain management using Block chain technology and also specify the future research trends in the same area.","","978-1-6654-0360-3","10.1109/ICCMC51019.2021.9418305","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9418305","Blockchain;Food Supply Chain Management;Smart Contract;Immutability","Procurement;Supply chains;Memory;Blockchain;Quality control;Pricing;Organizations","blockchains;food products;production engineering computing;quality control;supply chain management","food quality;food supply chain management;block chain technology;blockchain based solutions;food produce;current food procurement;distribution systems;quality control;stakeholders","","","","21","IEEE","6 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In cases of chronic diseases, like cancer or diabtetes, it becomes necessary to seek different providers for different procedures. Practitioners need access to complete medical history of a patient. Despite the advantages of Electronic Health Records(EHR), sharing is normally done through mail or fax, as feasible, suitable applications for EHR storage that operate with high levels of security are only on the edge of the market.Ecosystems for Health Information Exchange(HIE) have the usual goal of ensuring safe, secure access, as well as diagnostic aids, and a range of usabilty across the practitioners of an entire nation. Centralised EHR systems do not have protection from failure events, as well as the expected security and privacy concerns that severely restrict their scalability.Blockchain makes use of a distributed ledger that provides a complete history of every transaction that has occured in the network. This generation of transactional applications have generated immense hype because of rapid improvements to transparency, while not sacrificing high levels of scalability. Blockchains have provided a high level of success in distributing a shared history to massive numbers of users, while maintaining the data’s integrity. This scalable, decentralised approach has immense benefits for EHR, allowing interaction of medical specialists on a level not seen before. In this paper, we will propose a blockchain network that uses a Proof-Of-Points consensus algorithm which will allow users to produce blocks efficiently and transparently. The proposed application will ensure security through a multi-level authentication method, as well as a fast querying and fast storage guarantees, that will make it more attractive for medical practitioners.","","978-1-6654-3986-2","10.1109/ICSCAN53069.2021.9526516","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9526516","Proof-Of-Points;consensus algorithm;multilevel authentication;smart contracts","Privacy;Hospitals;Scalability;Consensus algorithm;Maintenance engineering;Security;History","blockchains;data privacy;diseases;electronic health records;health care;medical computing","blockchain network;multilevel authentication method;medical practitioners;healthcare specialization;chronic diseases;medical history;EHR storage;secure access;diagnostic aids;centralised EHR systems;privacy concerns;distributed ledger;transactional applications;shared history;medical specialists;proof-of-points consensus algorithm;electronic health records","","","","20","IEEE","6 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this scenario, the security and effectiveness of blockchain can not be guaranteed as vehicles are offline.11Offline refers to that the vehicles can not connect to the Internet, but they can use vehicle-to-vehicle communication to share data. and can not update the blockchain on time. On addressing the issue, We develop an offline blockchain scheme that is composed of offline and online phases. In the offline phase, vehicles transact by sending a commitment. In the online phases before and after the offline phase, the deposit and arbitration mechanisms are proposed to defeat potential attacks in the offline phase. Lastly, the consortium blockchain is deployed to store the records of the cooperative perception process so that the records are tamper-proof and can be traced. Using extensive evaluations, we show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","2577-2465","978-1-6654-1368-8","10.1109/VTC2021-Fall52928.2021.9625169","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9625169","Internet of Vehicles;offline cooperative perception;blockchain;smart contract","Vehicular and wireless technologies;Toxicology;Roads;Forensics;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Blockchains;Sensors","computer network security;cooperative communication;cryptographic protocols;Internet;telecommunication network reliability;vehicular ad hoc networks;wireless sensor networks","perception range;accurate sensing information;false information;perception process;blockchain-based scheme;offline blockchain scheme;online phases;offline phase;vehicles transact;consortium blockchain","","","","8","IEEE","10 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Medical records are personal data that can only be accessed by authorized personnel. Some problems occur, such as the difficulty in managing files for grouping patients’ medical record data based on specific categories such as the documentation year or patients’ biodata. A large storage area is needed to hold medical record data and the absence of backup data in data storage. Blockchain-based solutions help overcome this problem. Hyperledger Composer is an open and extensive development framework for blockchain systems. Hyperledger Composer allows us to quickly model business networks and integrate them into an application or system that we have created easy and save time. Hyperledger consists of 3 main files, model file, script file, and access control file, which have coding flexibility and are easier to understand. Hyperledger Composer uses the JavaScript language for coding and has a client library for node.js. In this study, we propose a medical record sharing model that combines blockchain with the Hyperledger Composer and conducts a performance evaluation of the implementation. The result shows the increase of transactions during testing in which the system could store data into blocks to record medical transactions.","","978-1-6654-1001-4","10.1109/NICS54270.2021.9701546","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9701546","Electronic Health Record (EHR);blockchain;bitcoin;smart contract;hyperledger composer.","Industries;Drugs;Distributed ledger;Memory;Documentation;Medical services;Encoding","authorisation;data privacy;health care;Java;medical information systems","3 main files;model file;script file;access control file;Hyperledger Composer;medical record sharing model;medical transactions;blockchain-enabled electronic medical record;medical records;personal data;grouping patients;medical record data;backup data;data storage;blockchain-based solutions;blockchain systems","","","","19","IEEE","8 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Blockchain is a distributed ledger where blocks of transactions are connected in a chain using the cryptographic hash function of the previous block, making it an append-only structure. Any modification on any of the blocks will generate different hash values in other blocks in a cascading manner and different link relations. In this way the blockchain achieves immutability and security. Blockchain also involves consensus mechanisms in order to ensure synchronization among blocks and agreement between existing nodes to add a new transaction in the chain. Healthcare data is highly sensitive in nature, which consists of private information related to the diagnosis and treatment of patients. In traditional approach these data are stored by each hospital separately where sharing data is very time consuming. Also, health data is very limited to access due to the risk of disclosure of sensitive information. In order to address these issues, the objective of this paper is to integrate blockchain technology with healthcare records/data in order to provide better sharing of data without the fear of data tampering or security breach.","","978-1-7281-8595-8","10.1109/ICCCNT51525.2021.9579571","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9579571","Blockchain;EMR;Smart Contract;Patient;Encryption;Hyperledger","Hospitals;Distributed ledger;Cryptographic hash function;Blockchains;Security;Synchronization;Reliability","blockchains;data privacy;electronic health records;health care;hospitals;multi-agent systems;patient diagnosis;patient treatment","blockchain technology;distributed ledger;cryptographic hash function;healthcare data;data sharing;data security breach;electronic health record system security;transaction blocks;consensus mechanisms;synchronization;private patient information;patient diagnosis;patient treatment;hospital;data tampering","","","","16","IEEE","3 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Industrial alliances and companies are running anti-piracy incentive campaigns, but their effectiveness is publicly questioned due to the lack of transparency. We believe that full transparency of a campaign is necessary to truly incentivize people. It means that every role, e.g., content owner, licensee of the content, or every person in the open population, can understand the mechanism and be assured about its execution without trusting any single role. We see this as a distributed system problem. In this paper, we present Argus, a fully transparent incentive system for anti-piracy campaigns. The groundwork of Argus is to formulate the objectives for fully transparent incentive mechanisms, which securely and comprehensively consolidate the different interests of all roles. These objectives form the core of the Argus design, highlighted by our innovations about a Sybil-proof incentive function, a commit-and-reveal scheme, and an oblivious transfer scheme. In the implementation, we overcome a set of unavoidable obstacles to ensure security despite full transparency. Moreover, we effectively optimize several cryptographic operations so that the cost for a piracy reporting is reduced to an equivalent cost of sending about 14 ETH-transfer transactions to run on the public Ethereum network, which would otherwise correspond to thousands of transactions. With the security and practicality of Argus, we hope real-world anti-piracy campaigns will be truly effective by shifting to a fully transparent incentive mechanism.","2575-8462","978-1-6654-3819-3","10.1109/SRDS53918.2021.00023","NSFC(grant numbers:61972155); Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality(grant numbers:20DZ1100300); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9603461","Anti-piracy;Smart contract;Digital watermarking;Cryptography;Incentive mechanism","Technological innovation;Costs;Systematics;Surface resistance;Sociology;Companies;Reliability","computer crime;cryptography;data privacy;incentive schemes","open anonymous population;anti-piracy incentive campaigns;transparency;open population;distributed system problem;Argus design;Sybil-proof incentive function;piracy reporting;real-world anti-piracy campaigns;transparent incentive system;ETH-transfer transactions;public Ethereum network;cryptographic operations","","","","39","IEEE","22 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, these power inverters are assumed to be connected at the same point of common coupling directly or via radial feeders; thus, the voltage references are the same for each parallel power inverter, thus requiring a virtual impedance loop. In addition, classic power sharing techniques comply with their individual power rates, and circulating currents among distributed generators are not considered. Under these circumstances, energy trading among prosumers and peer-to-peer contracts is not feasible in autonomous AC micro- and nanogrid operations. This paper proposes a reformulated power flow problem, adapted to autonomous droop-controlled AC microgrids, to be used as a secondary control layer. The entire hierarchical control is implemented and experimentally validated in a laboratory-scale nanogrid with energy storage systems, photovoltaic generators and power converters.

First, a data offloading scheme is proposed where mobile devices can offload health data to a nearby MEC server for efficient computation with privacy awareness. Moreover, we design a data-sharing scheme, which enables data exchanges among healthcare users by leveraging blockchain and interplanetary file system. Particularly, a smart contract-based authentication mechanism is integrated with MEC to perform decentralized user access verification at the network edge without requiring any central authority.

To guarantee the security requirements of SGIN, anonymous authentication is an essential approach to addressing severe threats such as unauthorized access and impersonation attack, while payment is another common method in service-oriented applications in order to encourage companies to participate and also prevent insider attackers from enjoying services without paying. Existing anonymous authentication protocols for SGIN either require users to involve in heavy computation especially in dynamic scenarios, or do not consider cross-domain authentication. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of cross-company satellite services, and then address the cross-domain authentication and billing issues in SGIN, i.e., we propose a decentralized anonymous authentication scheme supporting fast handover and also achieve fairness for the billing procedures. To reduce the authentication delays, the authentication process is delegated from ground to satellites, such that users can arbitrarily switch the satellite networks belonging to different companies. Specifically, users can be anonymously authenticated by showing the knowledge of a secret bound with a randomized verifiable credential and connect to different satellite networks through a fast handover authentication protocol building on a blockchain.

These cameras garner a lot of visual information that is often processed and stored in remote and centralized cloud servers. Multiple occasions have revealed that this traditional approach is plagued with security and privacy breaches. The breaches could be the interception of raw videos while in transit to distant surveillance analytics centers (SAC), infiltration to cameras and network video records (NVR), or abuse of cameras and stored videos. Hence, the traditional video surveillance system (VSS) cannot guarantee the protection of the privacy of individuals caught on CCTV cameras. Therefore, this paper proposes a Secure and Privacy-preserving Stored surveillance video sharing (SePriS) mechanism for authorized users/nodes based on blockchain (BC), smart contracts, and the enciphering of video frames using DAB, a mechanism developed based on discrete cosine transform (DCT), advanced encryption standard (AES), and a block shuffling (BS) algorithm. The BC-based solution creates an environment auspicious for creating decentralized, reliable SACs and storage sites with secure and privacy-aware sharing of stored surveillance videos across SAC nodes and by law enforcers, police departments, and courts securely connected to the SAC nodes. The experiments and analyses validate that the proposed BC-based SePriS solution achieves the design purpose.","2637-9430","978-1-6654-1278-0","10.1109/ICCCN52240.2021.9522199","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9522199","Permissioned Blockchain;Video Privacy & Security;Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT);AES;Enciphering","Visualization;TV;Transforms;Cameras;Video surveillance;Blockchains;Discrete cosine transforms","blockchains;closed circuit television;cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;discrete cosine transforms;video recording;video surveillance","privacy-aware sharing;BC-based SePriS solution;permissioned blockchain;closed-circuit television cameras;remote cloud servers;centralized cloud servers;security breaches;privacy breaches;CCTV cameras;smart contracts;video frames;BC-based solution;privacy-preserving stored surveillance video sharing;surveillance analytics centers;advanced encryption standard;discrete cosine transform;block shuffling algorithm;network video records","","3","","31","IEEE","31 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) emerge as a prospective primitive to provide IoT nodes with lightweight physical identities for authentication. However, when integrating PUFs into multiserver authentication protocols to improve security, the following problems occur: 1) the challenge–response pairs (CRPs) of PUFs generated by devices need to be explicitly stored by each edge server. This will cause the privacy leakage of CRPs; 2) the reliability is reduced resulting from the single point failure; and 3) existing PUFs-based authentication protocols would need to put great efforts into synchronizing CRPs, to ensure consistency in multiserver systems. To overcome these problems, in this article, we propose a privacy-aware authentication protocol for the multiserver CE-IoT systems by combining PUFs and the blockchain technique. The real correlations of CRPs are double encoded into mapping correlations (MCs) by a one-time physical identity and the keyed-hash function. The blockchain is leveraged to store MCs, synchronize them efficiently, and incorporate the multireceiver encryption to share the physical identity securely. The security of our protocol is formally proved by a random oracle model, and security features are discussed to show that our protocol resists various attacks. Moreover, a prototype was implemented to prove the efficiency of the protocol, and the comparison results present that our protocol accommodates CE-IoT systems. Finally, the simulation of the smart contract evaluates the scalability of our protocol.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3068410","Shenzhen Science Technology and Innovation Commission (SZSTI)(grant numbers:JCYJ20170817115500476); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9385400","Blockchain;Internet of Things (IoT);multiserver authentication;physical unclonable functions (PUFs);privacy;security","Protocols;Authentication;Security;Servers;Blockchain;Smart devices;Physical unclonable function","blockchains;cloud computing;cryptographic protocols;data privacy;Internet of Things;message authentication;telecommunication security","cloud-edge IoT systems;Things;IoT nodes;physical unclonable functions;lightweight physical identities;multiserver authentication protocols;challenge-response pairs;edge server;synchronizing CRPs;multiserver systems;privacy-aware authentication protocol;multiserver CE-IoT systems;blockchain technique;one-time physical identity;protocol resists various attacks;integrating PUF;privacy-aware PUF-based multiserver authentication protocol","","25","","60","IEEE","24 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Every moment, the hands are used to greet people and handle objects, but shortly thereafter, it is common to use them to touch the face. Such an involuntary action can take all kinds of harmful agents into our bodies. Hence, this work aims to present and share the development of a low cost bracelet that helps the user not to touch the face with the hands. As a result, it is expected to reduce the spread of this virus through this type of contagion. For this, the bracelet monitors the position of the hands and issues an alert when it detects the approach of the hand to the face as a warning to the user not do this. Initially, a first prototype was made to observe local public (state of Alagoas-Brazil) interest in the product. This way, there were a positive feedback from public. The sequence of the project was extended in the development of the product such a way that it can be used by the final public in risky regions. Due to its low cost, this bracelet can be used by people from underdeveloped countries like Brazil, and countries in Africa to stop practicing this harmful habit for their health.

The proposed platform is designed based on the characteristic of the IoT system that the real-world data is continuously generated from the origin IoT device and there may exist various sensing devices (e.g., smartphone, sensor node) in the vicinity of the origin device. In the integrity verification mechanism, the origin device requests the surrounding devices to cooperate to verify the integrity of the real-world data. The tendency of the real-world data of the origin device should be almost the same as the data generated by the cooperator devices if the data tampering/spoofing did not occur.

Thus loan grants to PB from PL is secured, authorized, and automated so as to expedite the disbursement process. KiRTi stores PB historical transactions, current assets, and liabilities as time-series sequenced data in a public blockchain. The sequenced data is fetched from blockchain by a long-short term memory (LSTM) model that generates CS for loan recommendations based on proposed lending algorithms for PB and PL. To ensure real-time updation of CS, edge-weights are updated based on boolean indicators from PB and PL, which indicates the successful repayments and loan-defaults. The process is iterated to improve the accuracy of edge-weights and generated CS to ensures the correct credibility of PB for future lending. Smart contracts (SC) are proposed for automatic setup of loan repayments between PB and PL. To model the LSTM recommender scheme, a German credit dataset from UCI repository is considered with 1000 credit-histories of PB, with 700 successful repayments and 300 defaults. KiRTi achieves an accuracy of 97.5% in comparison to conventional approaches with an F-measure of 0.98304.

The interaction strength is manipulated by varying the number of rotating rotors and the normalized rotor separation distance. A stronger rotor-rotor interaction places the inner tip vortices between rotors closer to each other, forming an upflow region through vortex pairing and intensifying the turbulence intensity between rotors. To comprehensively evaluate the effect of interaction on the wake structure, we propose a modified Landgrebe's model that accurately describes the wake boundary of UAV, given the number of rotating rotors and the normalized rotor separation distance. The wake analysis based on the model shows that the stronger the rotor-rotor interaction, the less the wake contracts and the closer the vena contracta moves to the rotor-tip path plane. The momentum theory combined with the modified Landgrebe's model shows that the loss of axial momentum transfer due to the wake inclination is insufficient to account for the thrust loss caused by the rotor-rotor interaction. This paper shows that the shift of the inner tip vortex away from the rotational axis and the corresponding increase of induced axial velocity followed by a decrease in the local effective angle of attack is another important mechanism for the thrust loss.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3088150","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) by the Ministry of Education(grant numbers:NRF-2019R1F1A106406612); Civil-Military Technology Cooperation Program(grant numbers:18-CM-AS-22); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9452140","Rotor-rotor interaction;thrust;unmanned aerial vehicles;wake","Rotors;Blades;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Velocity measurement;Numerical models;Loss measurement;Geometry","aerodynamics;autonomous aerial vehicles;helicopters;rotors;turbulence;vortices;wakes","wake structure;quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle;rotor tip Reynolds number range;rotating rotors;normalized rotor separation distance;stronger rotor-rotor interaction;rotors closer;rotor-tip path plane","","5","","63","CCBY","11 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

That implies those applications involving sensitive data or personal information, which require security and privacy protection, are not suitable to be implemented in Blockchain, directly. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes have been treated as one of the end-to-end solutions to data security and privacy protection problems. In this article, we examine the possibility (or cost) of embedding the ideal lattice-based FHE into the Ethereum Blockchain for building up a new trustworthy framework with security and privacy protection capability. Due to the limitations of current Blockchain, the execution of FHE is conducted off-chain; at the same time, on-chain members can call FHE-based functions to directly compute the ciphertext domain operations after their Smart Contracts have been deployed to the Blockchain. To illustrate and benchmark the examining results of our framework, an FHE and Blockchain-based Vickrey auction system is also developed, in which the online bidding prices are kept in secret.

In this paper, to alleviate such imbalance of energy generation between distributed users, a peer to peer (P2P) based energy trading platform is proposed. Specifically, blockchain is one of emerging solutions in which transactions can be made reliably to achieve P2P transactions without any centralized broker intervention. Correspondingly, we implement the P2P energy trading platform under Ethereum's smart contract for reliable trading. The energy generated from distributed users at the proposed platform can be traded by utilizing the characteristics of Decentralize Application. Specifically, we provide the details of implementations of the proposed platform, which includes both hardware platform and software platform.

Apart from the HES size and location planning, its optimal investment phase is also determined by maximizing the system equivalent daily profit (EDP) and minimizing the risk. To handle the system uncertainties from renewable energy sources, power demands, outdoor temperature, and residential hot water needs, the multistage adaptive stochastic optimization approach is utilized. Then, through the constraint linearization and stochastic scenario sampling, the original nonlinear deployment model is converted to a mixed-integer linear programming one and tested on an IEEE 33-bus distribution network based RMEMG. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by comparing it with the existing practices. The comparison results indicate that the proposed risk-averse deployment method can effectively increase the system EDP and more immune to the uncertainties.

However, the ubiquitous keyword search function over encrypted files is yet to be supported. To enable this function, we first apply searchable encryption techniques to the decentralized setting. But this primitive can hardly ensure the service integrity. The reason is that decentralized storage commonly faces severe threats from both clients and service peers. Service peers may return partial or incorrect results, while clients may intentionally slander the service peers to avoid payments. To address these threats, we utilize the smart contract to record the logs of encrypted search (aka evidence) on the blockchain, and devise a fair protocol to handle disputes and issue fair payments. Using a dynamic-efficient searchable encryption scheme as an instantiation, we craft a concrete scheme that preserves encrypted search capability and enforces ecosystem healthiness, so that service peers are incentivized to make real efforts and jointly guarantee service reliability.

However, the privacy of vehicles and the security of event information is a major concern. The problem of secure sharing of event information without compromising the trusted third party (TTP) and data storage is the main issue in ITS. Blockchain technologies can resolve this problem. A work has been published on blockchain-based protocol for secure sharing of events and authentication of vehicles. This protocol addresses the issue of the safe storing of event information. However, authentication of vehicles solely depends on the cloud server. As a result, their scheme utilizes the notion of partially decentralized architecture. This paper proposes a novel decentralized architecture for the vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) without the cloud server. This work also presents a protocol for securing event information and vehicle authentication using the blockchain mechanism. In this protocol, the registered user accesses the event information securely from the interplanetary file system (IPFS). We incorporate the IPFS, along with blockchain, to store the information in a fully distributed manner. The proposed protocol is compared with the state-of-the-art. The comparison provides desirable security at a reasonable cost. The evaluation of the proposed smart contract in terms of cost (GAS) is also discussed.","2329-9274","","10.1109/JAS.2021.1004225","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9530615","Authentication;blockchain;interplanetary file system (IPFS);secure information sharing;security","Protocols;Costs;File systems;Authentication;Vehicular ad hoc networks;Blockchains;Servers","cloud computing;cryptographic protocols;data privacy;telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","nterplanetary file system;TTP;trusted third party;vehicle authentication;blockchain-based protocol;data storage;authentication protocol;blockchain-based secured IPFS-enable event storage technique;event information","","31","","21","","7 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the integration of blockchain in such networks, information of all granularity levels, from complete blocks to individual transactions, would be accessible to vehicles at any time. Specifically, the blockchain technology is expected to improve the security, immutability, and decentralization of cellular V2X communication through smart contract and distributed ledgers. Although blockchain-based cellular V2X networks hold promise, many challenges need to be addressed to enable the future interoperability and accessibility of such large-scale platforms. One such challenge is the offloading of mining tasks in cellular V2X networks. While transportation authorities may try to balance the network mining load, the vehicles may select the nearest mining clusters to offload a task. This may cause congestion and disproportionate use of vehicular network resources. To address this issue, we propose a game-theoretic approach for balancing the load at mining clusters while maintaining fairness among offloading vehicles. Keeping in mind the low-latency requirements of vehicles, we consider a finite channel blocklength transmission which is more practical compared to the use of infinite blocklength codes. The simulation results obtained with our proposed offloading framework show improved performance over the conventional nearest mining cluster selection technique.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2020.3006176","Business Finland under the Project 5G Finnish Open Research Collaboration Ecosystem (5G-FORCE); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9142451","Blockchain;cellular V2X communications;latency;mining;vehicular","Task analysis;Data mining;Bandwidth;Autonomous vehicles","channel capacity;cloud computing;data mining;data privacy;electronic money;financial data processing;game theory;mobile computing;open systems;peer-to-peer computing","vehicular network resources;offloading vehicles;offloading framework show improved performance;conventional nearest mining cluster selection technique;efficient mining cluster selection;Blockchain-Based Cellular V2X Communications;Cellular vehicle-to-everything communication;autonomous vehicles;granularity levels;complete blocks;individual transactions;blockchain technology;cellular V2X communication;future interoperability;mining tasks;network mining load;nearest mining clusters","","22","","40","IEEE","16 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since many such mobile applications are computation-intensive, mobile edge computing (MEC), a promising computing paradigm that can provide on-demand computation resources (i.e., virtual machines (VMs)), is considered to adopt for allowing MUs to offload their computation tasks to EgSvrs in the proximity. Previous works have developed many schemes to schedule computation tasks to be offloaded to edge servers (EgSvrs). However, these developed schemes are centralized, which are vulnerable to congested coordination operations, and have no trustworthiness guarantee as well. In this paper, we propose to design a decentralized coordination scheme to orchestrate MUs and EgSvrs for scheduling computation tasks to their right VMs by taking advantage of blockchain technology. Specifically, we develop an efficient task-VM matching algorithm that jointly considers task execution time and energy consumption. Particularly, we prove the stability of the task-VM matching achieved by the developed matching algorithm. Besides, we further implement the developed task-VM matching algorithm on the blockchain by developing a smart matching contract to perform task-VM matching on the blockchain without trusted third parties.

First, traditional systems fail to protect the privacy of task requesters and workers. They typically rely on a centralized server to aggregate the task content and workers' interests, while these data contain sensitive information. Second, crowdsourcing resources in each system are isolated. The tasks in one system cannot reach potential workers in other systems. Thus, there is a great need to build a new privacy-preserving and federated crowdsourcing system. However, the existing privacy-preserving solutions rely on a trusted third party to perform key management, which is not applicable in a federated setting. To this end, we propose the first proxy-free privacy-preserving and federated crowdsourcing system. It interconnects the existing crowdsourcing systems and can perform encrypted task matching across various systems without relying on a trusted third-party authority. Our main idea is to achieve federated crowdsourcing by moving secure task matching to the trusted smart contract. To get rid of the dependence on the trusted authority, we combine the rewritable deterministic hashing technique with searchable encryption schemes to achieve secure on-chain task-matching authorization. Moreover, we utilize the puncturable encryption technique to implement secure authorization revocation. We formally analyze the security of our design and implement a prototype on Ethereum. Evaluation results demonstrate that our design is secure and efficient for blockchain-based crowdsourcing.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3051295","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Shenzhen Basic Research Program(grant numbers:JCYJ20190806143011274); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772154,61572412); Research Grants Council of Hong Kong(grant numbers:CityU 11208917,CityU 11212717,CityU 11217819,CityU 11217620,CityU C1008-16G); Innovation and Technology Commission of Hong Kong through ITF Project(grant numbers:ITS/145/19); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9321457","Blockchain;federated crowdsourcing;puncturable encryption;rewritable deterministic hashing (RDH);searchable encryption (SE)","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Blockchain;Cryptography;Encryption;Authorization;Privacy","blockchains;crowdsourcing;data privacy;private key cryptography;trusted computing","privacy-preserving solutions;federated setting;federated crowdsourcing system;secure task;blockchain-based crowdsourcing;crowdsourcing systems;secure authorization revocation;secure on-chain task-matching authorization;searchable encryption schemes;proxy-free privacy-preserving system;blockchain;rewritable deterministic hashing technique","","10","","44","IEEE","13 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This fact makes apparent the necessity of modernizing the road infrastructure, the signalling elements and the traffic management systems. Many initiatives have emerged around the term Intelligent Transport System (ITS) in order to define new scenarios and requirements for this kind of applications. We even have two main competing technologies for implementing Vehicular communication protocols (V2X), C-V2X and 802.11p, but neither of them is widely deployed yet. One of the main barriers for the massive adoption of those technologies is governance. Current solutions rely on the use of a public key infrastructure that enables secure collaboration between the different entities in the V2X ecosystem, but given its global scope, managing such infrastructure requires reaching agreements between many parties, with conflicts of interest between automakers and telecommunication operators. As a result, there are plenty of use cases available and two mature communication technologies, but the complexity at the business layer is stopping the drivers from taking advantage of ITS applications. Blockchain technologies are defining a new decentralized paradigm for most traditional applications, where smart contracts provide a straightforward mechanism for decentralized governance. In this work, we propose an approach for decentralized V2X (D-V2X) that does not require any trusted authority and can be implemented on top of any communication protocol.

In our search for synergies between human-agent-robot teamwork (HART) and the complementary strengths of the DAO, AI, and robots, we decentralize the Tactile Internet by leveraging mobile end-user equipment via partially or fully decentralized multi-access edge computing, and crowdsourcing of human expertise to decrease the completion time of physical tasks in the event of unreliable feedback forecasting of teleoperated robots. Finally, we aim at enhancing the human capabilities of unskilled crowd members by using our proposed nudge contract.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.021.1900667","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9520371","","","artificial intelligence;blockchains;Internet of Things;mobile computing;multi-access systems;multi-agent systems;software agents;telerobotics","unreliable feedback forecasting;fully decentralized multiaccess edge computing;partially decentralized multiaccess edge computing;HART;Internet of Things;human capabilities;teleoperated robots;human expertise;mobile end-user equipment;human-agent-robot teamwork;autonomous AI based software agents;DAO;decentralized autonomous organization;human-to-machine interaction;tactile Internet;artificial intelligence;smart contracts;smart cities;BIoT;blockchain-based IoT applications;blockchain technologies","","7","","15","IEEE","20 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

There is a growing trend of adopting blockchain technologies to the IIoT due to the traceability, nonrepudiation, and immutability of blockchain systems. The proliferation of IIoT to industrial systems is fostering the fourth industrial revolution (aka Industry 4.0) while IIoT also confronts several challenges exhibiting in the following two perspectives: 1) security and privacy protection of IIoT data; 2) interoperability absence across IIoT systems. Blockchain and blockchain-enabled smart contracts can essentially offer solutions to address the emerging challenges in IIoT.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2021.3080427","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9502426","","Special issues and sections;Industrial Internet of Things;Data privacy;Smart grids;Scalability;Fourth Industrial Revolution;Blockchains","","","","","","0","IEEE","30 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A complete record of the panel discussion was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Smart cities can be described as a smart system comprising numerous integrated smart systems that fuse and share data, including personal and potentially sensitive private information. Such circumstances could intrude on the rights to privacy, and human dignity, with disclosures potentially harmful to the individual, families, friends, associates, and communities. This workshop will examine ways to promote the best outcomes for the residents and visitors of smart cities through the lens of human rights. Affective rights will also be discussed as requisite to formulating the optimal smart city. Moreover, this workshop will foster discussion around the still relatively nascent technology of Affective Computing, which is the application of AI (Artificial Intelligence), ML (Machine Learning), biometric measurement, sentiment analysis, and psychological factor assessment in determining and interacting with the affective states of the individual. This workshop is open to all stakeholders in smart city development and management, including computer scientists, engineers, smart city integrators, application developers, third party vendors, ethicists, city managers and administrators. It should be especially informative for oversight and governance organizations providing auditing and performance evaluations.","2158-3412","978-1-6654-3580-2","10.1109/ISTAS52410.2021.9629191","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9629191","Smart cities;human rights;ethics;collective bargaining;sustainable development","Smart cities;Ethics;Stakeholders;Media;Lenses;Industrial relations","biometrics (access control);data privacy;ethical aspects;learning (artificial intelligence);smart cities","human rights;smart system;personal information;potentially sensitive private information;human dignity;affective rights;smart city development;AI;smart city management;artificial intelligence;ML;machine learning;biometric measurement;sentiment analysis;psychological factor assessment","","","","","IEEE","6 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
