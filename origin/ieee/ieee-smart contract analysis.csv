Researchers have proposed many approaches to detecting them. However, empirical studies have shown that these approaches suffer from undesirable false positives and false negatives, when the code under detection involves the interaction between multiple smart contracts. In this paper, we propose an accurate and efficient cross-contract reentrancy detection approach in practice. Rather than design rule-of-thumb heuristics, we conduct a large empirical study of 11714 real-world contracts from Etherscan against three well-known general-purpose security tools for reentrancy detection. We manually summarized the reentrancy scenarios where the state-of-the-art approaches cannot address. Based on the empirical evidence, we present Clairvoyance, a cross-function and cross-contract static analysis to detect reentrancy vulnerabilities in real world with significantly higher accuracy. To reduce false negatives, we enable, for the first time, a cross-contract call chain analysis by tracking possibly tainted paths. To reduce false positives, we systematically summarized five major path protective techniques (PPTs) to support fast yet precise path feasibility checking.

Though most of the interest is generated by cryptocurrency related activities, it is becoming apparent that a much wider spectrum of applications can leverage the blockchain technology. The primary concepts enabling such general use of the blockchain are the so-called smart contracts, which are special programs that run on the blockchain. One of the most popular blockchain platforms that supports smart contracts are Ethereum. As smart contracts typically handle money, ensuring their low number of faults and vulnerabilities are essential. To aid smart contract developers and help maturing the technology, we need analysis tools and studies for smart contracts. As an initiative for this, we propose the adoption of some well-known OO metrics for Solidity smart contracts. Furthermore, we analyze more than 10,000 smart contracts with our prototype tool. The results suggest that smart contract programs are short, not overly complex and either quite well-commented or not commented at all. Moreover, smart contracts could benefit from an external library and dependency management mechanism, as more than 80% of the defined libraries in Solidity files code the same functionalities.","","978-1-4503-5726-5","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8445056","static analysis;ethereum;smart contracts;metrics;complexity;blockchain","Contracts;Measurement;Libraries;Complexity theory;Tools;Cryptocurrency","contracts;cryptography;financial data processing;object-oriented methods","smart contract programs;ethereum smart contracts;popular blockchain platforms;smart contract developers;Solidity smart contracts;blockchain based decentralized cryptocurrency platforms;cryptocurrency related activities;OO metrics;prototype tool;Solidity files","","","","9","","26 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing method for defect detection of smart contract bytecode using symbolic execution does not take care of the accuracy and detection realtime at same time. In this paper a smart contract bytecode defect detection algorithm based on parallel symbolic execution is proposed. We split a smart contract in units of functions by analyzing the smart contract function selection process. A symbolic execution tree is constructed for each function to predict the function execution path. Then we partition the symbolic execution tree into multiple sub-trees evenly. Finally, a process pool is used to perform parallel symbolic execution on those sub-trees to reduce the analysis time of smart contract defect detection. Experimental data shows our method has a significant improvement in detection efficiency compared with existing symbolic execution method. The speedup ratio is up to 3.1x in a 4-core computer. Besides, it does not introduce false positives or false negatives.","","978-1-7281-3657-8","10.1109/CIRSYSSIM.2019.8935603","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8935603","parallel optimization;smart contract;symbolic execution;defect detection;constraint solving","Smart contracts;Flow graphs;Task analysis;Security;Blockchain;Tools","cryptocurrencies;data flow analysis;program diagnostics;program testing;program verification;symbol manipulation;trees (mathematics)","smart contract defect detection;parallel symbolic execution;defect detection algorithm;smart contract function selection process;symbolic execution tree","","","","19","","19 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, the centralized architecture of the conventional surveillance systems is vulnerable to single point of failure and privacy breach owning to the lack of protection to the surveillance feed. This position paper introduces a novel secure smart surveillance system based on microservices architecture and blockchain technology. Encapsulating the video analysis algorithms as various independent microservices not only isolates the video feed from different sectors, but also improve the system availability and robustness by decentralizing the operations. The blockchain technology securely synchronizes the video analysis databases among microservices across surveillance domains, and provides tamper proof of data in the trustless network environment.

The paper aims to study the practice of code cloning among the smart contracts by analyzing two corpora. The first corpus, the ""Smart-Corpus"", includes smart contracts already deployed in the Ethereum blockchain. The second corpus, the ""Open-Zeppelin's Solidity Library"", is supervised by a community of developers who constantly take care to increase the security and efficiency of the smart contracts included in the corpus. From the comparative analysis of the corpora, we observe that the smart contracts developers frequently duplicate the code by cloning already existing smart contracts which are not part of the ""OpenZeppelin corpus"". In particular, we found that 79.1% of smart contracts contain duplicated code and only 18.4% of smart contracts reuse the code by implementing a smart corpus belonging to the OpenZeppelin repository. The paper discusses the advantages and the disadvantages of code duplication in the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem, and suggests to refer to the smart contracts of the OpenZeppelin's Solidity Library.

The smart contracts can facilitate, verify, and implement the negotiation between multiple parties, also guaranteeing transactions without a traditional legal entity. Many tools supporting the smart contracts development in different areas are flourishing because in Ethereum blockchain valuable assets are often involved. Some of the tools help the developer to find security vulnerabilities via static and/or dynamic analysis or to reduce the Gas fees consumption. Despite the plethora of such tools, there is no tool supporting smart contracts evaluation and analysis via a graphical representation for expert developers. The paper embraces this way to facilitate the developers' analysis activity, by proposing a graphical representation model to visualize smart contract source code. The paper makes available a tool via a web interface, which accepts the smart contract address as an input and produces a graphical representation of the smart contract as an output. The graphical representation can help developers to better understand the structure of smart contracts and share it with other developers. Moreover, some metrics, such as the relations among smart contracts, are easier to be understood via ""spatial"" than ""tabular"" representation. Indeed, representing smart contracts' metrics via visual representation facilitates the developers, who are used to analyse the source code by directly inspecting it or using other tools that provide the metrics in a table format. Finally, the paper provides detailed data regarding a smart contract to the developers and proposes a graphical representation of the smart contracts without obscuration of details, also highlighting areas of the code that are possibly too big in size and/or too complex via a diagram displaying their connections.","1534-5351","978-1-7281-9630-5","10.1109/SANER50967.2021.00090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9425959","Smart contract;Ethereum blockchain;visual analysis;class diagram","Measurement;Visualization;Law;Conferences;Smart contracts;Unified modeling language;Blockchain","blockchains;Internet","smart contract address;graphical representation;smart contracts development;smart contracts evaluation;smart contract source code;Ethereum blockchain;visual representation","","","","38","","11 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Centralized data trading platforms emerge to realize transactions of data commodities. However, centralized platforms lack trust and robustness. How to realize DPTs and DASTs in a decentralized way is a challenging issue. In this paper, a new transaction solution based on the smart contract-enabled blockchain technology is proposed, which consists of the DPT smart contract and DAST smart contract. The DPT smart contract is implemented to trade data packets. The DAST smart contract provides a competitive way to trade data analytics services. Both smart contracts are designed to enable entities in IIoT to execute DPTs and DASTs automatically and honestly. Moreover, the transaction disputes between different IIoT entities are solved by the big data center off-chain, and the treatment results will be recorded on the blockchain by the big data center. The DPT smart contract and DAST smart contract are implemented and tested on Remix integrated development environment to achieve DPTs and DASTs.

Everybody can write and deploy smart contracts on Ethereum, which causes a large collection of similar contracts via code reuse. In practice, code reuse in smart contract may amplify severe threats like security attacks, resource waste, etc. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study of code reuse in smart contracts for understanding the code reuse practice in the smart contract ecosystem. We first collect 146,452 open-source smart contract projects from Ethereum and then perform a detailed analysis. We first study how often the smart contract projects reuse and then we identify the top reused smart contracts and analyze how the developers revise smart contracts during reuse. Our research suggests that the code reuse in smart contract is quite frequent because about 26% contract code blocks are reused and the average time of reuse is 14.6. And the top reused contracts are almost all related to ERC20 token, which reveals that the current smart contract ecosystem is relatively homogenous.

Smart contracts create an environment in which a significant amount of operations become hands-free. This results in resource-friendliness because the system becomes less reliant on manual labor.

Solidity is the most mature high-level smart contract language. Ethereum is a hostile execution environment, where anonymous attackers exploit bugs for immediate financial gain. Developers have a very limited ability to patch deployed contracts. Hackers steal up to tens of millions of dollars from flawed contracts, a well-known example being ""The DAO"", broken in June 2016. Advice on secure Ethereum programming practices is spread out across blogs, papers, and tutorials. Many sources are outdated due to a rapid pace of development in this field. Automated vulnerability detection tools, which help detect potentially problematic language constructs, are still underdeveloped in this area. We provide a comprehensive classification of code issues in Solidity and implement SmartCheck - an extensible static analysis tool that detects them. SmartCheck translates Solidity source code into an XML-based intermediate representation and checks it against XPath patterns. We evaluated our tool on a big dataset of real-world contracts and compared the results with manual audit on three contracts. Our tool reflects the current state of knowledge on Solidity vulnerabilities and shows significant improvements over alternatives. SmartCheck has its limitations, as detection of some bugs requires more sophisticated techniques such as taint analysis or even manual audit. We believe though that a static analyzer should be an essential part of contract developers' toolbox, letting them fix simple bugs fast and allocate more effort to complex issues.","","978-1-4503-5726-5","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8445052","Ethereum;Solidity;smart contracts;static analysis;bug detection","Contracts;Static analysis;Tools;Computer bugs;Computer hacking","contracts;program debugging;program diagnostics;security of data;source code (software);XML","SmartCheck;Ethereum smart contracts;blockchain-based platform;decentralized network;high-level smart contract language;hostile execution environment;anonymous attackers;bugs;patch deployed contracts;flawed contracts;secure Ethereum programming practices;automated vulnerability detection tools;extensible static analysis tool;Solidity source code;XML-based intermediate representation;real-world contracts;manual audit;shows significant improvements;taint analysis;static analyzer;contract developers;financial gain","","1","1","41","","26 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this demo paper, we focus on the most common type of security bugs in smart contracts, i.e., reentrancy bug, which caused the famous DAO attack with a loss of 60 million US dollars. We presented ReGuard, an fuzzing-based analyzer to automatically detect reentrancy bugs in Ethereum smart contracts. Specifically, ReGuard performs fuzz testing on smart contracts by iteratively generating random but diverse transactions. Based on the runtime traces, ReGuard further dynamically identifies reentrancy vulnerabilities. In the preliminary evaluation, we have analyzed 5 existing Ethereum contracts.

On the other hand, there are millions of dollars carried by smart contracts in Ethereum blockchain, and hence, a faulty smart contract can lead to a huge monetary loss. Therefore, it is important for smart contract developers to fully test and check the correctness of their code before deploying it on the blockchain. In this paper, we propose a testing mechanism for smart contracts in the Solidity language, based on mutation testing. We analyzed a comprehensive list of known bugs in Solidity smart contracts and designed 10 classes of mutation operators inspired by the real faults. Our experimental results show that our proposed mutation operators can regenerate 10 out of 15 famous faulty smart contracts, which have resulted in millions of dollars loss.

Several re-entrancy attacks that aim to steal Ether, the cryptocurrency used in Ethereum, stored in deployed smart contracts were found in the recent years. A countermeasure to such attacks is based on dynamic analysis that executes the smart contracts themselves, but it requires the spending of Ether and knowledge of attack patterns for analysis in advance. In this paper, we present a static analysis tool named RA (Re-entrancy Analyzer), a combination of symbolic execution and equivalence checking by a satisfiability modulo theories solver to analyze smart contract vulnerabilities against re-entrancy attacks. In contrast to existing tools, RA supports analysis of inter-contract behaviors by using only the Ethereum Virtual Machine bytecodes of target smart contracts, i.e., even without prior knowledge of attack patterns and without spending Ether. Furthermore, RA can verify existence of vulnerabilities against re-entrancy attacks without execution of smart contracts and it does not provide false positives and false negatives. We also present an implementation of RA to evaluate its performance in analyzing the vulnerability of deployed smart contracts against re-entrancy attacks and show that RA can precisely determine which smart contracts are vulnerable.","","978-0-7381-0495-9","10.1109/Blockchain50366.2020.00048","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9284679","Ethereum;smart contracts;static analysis;EVM;symbolic execution;SMT solver","Smart contracts;Static analysis;Blockchain;Tools;Virtual machining;Peer-to-peer computing;Flow graphs","blockchains;computability;Java;program diagnostics;program verification;virtual machines","RA;re-entrancy attacks;Ethereum smart contracts;consensus-based blockchain;peer-to-peer network;dynamic analysis tool;static analysis tool;smart contract vulnerabilities;inter-contract behaviors;ethereum virtual machine bytecode;re-entrancy analyzer","","","","28","","11 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Slither allows for the application of commonly used program analysis techniques like dataflow and taint tracking. Our framework has four main use cases: (1) automated detection of vulnerabilities, (2) automated detection of code optimization opportunities, (3) improvement of the user's understanding of the contracts, and (4) assistance with code review. In this paper, we present an overview of Slither, detail the design of its intermediate representation, and evaluate its capabilities on real-world contracts. We show that Slither's bug detection is fast, accurate, and outperforms other static analysis tools at finding issues in Ethereum smart contracts in terms of speed, robustness, and balance of detection and false positives.

Ballot voting, and in recent times, electronic voting via electronic voting machines (EVMs) improves fairness by relying on centralized trust. Homomorphic encryption-based voting protocols also assure fairness but cannot scale to large scale elections such as presidential elections. In this paper, we leverage the blockchain technology of distributing trust to propose a smart contract-based protocol, namely, FASTEN. There are many existing protocols for voting using smart contracts. We observe that these either are not scalable or leak the vote tally during the voting stage, i.e., do not provide vote concealment. In contrast, we show that FASTEN preserves voter's privacy ensures vote concealment, immutability, and avoids double voting. We prove that the probability of privacy breaches is negligibly small. Further, our cost analysis of executing FASTEN over Ethereum is comparable to most of the existing cost of elections.","","978-1-6654-3578-9","10.1109/ICBC51069.2021.9461060","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9461060","Distributed Trust;Blockchain;Smart Contracts;Ethereum","Conferences;Smart contracts;Blockchain;Privacy breach;Cryptocurrency;Cost benefit analysis;Electronic voting","cryptographic protocols;data privacy;government data processing;politics","FASTEN;secure distributed voting;smart contracts;vote concealment;fair calculations;proxies voting;ballot voting;electronic voting machines;homomorphic encryption-based voting;scale elections;smart contract-based protocol;voting stage;double voting","","","","11","","24 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our tool, SolAnalyser, supports automated detection of 8 different vulnerability types that currently lack wide support in existing tools, and can easily be extended to support other types. We also implemented a fault seeding tool that injects different types of vulnerabilities in smart contracts. We use the mutated contracts for assessing the effectiveness of different analysis tools. Our experiment uses 1838 real contracts from which we generate 12866 mutated contracts by artificially seeding 8 different vulnerability types. We evaluate the effectiveness of our technique in revealing the seeded vulnerabilities and compare against five existing popular analysis tools - Oyente, Securify, Maian, SmartCheck and Mythril. This is the first large scale evaluation of existing tools that compares their effectiveness by running them on a common set of contracts. We find that our technique outperforms all five existing tools in supporting detection of all 8 vulnerability types and in achieving higher precision and recall rate. SolAnalyser was also faster in analysing the different vulnerabilities than any of the existing tools in our experiment.","2640-0715","978-1-7281-4648-5","10.1109/APSEC48747.2019.00071","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8945725","blockchain, smart contract, testing, static analysis, assertions, fault seeding","Smart contracts;Tools;Static analysis;Blockchain;Authorization","contracts;distributed databases;program diagnostics;security of data;software tools","SolAnalyser;transaction verification;credible transactions;vulnerability detection;Solidity smart contracts;fault seeding tool;smart contract testing;permissionless blockchains;Oyente analysis tool;mutated contracts;Securify;SmartCheck;Mythril","","","","40","","2 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To mitigate this problem, we propose Aroc, a general repairer that can automatically patch vulnerable deployed smart contracts. The core insight of Aroc is to generate a patch contract leveraging static analysis techniques to verify whether transactions obey secure states of the vulnerable contracts, and then abort those deviated transactions in advance. Take the three most serious bug types (i.e., reentrancy, arithmetic bugs, and unchecked low-level checks) as examples, we present how Aroc is able to automatically repairs them on chain. Experimental results show that Aroc can automatically repair 84.95% of the vulnerable contracts with an average correctness ratio of 91.43%.

Distributed ledger characteristics impose distinct requirements on smart contract design, implementation, deployment, and management. We briefly present the approach to the development of secure smart contracts, and highlight key smart contract vulnerabilities and the developer tools supporting smart contract security. We developed a secure, upgradeable modular multi-contract platform. It combines per-contract Smart Contract Tunnels and per-user-based access control to minimize vulnerabilities. The smart contract platform is comprised of service-agnostic, auxiliary, and service-specific smart contracts. It can be therefore easily adapted to different 5G application verticals. For illustration and evaluation, we elaborated on the proposed solution on a case of smart electric charging. During the design and development, state-of-the-art code analysis was applied.

In view of these numbers, it is necessary to develop automated methods for classifying contracts regarding their purpose, if one aims at a qualitative and quantitative understanding of what blockchain applications are used for at large. We approach the task by considering contracts as similar if their interfaces are. We encode interfaces and their interrelationships as graphs and explore several algorithms regarding their ability to find clusters of functionally similar contracts.

We achieve that by a thorough review of known vulnerabilities. In this work we also review the security code analysis tools used to identify known vulnerabilities. We conduct the investigation of security code analysis tools on Ethereum by assessing their effectiveness and accuracy on known issues on a representative sample of vulnerable contracts. We have used 21 clean, and 24 vulnerable contracts and four security tools: Oyente, Securify, Remix, and SmartCheck, to assess the quality of contemporary security analysis tools specific to Ethereum. The results indicate that there are overall inconsistencies between the tools in respect to different security properties.

Due to a large variation of contracts being traded in financial markets, a standard representation for contracts was required in order to eliminate the ambiguity imposed by natural languages. Peyton Jones et al. catered this need by proposing a combinator library embedded in Haskell which enabled contract representation and valuation. However, every financial contract represented as such suffered from the same fundamental problem. If a contract is executable, the parties involved in the contract needed to trust a central counterparty to give them the correct results after execution. The interference of this middleman introduced certain risks as well as a significant amount of overhead. In this paper, a novel approach to facilitate autonomous contract execution was proposed, exploiting the features and use cases of the Ethereum blockchain and its scripting language, Solidity. The approach involves transforming contracts written in Peyton Jones Contract Descriptive language (CDL) to Solidity using a special purpose compiler. The result of this transformation is a smart contract equivalent to the traditional financial contract. The transformed smart contract is deployed and executed on the Ethereum blockchain using an Ethereum client. The proposed solution was evaluated against existing attempts to design autonomous financial contracts. The research shows that a contract written using CDL can be transformed into a smart contract which executes autonomously in a trust-less environment. As a result, it was concluded that financial contracts could operate without a central counterparty with increased performance and reduced overheads in comparison to traditional financial contracts.","2472-7598","978-1-7281-5156-4","10.1109/ICTer48817.2019.9023652","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9023652","Financial Contracts;Smart Contracts;Compiler","Contracts;DSL;Transforms;Libraries;Cost accounting;Virtual machining","contracts;cryptography;distributed databases;financial data processing;functional languages;natural language processing;program compilers;text analysis","autonomous financial contracts;contract representation;Peyton Jones contract descriptive language;smart contract;natural languages;Haskell;Ethereum blockchain;Solidity scripting language;special purpose compiler","","1","","17","","5 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Experience shows that many deployed contracts are vulnerable to exploitation due to their poor design, which allows attackers to steal valuable assets from the involved parties. Therefore, an assessment approach that allows developers to recognise the consequences of deploying vulnerable contracts is needed. In this paper, we propose a debt-aware approach for assessing security design vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Our assessment approach involves two main steps: (i) identification of design vulnerabilities using security analysis techniques and (ii) an estimation of the ramifications of the identified vulnerabilities leveraging the technical debt metaphor, its principal and interest. We use examples of vulnerable contracts to demonstrate the applicability of our approach. The results show that our assessment approach increases the visibility of security design issues. It also allows developers to concentrate on resolving smart contract vulnerabilities through technical debt impact analysis and prioritisation. Developers can use our approach to inform the design of more secure contracts and for reducing unintentional debts caused by a lack of awareness of security issues.","","978-1-6654-1405-0","10.1109/TechDebt52882.2021.00010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9463047","smart contract;technical debt;security","Visualization;Smart contracts;Estimation;Tools;Software;Security","contracts;security of data","security design vulnerabilities;security analysis techniques;identified vulnerabilities;technical debt metaphor;vulnerable contracts;security design issues;smart contract vulnerabilities;technical debt impact analysis;prioritisation;secure contracts;smart contracts security technical debts;deployed contracts;debt-aware approach","","","","47","","25 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, getting smart contract data is a tedious process and public data-sets for smart contracts are not available for further analysis. Therefore, in this work, we collect a total of 1.9M smart contracts till the block height of 7.1M, and provide a first of its kind analysis across different parameters like duplicity, ether balance, ether moved, etc. We observe that across all these different parameters, only a small fraction of the smart contracts are dominant.

This article presents a novel static profiling technique for Ethereum smart contracts that, using static resource analysis, is able to generate upper-bound expressions that can be used to produce profiling information about the measure of interest. Unlike traditional profiling tools, we get upper-bounds on the measures of interest expressed in terms of the input arguments or the state variables of the smart contracts. The information that can be obtained by the upper-bounds allows us to detect gas-expensive fragments of a Solidity program or to spot resource-related vulnerabilities at specific program points of the program. Moreover, in this article we propose an automatic optimization of Solidity programs which reduces their gas consumption replacing the accesses to state variables by gas-efficient accesses to local variables.

However, the demand for video transcoding for various personal terminal devices results in the shortage of computing resources and the prolongation of processing delay in centralized video transcoding systems. To solve this issue, we propose a blockchain, especially, smart contract based scheme that can achieve decentralized and on-demand crowdsourcing for video transcoding, which remarkably mitigates the transcoding overhead. Specifically, our scheme consists of four key components such as employers, workers, task allocation, and payment. An employer initializes the smart contract, releases the task, and initiates the smart contract. Workers bid for the task, and the successful bidder will obtain the task and execute the task. The task allocation mechanism and the payment mechanism can guarantee the profits of both and encourage both as well. Moreover, the smart contract consists of the bidding contract and the task execution contract. The extensive analysis of our proposed scheme justified the feasibility, security for defending against typical threats, applicability in realistic situations, and portability for most multimedia such as videos and audios.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3043042","National Key Research and Development Program of China Project(grant numbers:2018YFF0212106); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972366,61962009); Major Scientific and Technological Special Project of Guizhou Province(grant numbers:20183001); Foundation of Guizhou Provincial Key Laboratory of Public Big Data(grant numbers:2018BDKFJJ009,2019BDKFJJ003,2019BDKFJJ011); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9285293","Blockchain;crowdsourcing;video transcoding;smart contracts","Crowdsourcing;Transcoding;Task analysis;Streaming media;Smart contracts;Blockchain;Resource management","contracts;Internet;resource allocation;transcoding;video coding;video streaming","smart contract based scheme;on-demand crowdsourcing;transcoding overhead;employer;task allocation mechanism;bidding contract;task execution contract;audios;crowdsourcing video transcoding scheme;blockchain smart contracts;streaming media;users every day;TV series;personal terminal devices results;centralized video transcoding systems","","","","34","CCBY","7 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

At the time of this writing, there were over 10 million smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum networks and this number continues to grow at a rapid pace. Smart contracts are often written in a Turing-complete programming language called Solidity, which is not easy to audit for subtle errors. Further, since smart contracts are immutable, errors have led to attacks resulting in losses of cryptocurrency worth 100s of millions of USD and reputational damage. Unfortunately, manual security analyses do not scale with size and number of smart contracts. Automated and scalable mechanisms are essential if smart contracts are to gain mainstream acceptance. Researchers have developed several security scanners in the past couple of years. However, many of these analyzer either do not scale well, or if they do, produce many false positives. This issue is exacerbated when bugs are triggered only after a series of interactions with the functions of the contract-under-test. A depth-n vulnerability, refers to a vulnerability that requires invoking a specific sequence of n functions to trigger. Depth-n vulnerabilities are time-consuming to detect by existing automated analyzers, because of the combinatorial explosion of sequences of functions that could be executed on smart contracts. In this paper, we present a technique to analyze depth-n vulnerabilities in an efficient and scalable way by combining symbolic execution and data dependency analysis. A significant advantage of combining symbolic with static analysis is that it scales much better than symbolic alone and does not have the problem of false positive that static analysis tools typically have. We have implemented our technique in a tool called MPro, a scalable and automated smart contract analyzer based on the existing symbolic analysis tool Mythril-Classic and the static analysis tool Slither. We analyzed 100 randomly chosen smart contracts on MPro and our evaluation shows that MPro is about n-times faster than Mythril-Classic for detecting depth-n vulnerabilities, while preserving all the detection capabilities of Mythril-Classic.","2332-6549","978-1-7281-4982-0","10.1109/ISSRE.2019.00052","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8987460","Blockchain;Smart Contract;Symbolic Execution;Static Analysis","","contracts;cryptocurrencies;program diagnostics;program testing;program verification;symbol manipulation;Turing machines","Slither tool;Mythril-Classic tool;symbolic execution;data dependency analysis;depth-n vulnerability;contract-under-test;cryptocurrency;Solidity;Turing-complete programming language;Ethereum networks;trusted third-party;programmable trust mechanism;executable programs;scalable testing;symbolic analysis;static analysis;MPro;automated smart contract analyzer;scalable contract analyzer","","1","","18","","10 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

How to make good use of those different kinds of features for effective classification is a problem need to be solved. Inspired by this, we proposed a smart contract classification approach based on Bi-LSTM model and Gaussian LDA, which can use a variety of information as inputs of the model, including source code, comments, tags, account and other content information. Bi-LSTM is utilized to capture grammar rules and context information in source code, while Gaussian LDA model is employed to generate comments feature where the semantics of the comments are enriched by embeddings.

Matching-based detection methods extrapolating known vulnerabilities to unknown have proven to be effective in other platforms. However, directly adopting the technique to smart contracts is obstructed by two issues, i.e., diversity of bytecode generation resulting from the rapid evolution of compilers and interference of noise code easily caused by the homogeneous business logics. To address the problems, we propose contract bytecode-oriented normalization and slicing techniques to augment bytecode matching. Specifically, we conduct data- and instruction-level normalizations to uniform the bytecode generated by different compilers, and enforce contract-specific slicing by tracking data- and control-flows with simulated bytecode executions to prune the noise code as far as possible. Based on the above techniques, we design an unsupervised graph embedding algorithm to encode the code graphs into quantitatively comparable vectors. The potentially vulnerable smart contracts can be identified by measuring the similarities between their vectors and known vulnerable ones. Our evaluations have shown the efficiency (0.47 seconds per contract on average), effectiveness (160 verified true positives) and high precision (91.95% for top-ranked). It is worth noting that, we also identify dozens of honeypot contracts, further demonstrating the capability of our method.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2021.3050051","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:U1836209,61802413); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Research Funds of Renmin University of China(grant numbers:19XNLG02,20XNLG03); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9316905","Vulnerable smart contracts;graph embedding;bytecode matching","Smart contracts;Task analysis;Interference;Blockchain;Prototypes;Business;Virtual machining","contracts;graph theory;pattern matching;program compilers;security of data;software maintenance;unsupervised learning","matching-based detection methods;resultant financial losses;smart contract vulnerabilities;graph embedding;honeypot contracts;potentially vulnerable smart contracts;unsupervised graph;simulated bytecode executions;contract-specific slicing;instruction-level normalizations;bytecode matching;slicing techniques;homogeneous business logics;noise code;bytecode generation","","","","48","IEEE","8 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the self-interested nature of the EVs together with the information asymmetry between the energy demand and supply sides makes the design a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a queuing network-based model to characterize the charging process of the multiple EVs in a renewable energy-aided charging station. Based on the model, we adopt a contract theoretic approach to design an optimal charging policy in an information asymmetry scenario. Furthermore, we propose the new contract-based charging rate assignment and admission control schemes that maximize the utility of the charging station under certain charging constraints. To derive the optimal contract, we present a two-step iterative algorithm and prove its convergence. We evaluate the proposed schemes based on the IEEE 69-bus distribution test system.

The smart contract is one of the most important features in blockchain applications, which implements trusted transactions without third parties. However, with the rapid development, blockchain smart contracts have also exposed many security problems, and some attacks caused by contract vulnerabilities have led to terrible losses. In order to better deal with such dilemma, making a comprehensive survey about the security verification of blockchain smart contracts from major scientific databases is quite indispensable. Even though the significance of studying security verification of blockchain smart contracts is evident, it is really fresh yet. The major contributions of our survey work come from three aspects. First, after retrieving all-sided research studies, we select 53 most related papers to show the state-of-the art of this topic, where 20 papers focus on dealing with security assurance of blockchain smart contracts, and 33 papers focus on the correctness verification of blockchain smart contracts. Second, we propose a taxonomy toward the topic of security verification of blockchain smart contracts and discuss the pros and cons of each category of related studies. Third, through in-depth analysis of these studies, we come to know that the correctness verification of smart contracts based on the formal method has already become the more significant and more effective method to validate whether a smart contract is credible and accurate.

In particular, we analyze the specifics of deployment code used beyond actually deploying a contract in a quantitative and qualitative manner. To this end, we identify code patterns in deployment code by distilling recurring code skeletons from all external transactions and internal messages that contain deployment code. Tracking the use of these patterns reveals a set of vulnerabilities in contracts targeted by skillfully crafted deployment code. We summarize the encountered exploitative cases of collateral use of deployment code and report respective quantities. Example scenarios illustrate the recent usage. Collateral use of deployment code starts to appear in the middle of 2018 and becomes dominant among contract creations in autumn of 2018.

Many of them support transactional applications known as smart contracts, which access and modify the shared world state. Permissionless blockchains are completely decentralized and do not require mutual trust between interacting peers, but at the expense of having low performance and limited data confidentiality capabilities. On the other hand, permissioned blockchains solve these issues, but sacrifice complete decentralization and involve more trust assumptions. Therefore, there is no single blockchain system suitable for all use-cases. However, this becomes a serious integration challenge for enterprises that need to interact with multiple permissioned and permissionless blockchains in the same context. To facilitate this, we propose an approach that enables composing smart contract functions of various permissioned and permissionless blockchain systems by providing the ability to invoke them directly from business process models using a new task type. To keep this task blockchain-agnostic, we designed a generic technique to identify smart contract functions, as well as a generic metric to describe the degree-of-confidence in the finality of blockchain transactions. Thereby, the proposed approach extends our previous work, BlockME, which provides business modeling extensions only suitable for interacting with permissionless blockchains.

The only proper way to protect a smart contract is to fix potential risks in its code before it is deployed to the blockchain. However, existing tools for smart contract security analysis focus on the detection of bugs but seldom consider the code fix issues. Meanwhile, it is often time-consuming and error-prone for a developer to understand and fix flawed code manually. In this paper we propose SMARTSHIELD, a bytecode rectification system, to fix three typical security-related bugs (i.e., state changes after external calls, missing checks for out-of-bound arithmetic operations, and missing checks for failing external calls) in smart contracts automatically and help developers release secure contracts. Moreover, SMARTSHIELD guarantees that the rectified contract is not only immune to certain attacks but also gas-friendly (i.e., a slightly increase of gas cost). To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of SMARTSHIELD, we applied it to 28,621 real-world buggy contracts on Ethereum blockchain (as of January 2<sup>nd</sup>2019). Experiment results demonstrated that among 95,502 insecure cases in those contracts, 87,346 (91.5%) of them were automatically fixed by SMARTSHIELD. A following test with both program analysis and real-world exploits further testified that the rectified contracts were secure against common attacks. Moreover, the rectification only introduced a 0.2 % gas increment for each contract on average.","1534-5351","978-1-7281-5143-4","10.1109/SANER48275.2020.9054825","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9054825","Ethereum blockchain;Smart contract;Automated bug fix;Bytecode rectification","","contracts;cryptography;distributed databases;program debugging","security response mechanisms;smart contract security analysis;Ethereum blockchain;real-world buggy contracts;rectified contract;secure contracts;security-related bugs;bytecode rectification system;flawed code;code fix issues;code patching;automatic smart contract protection;SMARTSHIELD","","6","","68","","2 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite significant advances in new technologies and treatment options providers still suffer from poor procurement, ordering, forecasting, and distribution practices. Group Purchasing Organizations (GPOs) are an important stakeholder in HCSC and benefit providers with cost savings, volume discounts, and vendor selection. However, the current GPO contract process is time-consuming and lacks efficiency. Hence, our proposed solution integrates blockchain technology and decentralized storage to promote transparency, streamlines communication with stakeholders, and minimize the procurement timeline while avoiding pricing discrepancies and inaccuracies. Our solution connects all the stakeholders such as manufacturer, GPO, distributor, and provider using Ethereum network. In this paper, we propose a blockchain solution using smart contracts to automate the GPO contract process. We propose a generic framework for contracting process in the HCSC with detailed algorithms depicting various interactions among HCSC stakeholders. The smart contract code was developed and tested using Remix IDE and the code is publicly shared via Github.

Blockchain has the capability to optimize market transactions using automation with high security to create a peer-to-peer trading environment. It reduces operational risk by enabling transparency, certitude and interoperability in fragmented market systems to eliminate the need for third party regulators to a large extent. In this paper, a decentralized stock exchange system is implemented with Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) on Ethereum for executing trades by separating concerns into three different smart contracts: buyer, seller and exchange. The self-enforcing smart contracts used are highly flexible and optimized for parallel operation due to functional abstraction. The multi-contract model is compared to a single contract model, which handles all three aspects within the same contract, by executing sample trading data from NASDAQ. Transaction fees for the miner at 161 Gwei is 27.96% lesser for the single-contract system and 98.75% lesser for the multi-contract system than the brokerage fees of traditional traders for the same transactions. Experimental results indicate that the separation of concern results in transaction costs being 98.26% lower and transaction time being 28.70% lower than having a single contract.","","978-1-6654-3568-0","10.1109/AIIoT52608.2021.9454189","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9454189","Blockchain;Smart Contract;Stock Market Decentralization;Distributed Ledger Technology;Ethereum","Regulators;Automation;Distributed ledger;Smart contracts;Blockchain;Data models;Peer-to-peer computing","blockchains;contracts;financial data processing;open systems;stock markets","smart contract abstraction;decentralized blockchain based stock exchange;stock markets;centralized structure;operational trade policies;high transaction times;market transactions;peer-to-peer trading environment;interoperability;fragmented market systems;decentralized stock exchange system;distributed ledger technology;multicontract model;single contract model;transaction fees;single-contract system;multicontract system;Ethereum","","","","49","","21 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They handle the exchange of valuable assets like crypto-currencies or tokens in a transparent, decentralized manner. Being computer programs, they are also prone to programming errors, which have already lead to spectacular losses. Therefore, methods and tools have emerged to support the development of secure smart contracts and to aid the analysis of deployed ones. Assessing the quality of such tools turns out to be difficult. There are academic tools, tools developed by companies, and community tools in open repositories, but no comprehensive survey that may serve as a guide. Most discussions of related work in research papers are not helpful either, as they concentrate on methods rather than tools, base their review on publications about the tools rather than the tools themselves, or disregard tools outside of academia. Our survey aims at filling this gap by considering tools regardless of their provenance and by installing and testing them. It is meant as a guide for those who intend to analyze already deployed code, want to develop secure smart contracts, or plan to teach a related subject.

The hosting mode is that the data are completely hosted in the data trading center, so the data trading center retains the data. On the surface, the aggregation mode is that the data trading center is not to retain the data of trading, but actually, it has the ability to retain the data. There is a fundamental difference between the ability to retain the data and the inability to retain the data. These two trading modes cause the data owners to be afraid to share data trading. In this paper, we propose a solution to the data trading mode based on the smart contract using blockchain and machine learning. Our solution takes advantage of the immutability, tamper-proof and traceability of blockchain, the programmability of smart contract, and the verification of data availability by the similarity learning to propose a challenge response mechanism between the data purchaser and the data owner, an off-chain download mechanism between the data purchaser and the data storage service provider, and an arbitration mechanism for the controversy resolution of the data trading. The challenge response mechanism is used to authenticate and authorize the data owner, the off-chain download mechanism is used to authenticate and authorize the data purchaser to download the purchased data, and the similarity learning is used to deal with the controversy over the data availability in the data trading. The design and implementation of data trading smart contract successfully achieved the goal of removing the trusted third party in the data trading, and thus, the problem that the data trading center has the ability to retain the data in the process of the data trading is solved, as well as the automatic payment by using the Ethereum encrypted currency among the trading participants is realized.

Second, to ensure financial stability in the blockchain-enabled market and to match the difficulty of the received tasks with the ability of the workers, we design a dynamic, hierarchical pricing mechanism based on economic modeling methods and heterogeneous agent theory. With this mechanism, the market is divided dynamically into multiple levels according to the remuneration of the customers' offer and the market value of the workers' resources. Additional constraints are proposed to avoid possible malicious trading behavior from workers in the resource lending process. We prove theoretically the rationality of our model and demonstrate the dynamics of the model. We show that the market price and demand can be convergent and test the cost of executing the two smart contracts.

The characteristics of blockchain such as immutability and openness, however, have made DApps more vulnerable to various security risks, and thus it has become of great significance to validate the integrity of DApps before they actually operate upon blockchain. Recently, research on vulnerability in smart contracts (a building block of DApps) has been actively conducted, and various vulnerabilities and their countermeasures were reported. However, the effectiveness of such countermeasures has not been studied well, and no appropriate methods have been proposed to evaluate them. In this paper, we propose a software tool that can easily perform comparative studies by adding existing/new countermeasures and labeled smart contract codes. The proposed tool demonstrates verification performance using various statistical indicators, which helps to identify the most effective countermeasures for each type of vulnerability. Using the proposed tool, we evaluated state-of-the-art countermeasures with 237 labeled benchmark codes. The results indicate that for certain types of vulnerabilities, some countermeasures show evenly good performance scores on various metrics. However, it is also observed that countermeasures that detect the largest number of vulnerable codes typically generate much more false positives, resulting in very low precision and accuracy. Consequently, under given constraints, different countermeasures may be recommended for detecting vulnerabilities of interest. We believe that the proposed tool could effectively be utilized for a future verification study of smart contract applications and contribute to the development of practical and secure smart contract applications.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3091317","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT)(grant numbers:2019R1F1A1063272,2020R1F1A1048395,2020R1A4A3079947); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9461797","Blockchain;countermeasure;Ethereum;smart contract;vulnerability","Smart contracts;Blockchain;Tools;Bitcoin;Benchmark testing;Software tools;Licenses","blockchains;contracts;software tools;statistical analysis","stastical indicators;secure Ethereum smart contract applications;labeled benchmark codes;software tool;digital security;blockchain technology;smart contract codes;DApps;reliable decentralized applications","","","","44","CCBYNCND","21 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While an increasing number of research works have been focusing on such problems, many of them adopted pattern-based heuristics (e.g., reentrancy) to find payment-related attacks thus can incur a considerably large portion of both false positives and negatives. To overcome these limitations and achieve better payment security on blockchain, we introduced a new class of payment attacks in this paper, i.e., unfair payment (UP). Compared to existing heuristics, UP semantically captures a wider range of payment attacks. Furthermore, we highlighted the general framework SAFEPAY to systematically detect UP. The key insight behind is a novel security invariant, i.e., fair value exchange (FVE), which models the fairness for blockchain payments between multiple parties. More specifically, SAFEPAY systematically explores the transaction space of a given smart contract and generates a bounded set of transaction sequences. For each of the sequence, SAFEPAY reports a UP attack once a violation on FVE is confirmed. We have further instantiated SAFEPAY for Ethereum and applied it in real-world smart contracts. In the empirical evaluation, SAFEPAY managed to identify previously unreported UP attacks and effectively avoid false alarms compared to analyzers in the literature as well.","2575-8462","978-1-7281-7626-0","10.1109/SRDS51746.2020.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9252068","Smart contract;Unfair payment;Fair value exchange","Systematics;Smart contracts;Blockchain;Metadata;Stability analysis;Space exploration;Reliability","contracts;cryptocurrencies;distributed databases;financial data processing","payment security;payment attacks;unfair payment;security invariant;blockchain payments;UP attack;Ethereum;smart contracts;blockchain ecosystem;digital assets;payment-related attacks;SAFEPAY;smart contract;pattern-based heuristics","","2","","24","","12 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent researches focus on the symbolic execution and formal analysis of smart contract for vulnerability detection, yet to achieve a precise and scalable solution. Although several methods have been proposed to detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts, there is still a lack of effort that considers combining expert-defined security patterns with deep neural networks. In this paper, we explore using graph neural networks and expert knowledge for smart contract vulnerability detection. Specifically, we cast the rich control- and data- flow semantics of the source code into a contract graph. Then, we propose a novel temporal message propagation network to extract graph feature from the normalized graph, and combine the graph feature with expert patterns to yield a final detection system.

In some industries such as finance, confidentiality is paramount to protect business-critical information from becoming public; however, in a smart contract, information needs to be known and independently verified. A zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) can be used to obscure this information when there are only two parties in the contract; however, ZKPs do not have a mechanism to handle situations in which multiple parties are involved. We introduce, discuss, and simulate a consensus-based secret sharing protocol which provides zero knowledge of personal information, only allows members to participate if they have a key, and only works when a specified number of members “vote.” This enhances the ability for smart contracts to work in situations where majority votes are needed, but the confidentiality of members needs to be preserved.","","978-1-7281-5347-6","10.1109/IWBIS.2019.8935853","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8935853","zero-knowledge proof;Shamir’s secret sharing;blockchain;smart contracts;consensus voting","Blockchain;Smart contracts;Cryptography;Probabilistic logic;Image color analysis;Industries","contracts;cryptographic protocols;data privacy","blockchain smart contracts;smart contract;blockchain permit;credible transactions;business-critical information;zero-knowledge proof;multiple parties;consensus-based secret sharing protocol;zero knowledge;personal information","","1","","19","","19 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unfortunately, we cannot simply extrapolate those techniques to smart contracts. The major challenge is that smart contracts exhibit a nonuniform data access mode. Other than accessing the data via uniform addresses, smart contracts compromise multiple addressing modes, including flat address mode and key-value mode. More seriously, accessing a key-value table usually involves additional hash operations to obtain the keys. In this paper, we propose a DSE framework to resolve the nonuniform data access in smart contracts. More specifically, we exactly track the symbolic variables with concrete addresses and compute the actual/hash keys for table-like accesses. We also take the symbolic keys into account to distinguish data accesses incidentally with the same concrete keys resulting from artificially generated values. We describe the DSE framework in operational semantics. On top of the framework, we implement an integer overflow detector NOVA and a multi-transactional vulnerability detector MTVD. The experiments show that NOVA outperforms state-of-the-art analysis tools in detecting the integer overflows with much higher precision and recall, 94.2% and 93.0%, respectively.

Therefore, for consumers, it is necessary to establish a reliable system that can trace the source of products. However, most existing traceability systems tend to lack transparency, data is primarily stored within the enterprise, and the cost of tampering with data is very low. Besides, the supply chain nodes are easy to evade responsibility when product safety or quality issues arise under the traditional centralized management model, and it is difficult to trace the root of issues. The development of blockchain technology provides us with new ideas for realizing the traceability of products in supply chain scenarios. Due to its characteristics of decentralization, transparency, and immutability, blockchain can be effectively used to alleviate the above problems. In this paper, we propose a product traceability system based on blockchain technology, in which all product transferring histories are perpetually recorded in a distributed ledger by using smart contracts and a chain is formed that can trace back to the source of the products. In particular, we design an event response mechanism to verify the identities of both parties of the transaction, so that the validity of the transaction can be guaranteed. And all events are permanently stored in the form of logs as a basis for handling disputes and tracking responsible entities. Furthermore, a system prototype is constructed based on the testing framework of Truffle.

It contains two main functions, the first is syntax topological analysis of smart contract invocation relationship, to help developers to understand their code structure clearly; the second is logic risk (which may lead to vulnerabilities) detection and location, and label results on topology diagram.

However, the identity privacy and data security issues raise great concerns about the secure spectrum sharing among multi-OPs. To address these challenges, a permissioned blockchain trust framework is proposed for the spectrum sharing in multi-OPs wireless communication networks in this paper. The Multi-OPs Spectrum Sharing (MOSS) smart contract is designed on the constructed permissioned blockchain to implement the spectrum trading among multi-OPs. Without the need of trustless spectrum broker, the MOSS smart contract enforces multi-OPs to share the spectrum truthfully and designs a punishment mechanism to punish malicious OPs. The MOSS smart contract is tested on the Remix integrated development environment (IDE) and the gas costs of MOSS smart contract is estimated. The performance analysis of the proposed permissioned blockchain trust framework demonstrates that the privacy, openness and fairness of the proposed solution are better than traditional spectrum allocation solutions.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2992385","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2020kfyXGYJ115); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9086020","Spectrum sharing;permissioned blockchain;smart contract;privacy;security","Blockchain;Wireless communication;Smart contracts;Security;Resource management;Bandwidth;Privacy","5G mobile communication;contracts;cryptography;data privacy;distributed databases;radio spectrum management;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;trusted computing;wireless sensor networks","fifth-generation wireless communication networks;identity privacy;data security;secure spectrum sharing;permissioned blockchain trust framework;trustless spectrum broker;MOSS smart contract;spectrum sharing transactions;multioperator wireless communication networks;multiOP spectrum sharing smart contract;integrated development environment","","6","","29","CCBY","4 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Smart Contracts are executed by every miner in the system serially without any parallelism, both inter and intra-Smart Contracts. Such a serial execution inhibits the scalability required to obtain extremely high throughput pertaining to computationally intensive tasks deployed with such Smart Contracts. While significant advancements have been made in the field of concurrency, from GPU architectures that enable massively parallel computation to tools such as MapRe-duce that distributed computing to several nodes connected in the system to achieve higher performance in distributed systems, none are incorporated in blockchain-based distributed computing. The team proposes a novel blockchain that allows public nodes in a permission-independent blockchain to deploy and run Smart Contracts that provide concurrency-related functionalities within the Smart Contract framework. In this paper, the researchers present “ConCurrency,” a blockchain network capable of handling big data-based computations. The technique is based on currently used distributed system paradigms, such as MapReduce, while also allowing for fundamental parallelly computable problems. Concurrency is achieved using a sharding protocol incorporated with consensus mechanisms to ensure high scalability, high reliability, and better efficiency.

Hence, market participants can enter into bilateral contracts to hedge against the pool price volatility. Few studies on the modeling of bilateral market in microgrid, especially with respect to the uncertainty of market have been carried out. The goal is to obtain a sustainable structure using the values given by the load and distributed generators (DG), and show that, given the market risk, social welfare is affected.

Automation of processes with smart contracts is one of these features that significantly enlarge the scope of a blockchain implementation. Smart contracts help automate business processes by modeling business activities on the distributed ledger. Smart contracts are significantly different from other programs from a defect fixing and security issue handling perspective. The opportunity of fixing such issues is only available in the narrow window before registering the contract on to the blockchain. After a smart contract becomes a part of the chain, it is not possible to update or fix any issues. This distinct nature of smart contracts makes it essential to detect the program issues early on by paying attention to security smells. Security smells are clues that point to a deeper problem in the programming space. In this study, we review the literature and identify vulnerabilities that programmers and beneficiaries of smart contracts must avoid. We explain these security smells and categorize them based on their nature. We also review the applications that detect these vulnerabilities and provide information about their approach and coverage. Our main contribution is the evaluation of smart contracts as a platform or aid for mission-critical applications such as access control platforms. We conducted this evaluation by identifying the issues related to smart contracts and informing the reader about the problem, challenges, and techniques.

However, due to the intrinsic complexity of Ethereum bytecode (especially in jump resolution), static analysis encounters significant obstacles that reduce the accuracy of exiting automated tools. This paper presents a novel static analysis algorithm based on the symbolic execution of the Ethereum operand stack that allows us to resolve jumps in Ethereum bytecode and to construct an accurate control-flow graph (CFG) of the compiled smart contracts. EtherSolve is a prototype implementation of our approach. Experimental results on a significant set of real world Ethereum smart contracts show that EtherSolve improves the accuracy of the execrated CFGs with respect to the state of the art available approaches. Many static analysis techniques are based on the CFG representation of the code and would therefore benefit from the accurate extraction of the CFG. For example, we implemented a simple extension of EtherSolve that allows to detect instances of the re-entrancy vulnerability.","2643-7171","978-1-6654-1403-6","10.1109/ICPC52881.2021.00021","Dipartimenti di Eccellenza; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9462980","Reverse engineering;Static analysis;Smart contract;Ethereum","Smart contracts;Prototypes;Static analysis;Blockchain;Detectors;Tools;Complexity theory","blockchains;contracts;flow graphs;Java;program diagnostics","official blockchain;static analysis algorithm;Ethereum operand stack;accurate control-flow graph;compiled smart contracts;EtherSolve;Ethereum smart contracts;static analysis techniques;security problems;substantial financial value;smart contracts source code;compiled Ethereum bytecode","","","","42","","28 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our previous work shows the possibility of achieving decentralized runtime verification by incorporating some mechanisms of the blockchain technology for locating the accountability when error occurs. However, traditional blockchain technology disallows branching and hence does not support verification of tasks which involves multiway dependencies. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach of smart marker that can be included in a blockchain to enable multiway branching and merging in order to verify the fulfillment of tasks that involve one-to-many and many-to-one dependencies. The design of smart marker satisfies three requirements of recognizability, compatibility, and authenticability.

Due to the persistence characteristic of blockchain, revising a deployed smart contract is almost impossible. Both realities heighten the risks of managing funds and thus increase the demand for conducting sufficient testing to Ethereum Smart Contracts (ESC). Different from the conventional software, ESC is a gas-driven program, where developers must charge gases for deploying and testing it. Therefore, it is important to provide a cost-effective yet representative test suite, where its representativeness can be typically measured by its branch coverage. In this paper, we deem the problem of ESC test generation as a Pareto minimization problem, and three objectives, minimizing (1) uncovered branch coverage, (2) time cost, and (3) gas cost are considered. Then, we propose a random based and an NSGA-II based multi-objective approach to seek cost-effective test-suites.

In general this is not possible, but it is possible to follow best practices in order to maximize the chance of success. A smart contract is intended to encode business logic and is therefore at the heart of every new business on the Ethereum blockchain. We have investigated how to measure the success of smart contracts, and whether successful smart contracts have characteristics that less successful smart contracts lack. The appearance of a smart contract on a listing website such as Etherscan or StateoftheDapps is such a characteristic. In this paper, we present a three-pronged analysis of the relative success of listed smart contracts. First, we have used statistical analysis on the publicly visible transaction history of the Ethereum blockchain to determine that listed contracts are significantly more successful than their unlisted counterparts. Next, we have conducted a survey among more than 200 developers via an anonymous online survey about their experience with the listing process. A significant majority of respondents do not believe that listing a contract itself contributes to its success, but they believe that the extra attention that is typically paid in tandem with the listing process does contribute. Finally, based on the respondents' answers, we have drafted 10 recommendations for developers and validated them by submitting them to an international panel of experts.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2957284","BUT Project(grant numbers:FIT-S-17-4014); IT4IXS: IT4Innovations Excellence in Science Project(grant numbers:LQ1602); National Research Foundation Singapore(grant numbers:NRF2016NCR-NCR002-028); National Cybersecurity Research and Development Directorate; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8919981","Software engineering;product development;technology social factors;computers and information processing;social implications of technology;blockchain;ethereum;smart contracts;new product development;business success;recommendations for developers","Contracts;Product development;Measurement;History;Peer-to-peer computing","contracts;electronic money;Internet;statistical analysis","listed smart contracts;Ethereum blockchain;listing website;listed contracts;listing process;Etherscan;StateoftheDapps","","2","","28","CCBY","3 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, each coin has two sides. There is a follow-up challenging issue in the distributed and trustless computing environment. The centralized computation offloading without tamper-proof audit causes security threats. It could not guard against false-reporting, free-riding behaviors, spoofing attacks and repudiation attacks. Thus, we leverage the blockchain technology to achieve decentralized PVFC. Request posting, workload undertaking, task evaluation and reward assignment are organized and validated automatically through smart contract executions. Network activities in computation offloading become transparent, verifiable and traceable to eliminate security risks. To this end, we introduce network entities and design interactive smart contract operations across them.

The goal of this paper is to propose an approach where blockchain technology and Smart Contracts are used to ensure the required level of trust when implementing the aforementioned services.

A large number of interdependencies between the components and services and reliance on trusted third parties hinders the ability to safely and securely identify and authenticate the components and services. We propose Idenx, a blockchain-based identity management system for mitigating supply chain attacks. Idenx uses the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) to construct the identity of every component or service and further uses a Secure Pseudo-Random Function (PRF) with the identity to derive an attribute identifier for the component or service. Our approach for identifying and authenticating a component is based on Idenx smart contracts that facilitate supply chain security agreements without trusted third parties. We presented the security analysis of Idenx and the results show that it is resilient to supply chain attacks.

Many techniques based on symbolic execution, fuzzing, and static analysis are used to detect contract vulnerabilities. Most of the current analyzers only consider vulnerability detection intra-contract scenarios. However, Ethereum contracts usually interact with others by calling their functions. A bug hidden in a path that depends on information from external contract calls is defined as an inter-contract vulnerability. Failure to deal with this kind of bug can result in potential false negatives and false positives. In this work, we propose Pluto, which supports vulnerability detection in inter-contract scenarios. It first builds an Inter-contract Control Flow Graph (ICFG) to extract semantic information among contract calls. Afterward, it symbolically explores the ICFG and deduces Inter-Contract Path Constraints (ICPC) to check the reachability of execution paths more accurately. Finally, Pluto detects whether there is a vulnerability based on some predefined rules. For evaluation, we compare Pluto with five state-of-the-art tools, including Oyente, Mythril, Securify, ILF, and Clairvoyance on a labeled benchmark and 39,443 real-world Ethereum smart contracts. The result shows that other tools can only detect 10% of the inter-contract vulnerabilities, while Pluto can detect 80% of them on the labeled dataset. Beyond that, Pluto has detected 451 confirmed vulnerabilities on real-world contracts, including 36 vulnerabilities in inter-contract scenarios. Two bugs have been assigned with unique CVE identifiers by the US National Vulnerability Database (NVD).

PFM can also issue court injunctions for the breaches. The underlying concept in PFM is built upon the notion of factor analysis and stochastic modeling from the discipline of Data Science. High performance computing (HPC) cluster at University of Luxembourg (HPC @ Uni.lu) and docker (a software container platform) were used to emulate contractual environment of three service providers: Redis, MongoDB, and Memcached Servers. The results showed that court injunction(s) was issued only for Redis and MongoDB Servers. Technically, this difference could be attributed to the fact that Memcached is simply used for caching and therefore, it is less prone to breach of contract. Whereas, Redis and MongoDB as databases and message brokers are performing more complex operations and are more likely to cause a breach. This research will benefit enterprises that view breach of contract as a limiting factor for implementation of smart contract in cyber-physical system or internet of things.","1949-4106","978-1-5386-0759-6","10.1109/HONET.2017.8102214","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8102214","blockchain;smart contract;contract law;breach of contract;court injunction;unsupervised machine learning;factor analysis;stochastic modeling;structural equation modeling","","cloud computing;contract law;contracts;data protection;parallel processing;probability;stochastic processes","smart contract;court injunction;PFM;high performance computing cluster;blockchain network;legal protection;service level agreements;law as a service;LaaS;online contracts breaches;SLA;probability based factor model;factor analysis;stochastic modeling;HPC","","2","","15","","9 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To acquire a holistic overview of an inter-organizational process, insight in both its control flow and data model is required. Business artifacts are a well-positioned mechanism to model these two dimensions. However, when business artifacts and their associated lifecycle and information models are shared between organizations, a single source of truth is preferred. To maintain such a single source without centralized administration, blockchain-based smart contracts may be used. We claim that an artifact-centric approach to business processes is well-suited for smart contract implementations. However, the conceptual relationship between business process artifacts and smart contracts has not yet been extensively analyzed. In this paper, we present a novel ontological analysis of artifact-centric processes managed by smart contracts. We adopt the method of enterprise ontology and regard an inter-organizational process as a set of causally related transactions in which the state of the lifecycle and associated data objects of business artifacts is transformed by sending messages to smart contracts.

To mitigate these limitations, we designed the SafePay analysis framework to find unfair payments in Ethereum smart contracts. Compared to existing analyzers, SafePay can detect potential blockchain transactions with feasible exploits thus effectively avoid false reports. Specifically, the detection is driven by a systematic search for violations on fair value exchange (FVE), i.e., a new security invariant introduced in SafePay to indicate that each party “fairly” pays to others. The preliminary evaluation validated the efficacy of SafePay by reporting previously unknown issues and decreasing the number of false alarms.","2575-8411","978-1-7281-7002-2","10.1109/ICDCS47774.2020.00116","Research and Development; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9355580","Smart contract;Symbolic execution;Taint analysis;Insecure message call","Systematics;Conferences;Smart contracts;Blockchain;Cryptocurrency;Security;Distributed computing","blockchains;contracts;data mining;electronic money","unfair payments;Ethereum blockchain;external attacks;broken payments;digital assets;reentrancy bug;false alarms;SafePay analysis framework;Ethereum smart contracts;potential blockchain transactions;false reports","","","","8","","23 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These stations can be launched/owned by different owners, referred to as charging station providers (CSPs), which make energy contracts with a smart grid provider (SGP). However, there exists a shortage of mutual economic strategy between the SGP and CSPs in an energy request/transfer competition due to the selfish nature among them. In this paper, we propose an economic model leveraging a multi-principal single-agent (referred to as common agency) contract policy, aiming at maximizing the utilities of multiple CSPs while optimizing the utility of the SGP in an EV network. In particular, we first develop the common agency-based contract problem as a non-cooperative energy contract optimization problem, in which each CSP can maximize its utility given the common constraints from the SGP and the contracts of other CSPs. To deal with this problem, we develop an iterative energy contract algorithm to find an equilibrium contract solution where the contracts from the CSPs can produce maximum utilities of the CSPs and satisfy the constraints of the SGP. Through numerical results, we show that our proposed model can improve the social welfare of the EV network up to 54% and the utilities of CSPs up to 60% compared with the baseline method in which each CSP obtains the amount of energy that is proportional to its energy request.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-8298-8","10.1109/GLOBECOM42002.2020.9322376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9322376","Energy demand;electric vehicle;charging station;common agency;contract theory","Contracts;Cascading style sheets;Optimization;Charging stations;Energy exchange;Economics;Smart grids","contracts;economics;electric vehicle charging;hybrid electric vehicles;iterative methods;optimisation;smart power grids","common agency-based economic model;electric vehicle networks;hybrid vehicles;smart grid provider;SGP;iterative energy contract algorithm;equilibrium contract solution;charging station providers;CSPs;multiprincipal single-agent;contract policy;noncooperative energy contract optimization problem;numerical analysis;social welfare;baseline method","","","","19","","25 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent studies discovered many severe security and performance issues in smart contracts by applying static program analysis techniques to them.

Aims: The objective of this work is to understand the capabilities of static program analysis techniques to identify CFTs, and to investigate how static program analysis techniques can be improved if the CFTs are complemented. Method: We perform a comprehensive empirical study on six widely-used tools for smart contract analysis by using all deployed smart contracts to understand their capabilities to recognize CFTs. We capture all execution traces of all smart contracts to evaluate the number of CFTs covered by traces that are not found by those tools. We enhance a state-of-the-art tool, OYENTE for discovering vulnerabilities in smart contracts with the CFTs covered by traces to investigate how the tool is improved. Results: These studied tools fail to identify all CFTs due to several reasons, e.g., incomplete code patterns. Execution traces effectively complement these tool in recognizing CFTs. By including the CFTs covered by traces, the false negative rate of OYENTE can be reduced by up to 30%. Conclusions: Our study underlines the ineffectiveness of static analysis techniques due to the incapabilities of CFT identification.","1949-3789","978-1-7281-2968-6","10.1109/ESEM.2019.8870156","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8870156","","Smart contracts;Tools;Blockchain;Computer security;Static analysis","contracts;program diagnostics;security of data","static program analysis techniques;CFTs;smart contract analysis;static analysis techniques;control flow identification;control flow transfers","","2","","40","","17 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In a proposed game, the aggregator as a principal will purchase a certain amount of power from different-category ESs with the cheapest pricing options available, and at the same time the ESs, acting as agents will maximize their utilities by selling their power to the aggregator instead of feeding the grid at a low rate. The developed optimal contract-based scheme, which can be implemented distributed manner, allows different-category ESs to sell their power at different prices based on their unit production cost to maximize their benefits, and the total cost to the aggregator is minimized.

It accelerates various services such as automatic meter reading, time-of-use (TOU) pricing, demand-response management, and many more. Though it has growing security and privacy concerns and the detection of malicious activity is a critical security task that sacrifices the overall Quality-of-Service (QoS) of SG and Quality-of-Experience (QoE) for customers. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a data analytics Scheme ArMor for malicious activity detection on the blockchain (BC)-based SG system. The ArMor detects data integrity issues in real-time like false data injection attack and SM failure. Here, we proposed a unique ARIMA-based malicious activity detection model and classified the customer. Then, we proposed a Smart Contract (SC)-based incentive mechanism for utility providers handling the malicious activity at their end. It prevents the entry of malicious data into the SG system as transactional data once stored in BC, it is secured using SC. The obtained results are compared against parameters like prediction accuracy, latency, and data storage cost compared to the state-of-the-art approaches to designate the efficacy of the proposed scheme.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-8298-8","10.1109/GLOBECOM42002.2020.9348061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9348061","Attacks Detection;ARIMA;Data Analytics;Smart Contract;Smart Grid;Blockchain","Data analysis;Quality of service;Real-time systems;Smart grids;Security;Quality of experience;Task analysis","automatic meter reading;blockchains;computer network security;data analysis;data privacy;quality of experience;quality of service;smart meters;smart power grids","malicious behaviors;next-generation energy system;advanced metering infrastructure;smart meter;end-consumers;automatic meter reading;time-of-use pricing;demand-response management;critical security task;quality-of-service;quality-of-experience;blockchain-based SG system;data integrity issues;false data injection attack;SM failure;unique ARIMA-based malicious activity detection model;malicious data;transactional data;data storage cost;smart contract;incentive mechanism;ArMor data analytics scheme;malicious behavior identification;blockchain-based smart grid system;QoS;QoE","","","","19","","15 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To express and enforce protocols, Nomos is based on shared binary session types. To control resource usage, Nomos employs automatic amortized resource analysis. To prevent the duplication or deletion of assets, Nomos uses a linear type system. A monad integrates the effectful session-typed language with a general-purpose functional language. Nomos' prototype implementation features linear-time type checking and efficient type reconstruction that includes automatic inference of resource bounds via off-the-shelf linear optimization. The effectiveness of the language is evaluated with case studies on implementing common smart contracts such as auctions, elections, and currencies. Nomos is completely formalized, including the type system, a cost semantics, and a transactional semantics to deploy Nomos contracts on a blockchain.

Due to the immense interest in smart contracts in academia, the research community of smart contract security has made a significant improvement recently. Researchers have reported various security vulnerabilities in smart contracts, and developed static analysis tools and verification frameworks to detect them. However, it is unclear whether such great efforts from academia has indeed enhanced the security of smart contracts in reality. To understand the security level of smart contracts in the wild, we empirically studied 55,046 real-world Ethereum smart contracts written in Solidity, the most popular programming language used by Ethereum smart contract developers. We first examined how many well-known vulnerabilities the Solidity compiler has patched, and how frequently the Solidity team publishes compiler releases. Unfortunately, we observed that many known vulnerabilities are not yet patched, and some patches are not even sufficient to avoid their target vulnerabilities. Subsequently, we investigated whether smart contract developers use the most recent compiler with vulnerabilities patched. We reported that developers of more than 98% of real-world Solidity contracts still use older compilers without vulnerability patches, and more than 25% of the contracts are potentially vulnerable due to the missing security patches. To understand actual impacts of the missing patches, we manually investigated potentially vulnerable contracts that are detected by our static analyzer and identified common mistakes by Solidity developers, which may cause serious security issues such as financial loss. We detected hundreds of vulnerable contracts and about one fourth of the vulnerable contracts are used by thousands of people. We recommend the Solidity team to make patches that resolve known vulnerabilities correctly, and developers to use the latest Solidity compiler to avoid missing security patches.","1558-1225","978-1-4503-7121-6","","National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:NRF-2017R1A2B3012020,2017M3C4A7068177); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9283944","Empirical Study;Smart Contracts;Solidity;Security Patches","Smart contracts;Static analysis;Manuals;Tools;Encoding;Security;Software engineering","C++ language;contracts;electronic commerce;program compilers;program diagnostics;security of data;telecommunication security","smart contract security;security vulnerabilities;real-world Ethereum smart contracts;Ethereum smart contract developers;Solidity team;real-world Solidity contracts;vulnerability patches;missing security patches;potentially vulnerable contracts","","","","54","","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In such networks, the diverse IoT devices harvest the data from the remote environments and relay it to multiple intermediate agents over the wireless links towards the cloud for storage, analysis and decision making. Such systems require highly trustworthy data to guarantee accurate and timely decisions. However, in most of the cases, the IoT data becomes dubious during the transmission towards the cloud. Ensuring data provenance in such a heterogeneous multi-layered system is a critical security issue. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a secure data provenance framework for cloud-centric IoT network by utilizing the immutable, deterministic and public nature of the blockchain smart contracts with the traditional cloud infrastructure. In the framework, the cryptographic hash of the device metadata is stored in the blockchain whereas actual data is stored off-chain i.e., in the cloud, making it highly scalable for a dense deployment of IoT devices in the network. Multiple smart contracts are stationed in the blockchain to guarantee the provenance receipt to the data stored in the cloud. The initial evaluation revealed that the proposed framework is highly acceptable in achieving the data provenance for large-scale cloud-centric IoT networks.","","978-1-5386-9380-3","10.1109/SmartWorld.2018.00175","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8560153","Data provenance;Security;Integrity;Private blockchain;Smart contracts","","cloud computing;contracts;decision making;Internet of Things;meta data;storage management;trusted computing","highly trustworthy data;accurate decisions;timely decisions;IoT data;ensuring data provenance;multilayered system;critical security issue;secure data provenance framework;cloud-centric IoT network;blockchain smart contracts;traditional cloud infrastructure;actual data;multiple smart contracts;large-scale cloud-centric IoT networks;mission-critical applications;smart grids;surveillance systems;diverse IoT devices;multiple intermediate agents;decision making","","12","","42","","6 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, smart contracts, which transact valuable tokens and cryptocurrencies, are compiled to very low-level bytecode. This bytecode is the ultimate semantics and means of enforcement of the contract. We present the Gigahorse toolchain. At its core is a reverse compiler (i.e., a decompiler) that decompiles smart contracts from Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode into a highlevel 3-address code representation. The new intermediate representation of smart contracts makes implicit data- and control-flow dependencies of the EVM bytecode explicit. Decompilation obviates the need for a contract's source and allows the analysis of both new and deployed contracts. Gigahorse advances the state of the art on several fronts. It gives the highest analysis precision and completeness among decompilers for Ethereum smart contracts - e.g., Gigahorse can decompile over 99.98% of deployed contracts, compared to 88% for the recently-published Vandal decompiler and under 50% for the state-of-the-practice Porosity decompiler. Importantly, Gigahorse offers a full-featured toolchain for further analyses (and a “batteries included” approach, with multiple clients already implemented), together with the highest performance and scalability. Key to these improvements is Gigahorse's use of a declarative, logic-based specification, which allows high-level insights to inform low-level decompilation.","1558-1225","978-1-7281-0869-8","10.1109/ICSE.2019.00120","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8811905","Ethereum;Blockchain;Decompilation;Program Analysis;Security","Smart contracts;Blockchain;Virtual machining;Task analysis;Java;Security","contracts;cryptocurrencies;distributed databases;formal specification;program compilers;program diagnostics;virtual machines","Gigahorse;low-level decompilation;program analysis;blockchain;logic-based specification;cryptocurrencies;Ethereum virtual machine bytecode;EVM bytecode;Porosity decompiler;Vandal decompiler;Ethereum smart contracts","","4","","36","","26 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, persistence and auditability of stored data in blocks into the blockchain provide the confidence of using the correct data when needed later and adds transparency, anonymity, and traceability at the same time. To fulfill such a goal, in this article, we design a new smart contract-based blockchain-envisioned authenticated key agreement mechanism in a smart farming environment. The device-to-device (D2D) authentication phase and device-to-gateway (D2G) authentication phase support mutual authentication and key agreement between two Internet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled devices and between an IoT device and the gateway node (GWN) in the network, respectively. The blocks are created by the edge servers on the authenticated data of IoT devices received from the GWNs and then sent to the cloud server (CS). The smart contract-based consensus mechanism allows verification and addition of the formed blocks by a peer-to-peer (P2P) CSs network. The security of the proposed scheme is done through formal and informal security analysis, and also using the formal security verification tool.

Quite a number of solutions have emerged zooming in on contact tracing, combating misinformation, data aggregation and analysis as well as test result certification with blockchain technology been the core. Aside the reliance on centralized architectures and use of permissioned/consortium blockchain, conspicuously missing in existing solutions based on blockchain is the work around the immutability feature of the technology given the fact that a person's test result is not static but dynamic. In this paper, we propose a solution using blockchain and smart contract that allows for state changes to be made by authorized entities.

A notorious example of such cases are Ponzi schemes, i.e. a financial frauds that require investors to be repaid through the investments of others who have just entered the scheme. Within the Ethereum blockchain, several contracts have been identified as being Ponzi schemes. The paper proposes a machine learning model that uses textual classification techniques to recognize contracts emulating the behavior of a Ponzi scheme. Starting from a contracts dataset containing exclusively Ponzi schemes uploaded between 2016 and 2018, we built models able to properly classify Ponzi schemes contracts. We tested several models, some of which returned an overall accuracy of 99% on classification. The best model turned out to be the linear Support Vector Machine and the Multinomial Naive Bayes model, which provides the best results in terms of metrics evaluation.","","978-1-6654-4567-2","10.1109/WETSEB52558.2021.00012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9474794","Blockchain;Smart Contract;Ethereum;Web Scraping;Ponzi Scheme;Fraud Detection;Transactions;Text Classification.","Support vector machines;Measurement;Publishing;Smart contracts;Machine learning;Blockchain;Programming","Bayes methods;contracts;fraud;investment;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;support vector machines;text analysis","exclusively Ponzi schemes;Ponzi schemes contracts;evaluating Machine-learning techniques;smart Ponzi schemes;peer programming;general-purpose smart contracts;Ponzi scheme;Ethereum blockchain;machine learning model;textual classification techniques","","","","15","","8 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At the same time, it also attracts the attentions of attackers. Fake deposit, as one of the most representative attacks (vulnerabilities) related to exchanges and tokens, has been frequently observed in the blockchain ecosystem, causing large financial losses. However, besides a few security reports, our community lacks the understanding of this vulnerability, for example its scale and the impacts. In this paper, we take the first step to demystify the fake deposit vulnerability. Based on the essential patterns we have summarized, we implement DEPOSafe, an automated tool to detect and verify (exploit) the fake deposit vulnerability in ERC-20 smart contracts. DEPOSafe incorporates several key techniques including symbolic execution based static analysis and behavior modeling based dynamic verification. By applying DEPOSafe to 176,000 ERC-20 smart contracts, we have identified over 7,000 vulnerable contracts that may suffer from two types of attacks.

Optimizing inventory levels and adjusting replenishment policies have significant effects on the operational performance and profitability of supply chains. Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) is a mutually beneficial arrangement between supplier and buyer, where the supplier is responsible for making inventory and replenishment decisions based on buyers' inventory status. Potential benefits of VMI include reducing inventories, enabling information sharing, eliminating safety stock, and reducing purchasing related costs across the supply chain. In today's supply chains, VMI operations face critical challenges related to data integrity, transparency, traceability, and single point of failure due to its centralized architecture. Blockchain technology is a distributed ledger that ensures a transparent, safe, and secure exchange of data among supply chain stakeholders. The advantages of adopting blockchain technology for VMI operations in a supply chain include decentralized control, security, traceability, and auditable time-stamped transactions. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based approach using smart contracts to transform VMI supply chain operations. We propose a generic framework using Ethereum smart contracts and decentralized storage systems to automate the processes and information exchange and detailed algorithms that capture the interactions among supply chain stakeholders. The smart contract code was developed and tested in Remix environment. We present cost and security analysis incurred by the stakeholders in the supply chain.

But in fact, due to the incomplete third-party payment mechanism and the intrusion risk of various charging Trojan, it is easy to cause a trust crisis. The existing centralized framework often leads to information asymmetry between the two parties. Therefore, how to realize the fairness of payment and the auditability of assets in the distributed system is a challenging problem. The emerging blockchain technology provides a new method with its openness, transparency and verifiability. Existing researches do not provide a complete shopping model for consumers, most of which focuses on payments or only on asset delivery. In this paper, we propose an auditable fair payment and physical asset delivery protocol based on smart contracts. Three types of smart contracts are designed to achieve reliable and fair payment among merchants, consumers and logistics companies. The traceability and auditability of blockchain provide an effective method to audit assets and data sharing in the whole transportation. In view of the phenomenon of goods being switched, the way of ”pre-verification” is added. In order to prevent the illegal elements to fake pickup code, induce consumers to conduct illegal operations, cause property loss, in our system the pickup codes are generated by consumers to reduce the risk of fraud. In addition, our plan designs a complete return process for the first time, providing better service experience and higher efficiency for consumers.

This technology enables consumers to make agreements in a transparent and conflict-free environment. However, the security vulnerabilities within these smart contracts are a potential threat to the applications and their consumers and have shown in the past to cause huge financial losses. In this paper, we propose a framework that combines static and dynamic analysis to detect Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability due to an unexpected revert in Ethereum Smart Contracts. Our framework, SmartScan, statically scans smart contracts under test (SCUTs) to identify patterns that are potentially vulnerable in these SCUTs and then uses dynamic analysis to precisely confirm their exploitability of the DoS-Unexpected Revert vulnerability, thus achieving increased performance and more precise results. We evaluated SmartScan on a set of 500 smart contracts collected from the Etherscan.

Generally, a smart contract is a piece of executable code that automatically runs on the blockchain to enforce an agreement preset between parties involved in the transaction. As an innovative technology, smart contracts have been applied in various business areas, such as digital asset exchange, supply chains, crowdfunding, and intellectual property. Unfortunately, many security issues in smart contracts have been reported in the media, often leading to substantial financial losses. These security issues pose new challenges to security research because the execution environment of smart contracts is based on blockchain computing and its decentralized nature of execution. Thus far, many partial solutions have been proposed to address specific aspects of these security issues, and the trend is to develop new methods and tools to automatically detect common security vulnerabilities. However, smart contract security is systematic engineering that should be explored from a global perspective, and a comprehensive study of issues in smart contract security is urgently needed. To this end, we conduct a literature review of smart contract security from a software lifecycle perspective. We first analyze the key features of blockchain that can cause security issues in smart contracts and then summarize the common security vulnerabilities of smart contracts. To address these vulnerabilities, we examine recent advances in smart contract security spanning four development phases: 1) security design; 2) security implementation; 3) testing before deployment; and 4) monitoring and analysis.

To improve the total utility of auction participants, this paper proposes a smart-contract-based double auction mechanism, named long-term auction for mobile blockchain (LAMB). The subtasks can be offloaded from one mobile device to heterogeneous edge servers. Also, LAMB satisfies the economic properties of an auction mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that, the utility and utilization ratio can be achieved by 130.55% higher and 138.64% higher, respectively, in comparison to the existing auction algorithm WBD. Furthermore, the proposed LAMB can guarantee long-term performance for task offloading, and it can achieve automatic execution in an autonomous and secure environment.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2974750","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2018YFB1003201); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672171); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018B030311007,2018B010107003,2019B010121001); Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi Province(grant numbers:2018GXNSFAA138082); Guangxi Key Laboratory of Cryptography and Information Security(grant numbers:GCIS201816); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9001115","Mobile blockchain;smart contract;edge computing;offloading;resource allocation","Contracts;Task analysis;Mobile handsets;Servers;Edge computing;Computational modeling","cloud computing;computational complexity;contracts;cryptography;knapsack problems;mobile commerce;telecommunication security","NP-hard problem;long-term auction for mobile blockchain;mobile blockchain computation offloading;smart contract-based long-term auction;task offloading;heterogeneous edge servers;LAMB;smart-contract-based double auction mechanism;auction participants;multichoice multidimensional knapsack problem;mobile blockchain network;computation offloading;automatic parallel execution;blockchain tasks;computation-intensive tasks;mobile device","","","","55","CCBY","18 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we conduct the first investigation on Solidity, the recommended compiler, and reveal that it fails to optimize gas-costly programming patterns. In particular, we identify 7 gas-costly patterns and group them to 2 categories.

While straight-forward centralized approaches provide a basic solution to the problem, unfortunately they are limited to a single point of trust and involve a single point of control. This paper presents decentralized techniques for supporting self-emerging data using smart contracts in Ethereum blockchain networks. We design a credible and enforceable smart contract for supporting self-emerging data release. The smart contract employs a set of Ethereum peers to jointly follow the proposed timed-release service protocol allowing the participating peers to earn the remuneration paid by the service users. We model the problem as an extensive-form game with imperfect information to protect against possible adversarial attacks including some peers destroying the private data (drop attack) or secretly releasing the private data before the release time (release-ahead attack). We demonstrate the efficacy and attack-resilience of the proposed techniques through rigorous analysis and experimental evaluation.

Since current symbol execution tools often fall into path explosion and thus lead to inefficient detection, this paper expands Mythril's framework to optimize its performance. Firstly, it finds out potential vulnerable code regions using static analysis and identifies critical paths that may have security defects. Then, aiming at the problem that traditional search algorithms cannot actively locate and explore critical paths, this paper presents a multi-objective oriented path search (MOPS) strategy based on path priority. This strategy guides dynamic symbolic execution to cover critical paths quickly, avoiding blind traversal of program execution paths. Finally, it describes security rules and proposes corresponding detection logics for different vulnerability categories. This paper analyzes over 1000 smart contracts extracted from Etherscan. Compared with existing tools based on symbolic execution, the proposed method can reduce time consumption by around 35% while ensuring the accuracy of vulnerability detection. Moreover, existing tools often issue warnings that do not actually cause financial losses.

The existing researches on the combination of blockchain and access control have some disadvantages, such as the difficulty of managing access rights, inefficient access efficiency, and the difficulty of supporting lightweight IOT devices. This paper proposes an IoT access control model based on blockchain smart contract, called SCBAC. Firstly, by adopting the idea of IoT Attributes Based Access Control(ABAC), the model supports a dynamic, fine-grained access control. Secondly, by deploying the access control strategy on the blockchain in the form of smart contracts, the computing pressure of IoT devices is reduced, so that the model can be applied to lightweight IoT devices and has tamper resistance and traceability characteristics. The idea of tokens is adopted into the strategy, and subjects obtain access rights by applying for tokens in advance, which improves access efficiency. In addition, Trust recommendation algorithm is adopted in the model, which effectively solves the problem of identity fraud in access control. Finally, we build a prototype system to verify this proposed model, through case analysis and security analysis, it shows that this access control model is effective and versatile.

Such privacy-preserving smart contract applications need to be able to securely maintain users' sensitive inputs off the blockchain until a prescribed execution time and then automatically make the inputs available to enable on-chain execution of the target function at the execution time, even if the user goes offline. While straight-forward centralized approaches provide a basic solution to the problem, unfortunately they are limited to a single point of trust. This paper presents a new decentralized privacy-preserving transaction scheduling approach that allows users of Ethereum-based decentralized applications to schedule transactions without revealing sensitive inputs before an execution time window selected by the users. The proposed approach involves no centralized party and allows users to go offline at their discretion after scheduling a transaction. The sensitive inputs are privately maintained by a set of trustees randomly selected from the network enabling the inputs to be revealed only at the execution time. The proposed protocol employs secret key sharing and layered encryption techniques and economic deterrence models to securely protect the sensitive information against possible attacks including some trustees destroying the sensitive information or secretly releasing the sensitive information prior to the execution time.

Therefore, how to design an effective and secure computing resource allocation mechanism is attracting increasing attention. A lot of works have been done to design an effective computational resource market for IoT, but the problems of vulnerability and inefficiency still exist. In this paper, we propose a two-level Stackelberg game-based computing resource trading mechanism for mobile IoT devices with a credit-based payment approach, which is implemented by smart contracts on blockchain. In our model, the Stackelberg game consists of two levels, i.e., leader-level and user-level. In the leader-level, the computing service provider (CSP) and its agent constitute a composite leader. The agent purchases computing resource from CSP on credit and acts as a broker among leader-level and user-level reselling these computing resources to users. In the user-level, every user experiences social externality, which means users are interdependent. The leader-level subgame makes credit payment easier by making loaning and trading become a joint credit payment. The user-level subgame makes the market more active and closer to reality by introducing social externality. Besides, smart contracts can prevent malicious behaviors such as delay payment. We also conduct equilibrium analysis and prove the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium in our Stackelberg game-based model. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to evaluate the cost of smart contracts and the performance of each entity with the proposed pricing mechanism.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2020.3024729","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9200703","computing resource trading;edge-cloud computing;Stackelberg game;social externality;smart contract;mobile blockchain","Contracts;Computational modeling;Resource management;Games;Internet of Things","","","","","","","IEEE","18 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Demand Response (DR) contracts is a type of program in smart grid where the customer is free to select a type of contract which is given by the utility and is one of the growing factor which affects the load forecasting results in the Smart Grid, therefore in order to do a complete evaluation of smart grid performance and to accomplish an accurate load forecasting results the different types of contracts should also be studied. The purpose of this study is to accomplish two goals. The first one is to develop a suitable model which can incorporate various factors that can affect the load forecasting results. The subsequent goal is to identify the impact of the demand response contracts on the load forecasting results.

Each gas unit must be paid using Ether, the crypto-currency of the platform. Due to smart contracts interactions evolving over time, analyzing the behavior of smart contracts is very challenging. We address this challenge in our paper. We develop for this purpose an innovative approach based on the non-negative tensor decomposition PARATUCK2 combined with long short-term memory (LSTM) to assess if predictive analysis can forecast smart contracts interactions over time. To validate our methodology, we report results for two use cases.

Normally people think that they are not suffering or affected by the disease because they do not have symptoms. But it does not necessarily mean a person with no symptom has no chronic disease. This paper presents design and prototype implementation of a blockchain system which remotely monitors patient health records. The patient monitoring system is a big challenge and other security threats arises as the health care data transferred from one to another and authorization to create and read transactions, is a major concern related to data loss. The data loss of the patient protected health information which are generated from the devices should be handled carefully. So in this paper we proposed a solidity based smart contract run over a Ethereum virtual machine to facilitate the secure analysis and storing of transactions from and to the sensors. Using the Ethereum protocol, based on a private blockchain and writing the smart contracts to keep track of the patient health information. We have created an automatic system through which the sensors collects the data, then communicates with the decentralized application via the smart contract. The method inside the smart contract collects data when they are called, also reads and writes transactions of all events on the Ethereum virtual network. This solidity based smart contract system along with injected web3, metamask, and truffle environment would support alert transaction to the patient and medical professionals.","","978-1-6654-2536-0","10.1109/ICEPE50861.2021.9404496","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9404496","Blockchain;IOT Healthcare;Smart Contracts;Secure Remote Patient Monitoring;Ethereum;PHI Chronic Illness","Patient monitoring;Smart contracts;Blockchain;Medical services;Writing;Sensor systems and applications;Virtual machining","blockchains;contracts;diseases;handicapped aids;health care;medical information systems;patient monitoring;virtual machines","automatic system;Ethereum virtual network;smart contract system;medical professionals;smart healthcare system;chronic -illness patient;chronic disease;disability people;symptom;blockchain system;patient health records;patient monitoring system;security threats;health care data;data loss;patient protected health information;Ethereum virtual machine;secure analysis;private blockchain;patient health information","","","","18","","21 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Scammers take advantage of the pseudo-anonymity of blockchain to implement financial fraud. The Ponzi scheme, one of the main scam methods, has defrauded investors of large amounts of money, thereby harming their interests and hindering the application of blockchain. Unfortunately, the current detection technology typically largely relies on the source code of the contract or uses a single feature which does not fully represent the contract characteristics. In such a case, the detection of Ponzi schemes with high efficiency becomes urgent. In this paper, we propose an image-based scam detection method using an attention capsule network (SE-CapsNet) focused on Ethereum. The sequence of bytecode, the opcode frequency, and the application binary interface (ABI) call are extracted as features from the contract bytecode and ABI, further converted into grayscale images, and then mapped into three color channels to generate RGB images, which are used as the input of the model for detecting the Ponzi scheme contract. In addition, we employ fancy PCA for data augmentation to reduce the impact of imbalanced data on the detection results. Experimental results show that the image-based detection method using deep learning models can effectively detect contracts before transactions occur. Among them, our proposed SE-CapsNet obtains great detection results, with an F1 score of 98.38%.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3059806","Natural Science Foundation of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region(grant numbers:2019D01C062,2019D01C041,2020D01C028); Graduate Research Innovation Project of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region(grant numbers:XJ2020G065,XJ2019G063); National Innovation Training Project for College Students(grant numbers:201910755030); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:12061071); Higher Education of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region(grant numbers:XJEDU2017M005,XJEDU2020Y003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9354770","Blockchain;capsule network;Ethereum;Ponzi scheme;smart contract","Feature extraction;Contracts;Smart contracts;Blockchain;Malware;Task analysis;Gray-scale","computer crime;contracts;feature extraction;financial data processing;fraud;image colour analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);principal component analysis;security of data;Web sites","SE-CapsNet obtains great detection results;image-based detection method;Ponzi scheme contract;RGB images;grayscale images;application binary interface call;contract characteristics;current detection technology;main scam methods;blockchain technology;attention capsule network;image-based scam detection method","","","","42","CCBY","16 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To this aim, in this paper, we extend some previous works in order to allow the self-management of AmI devices enabling them to directly interact with maintenance service providers.

Unlike traditional programs, once deployed, they cannot be modified. As smart contracts carry more value, they become more of an exciting target for attackers. Over the last years, they suffered from exploits costing millions of dollars due to simple programming mistakes. As a result, a variety of tools for detecting bugs have been proposed. Most of these tools rely on symbolic execution, which may yield false positives due to over-approximation. Recently, many fuzzers have been proposed to detect bugs in smart contracts. However, these tend to be more effective in finding shallow bugs and less effective in finding bugs that lie deep in the execution, therefore achieving low code coverage and many false negatives. An alternative that has proven to achieve good results in traditional programs is hybrid fuzzing, a combination of symbolic execution and fuzzing. In this work, we study hybrid fuzzing on smart contracts and present ConFuzzius, the first hybrid fuzzer for smart contracts. ConFuzzius uses evolutionary fuzzing to exercise shallow parts of a smart contract and constraint solving to generate inputs that satisfy complex conditions that prevent evolutionary fuzzing from exploring deeper parts. Moreover, ConFuzzius leverages dynamic data dependency analysis to efficiently generate sequences of transactions that are more likely to result in contract states in which bugs may be hidden. We evaluate the effectiveness of ConFuzzius by comparing it with state-of-the-art symbolic execution tools and fuzzers for smart contracts. Our evaluation on a curated dataset of 128 contracts and a dataset of 21K real-world contracts shows that our hybrid approach detects more bugs than state-of-the-art tools (up to 23%) and that it outperforms existing tools in terms of code coverage (up to 69%). We also demonstrate that data dependency analysis can boost bug detection up to 18%.","","978-1-6654-1491-3","10.1109/EuroSP51992.2021.00018","Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR)(grant numbers:13192291); European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(grant numbers:830927); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9581164","Ethereum;smart contracts;hybrid fuzzing;data dependency analysis;genetic algorithm;symbolic execution","Codes;Costing;Smart contracts;Computer bugs;Tools;Fuzzing;Programming","","","","","","52","","4 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The algorithm supports energy transactions between peers (both producers and consumers) and could be one of the main executables implemented using a blockchain platform.

In addition, these systems are often inharmonious across platforms and do not put the privacy desires of patients first. While HIPAA and other laws are put in place to protect patient medical record security and privacy, these antiquated systems inherently hinder patient security and privacy. In this paper, we propose a novel data sharing and management scheme that empowers patients over their records by leveraging the security and privacy benefits of blockchain and smart contracts. In comparison to current methods for healthcare records management, our proposed scheme empower patients over their records and minimizes the dependencies on record-generating institutions. It also allows the patients to selectively share their records and disclose certain parts with specific data users based on the privacy preferences desired. In our security and privacy analysis, we show that patients can protect against potential threats to securely and privately share their records. Moreover, in our performance discussions, we show that smart contract design and development is key.","2325-2626","978-1-5386-9223-3","10.1109/ICCNC.2019.8685552","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8685552","Blockchain;smart contract;healthcare records management","Blockchain;Smart contracts;Privacy;Cryptography;Data privacy;Peer-to-peer computing","data privacy;electronic health records;health care;security of data","data management;medical records;patient medical record security;patient security;healthcare records management;record-generating institutions;privacy analysis;smart contract design;electronic health records;medical treatment;decentralized data sharing;hierarchical data sharing","","3","","12","","11 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Estimation and costing is estimating the amount of material to be used and also calculating the approximate budget required for construction. Calculating the amount appropriately is very important to manage the costing. This estimation and analysis is mostly done manually. Maintaining high accuracy is very difficult at human level and even a small human error can cost a huge loss. Hence to eliminate the human errors and to enhance accuracy we are proposing a model in intelligent system. In this mode, input will be in the form of AutoCAD drawings (.dwg) from which dimensions will be extracted and converted to proper unit and will be used for calculation. This will reduce the human intervention to a large extent, thus minimizing the errors. The proposed model will estimate the amount of material used during construction such as sand, cement, concrete, bricks and all other materials and also will calculate real time cost, i.e. the total cost required to be spent on the material. Also the model will have a live database that will take input from the user, the real time costing of the material. The algorithm used will calculate material estimation and also the total cost for the materials, based on the dimensions extracted and quantities estimated. Hence the proposed model can help to eliminate human error while calculating estimates and can be used by a Contractor or a Builder to calculate total estimated cost and present it in the form of a detailed report which can be used for tendering purpose and negotiating a fruitful contract.","","978-1-5386-1185-2","10.1109/ICSCET.2018.8537348","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8537348","Quantity survey;estimation;costing;AutoCAD;Construction;Smart application;Smart City;Cost estimation;Material estimation;Total estimation;Automatic calculations","Estimation;Software;Databases;Buildings;Real-time systems;Cost accounting","architectural CAD;cements (building materials);concrete;construction industry;contracts;costing;Internet;project management;sand;tendering","smart web application;quantity survey;construction project;human error;material estimation;construction budget;planning;intelligent system;AutoCAD drawings;error minimisation;sand;cement;concrete;bricks;real time costing;tendering;contract;algorithm","","","","7","","18 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One is implemented in the selection of participants and the other is implemented in data quality assessment. Second, consensus mechanism and smart contracts are redesigned to be suitable for crowdsensing. The lightweight consensus mechanism delegated proof of reputation (DPoR) is proposed in the blockchain-based model instead of proof of work (PoW). Furthermore, three smart contracts, verifiers selection contract (VSC), participants employment contract (PEC), and data verify contract (DVC), are generated to constrain the behaviors of the involved parties.

In order to model this data transaction among mobile users, which can be realized with assistance of current mobile social platforms, we introduce an auction-based contract mechanism, and then we further analyze the system performance. To improve the efficiency and performance of the system, a socially-aware mobility model is also designed. In this model, betweenness of the data auctioneers is introduced, according to which the number of data requesters in different auctions can be balanced and the performance of the system can be optimized. The proposed data transaction mechanisms and friendship-aware mobility model are then simulated as operating on Flickr, a real-world online social network database.

Since they are highly vulnerable to different forms of attacks, their security becomes a top priority. However, existing security auditing techniques are either limited in finding vulnerabilities (rely on pre-defined bug patterns) or very expensive (rely on program analysis), thus are insufficient for Ethereum. To mitigate these limitations, we proposed a novel semantic-aware security auditing technique called S-GRAM for Ethereum. The key insight is a combination of N-gram language modeling and lightweight static semantic labeling, which can learn statistical regularities of contract tokens and capture high-level semantics as well (e.g., flow sensitivity of a transaction). S-GRAM can be used to predict potential vulnerabilities by identifying irregular token sequences and optimize existing in-depth analyzers (e.g., symbolic execution engines, fuzzers etc.). We have implemented S-GRAM for Solidity smart contracts in Ethereum. The evaluation demonstrated the potential of S-GRAM in identifying possible security issues.","2643-1572","978-1-4503-5937-5","10.1145/3238147.3240728","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9000031","Smart contracts;security auditing;language modeling;static semantic labeling","","auditing;distributed processing;electronic money;program debugging;program diagnostics;security of data","pre-defined bug patterns;program analysis;N-gram language modeling;lightweight static semantic labeling;contract tokens;S-GRAM;Solidity smart contracts;S-gram;Ethereum smart contracts;Ethereum blockchain;security auditing techniques;semantic-aware security auditing","","10","","23","","17 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To defend against these possible attacks, numerous cryptography-based authentication schemes have been proposed for the smart grid. Most of the schemes investigate the secret key distribution problem, but the requirement of decentralized registration authority is neglected. In addition, over-complicated cryptographic primitives also strengthen the burden of authentication system. In contrast with previous researches, our proposed BlockSLAP utilizes cutting-edge blockchain technology as well as smart contract to decentralize the registration authority and reduce the interaction process to 2 steps.

As a common interaction, an organization provides a service to a user who owns a certain role that was issued by a different organization. Such trans-organizational RBAC is common in face-toface communication but not in a computer network, because it is difficult to establish both the security that prohibits the malicious impersonation of roles and the flexibility that allows small organizations to participate and users to fully control their own roles. In this paper, we present an RBAC using smart contract (RBAC-SC), a platform that makes use of Ethereum's smart contract technology to realize a trans organizational utilization of roles. Ethereum is an open blockchain platform that is designed to be secure, adaptable, and flexible. It pioneered smart contracts, which are decentralized applications that serve as “autonomous agents”running exactly as programmed and are deployed on a blockchain. The RBAC-SC uses smart contracts and blockchain technology as versatile infrastructures to represent the trust and endorsement relationship that are essential in the RBAC and to realize a challenge-response authentication protocol that verifies a user's ownership of roles. We describe the RBAC-SC framework, which is composed of two main parts, namely, the smart contract and the challenge-response protocol, and present a performance analysis.

For an accurate identification of the spectral opportunities, the mobile network has to deploy multiple sensors or it can offload this task to nearby nodes with sensing capabilities, so called helpers. Unfortunately, incentives are limited for helpers to perform energy-wasteful spectrum sensing. Instead, we envision spectrum sensing as a service (Spass) in which a smart contract running on a blockchain (BC) describes the required sensing service parameters and the contracted helpers receive payments only if they perform sensing accurately as agreed in the contract. In this paper, we first introduce Spass and derive a closed formula defining the profitability of a Spass-based business as a function of the spectral efficiency, cost of helpers, and cost of the service. Moreover, we propose two-threshold based voting (TTBV) algorithm to ensure that the fraudulent helpers are excluded from Spass. Via numerical analysis, we show that TTBV causes almost zero false alarms and can exclude malicious users from the contract after only a few iterations. Finally, we develop a running prototype of Spass on Ethereum BC and share the related source code on a publicly-available repository.","2334-3125","978-1-5386-5191-9","10.1109/DySPAN.2018.8610483","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8610483","","Sensors;Smart contracts;Task analysis;Blockchain;Dynamic spectrum access","cognitive radio;contracts;radio spectrum management;signal detection","spectral efficiency;Spass-based business;required sensing service parameters;energy-wasteful spectrum sensing;sensing capabilities;nearby nodes;multiple sensors;spectral opportunities;primary users;spatiotemporally unused spectrum;licensed spectrum;mobile network operators;smart contract","","12","","20","","13 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Secure Electricity Trading and Incentive Contract Model for Electric Vehicle Based on Energy Blockchain","X. Chen; X.

On the one hand, EV can relieve the peak load of a smart grid and improve the electricity system operation. On the other hand, EV's electricity trading information can provide useful data for vehicle management departments to electricity scheduling. However, hackers can easily obtain data from the central database to simulate both parties involved, which leads to the receiver getting unauthorized information. For these challenges, we propose a novel secure electricity trading and incentive contract model based on the basic rules of China's electricity market. The digital signature technology adopts elliptic curve bilinear pairing to guarantee the reliability and integrity of the transaction information. Energy blockchain is utilized for encryption and distributed storage of energy data with the possession of tamper-proof and traceability. The consistency part of the data block applies a practical Byzantine fault-tolerant (PBFT) algorithm, which not only increases transaction throughput but also reduces transmission delay. The incentive contract based on revenue rewards can promote the benign interaction of EVs. The security analysis reveals that this scheme can achieve better results. Compared with other schemes, our scheme saves about 64.55% of the communication overhead and validates the same number of signed messages in a shorter time. Incentive contracts based on game theory can facilitate EV electricity trading through energy coin rewards. This mechanism makes EV more willing and active to participate in transactions that guarantee the activity and stability of the network.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2958122","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61763017,51665019); Scientific Research Plan Projects of Jiangxi Education Department(grant numbers:GJJ150621); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province(grant numbers:20161BAB202053,20161BAB206145); Innovation Fund for Graduate Students in Jiangxi Province(grant numbers:YC2017-S302); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8926410","Energy blockchain;electric vehicle (EV);elliptic curve encryption;game theory;incentive mechanism;security analysis","Contracts;Elliptic curves;Privacy;Smart grids;Power markets","contracts;cryptocurrencies;digital signatures;electric vehicles;fault tolerant computing;game theory;incentive schemes;power engineering computing;power markets;public key cryptography;smart power grids;transaction processing","incentive contract model;China's electricity market;transaction information;energy blockchain;energy data;data block;security analysis;EV electricity trading;energy coin rewards;electric vehicle;neoteric high-tech product;energy shortages;electricity system operation;vehicle management departments;electricity scheduling;unauthorized information;EV electricity trading information;Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithm;PBFT algorithm;transmission delay;elliptic curve bilinear pairing;revenue rewards;smart grid;game theory;digital signature technology","","9","","39","CCBY","6 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, deploying fixed allocation criteria in SCs does not necessarily lead to the best performance over time since the blockchain participants join and leave flexibly, and their load varies with time, making the original allocation suboptimal. Furthermore, updating the criteria manually at every variation in the blockchain jeopardizes the autonomous and independent execution promised by SCs. Thus, we propose a set of light-weight agents for SCs that are capable of optimizing the performance. We also propose using online learning SCs, empowered by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent, that leverage the chained data to continuously self-tune its allocation criteria. We show that the proposed learning-assisted method achieves superior performance on the combinatorial multi-stage allocation problem while still being executable in real-time.

In this paper, we present a framework that combines static and dynamic analysis to detect Reentrancy vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts. This framework generates an attacker contract based on the ABI specifications of smart contracts under test and analyzes the contract interaction to precisely report Reentrancy vulnerability. We conducted a preliminary evaluation of our proposed framework on 5 modified smart contracts from Etherscan and our framework was able to detect the Reentrancy vulnerability in all our modified contracts.

The interest in blockchain has been increasing since its emergence. Hyperledger Fabric is one of the permissioned blockchain frameworks. One of the characteristics of Hyperledger Fabric is it utilizes general-purpose programming languages, e.g., Go, Node.js, and Java, to implement smart contracts (called chaincode in Hyperledger Fabric). The advantages of utilizing these languages are already known to potential developers, and development tools might already exist. However, one of the disadvantages is that these languages were not originally designed for writing smart contracts. Hence, there may be risks that developers do not need to consider when using specific languages such as Solidity of Ethereum. Furthermore, even though development tools exist, how many risks are covered by the tools is an open question. In this paper, we focus on Go language and the tools. First, we surveyed what kind of risks are associated with chaincodes are developed using Go language and observed there are 14 potential risks. Then, we investigated how many risks can be covered by Go tools, e.g., golint and gosec, and a vulnerability detection tool for chaincodes called Chaincode Scanner. From our results, we observed that some risks are not covered by the existing tools. Hence, we develop a detection tool to cover risks by static analysis. Finally, in this paper, we describe how to find the risks with our tool and evaluate the usefulness.","","978-1-7281-1807-9","10.1109/IWBOSE.2019.8666486","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8666486","Smart Contract;Validation Tool;Blockchain;Hyperledger Fabric","Blockchain;Fabrics;Smart contracts;Tools;Proposals;DSL;Computer languages","data privacy;electronic money;Java;program diagnostics;risk management;security of data;software tools;specification languages","Ethereum;vulnerability detection tool;hyperledger fabric smart contracts;decentralized ledger technology;permissioned blockchain frameworks;Bitcoin;Go tools;Chaincode Scanner","","16","","28","","14 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Similar to centralised mobile crowd services, such as mobile crowdsensing, incentivisation mechanisms are core to encouraging mobile users to participate in MPCS systems. However, due to the impact of task execution failures and unreliable behaviours of mobile users (particularly task requesters), it is a daunting task to design and implement an incentivisation mechanism to cater for the needs of MPCS systems. In this paper, we propose a fault-tolerant incentivisation mechanism (FTIM) for MPCS systems. With conditional payment strategies, FTIM is proven to accommodate the requirements of two important application scenarios by achieving mechanism properties such as incentive compatibility, economic efficiency, individual rationality, and weak budget balance. Moreover, to tackle the practical challenges in implementing FTIM in the real world, we design a MPCSTo-ken smart contract to facilitate its service auction, task execution and payment settlement process. We implement the MPCSToken contract on Ethereum blockchain.

The proposed scheme recognizes the different characteristics of curtailment, such as the total length of curtailments within a window of time, or the number of separate curtailment events (i.e., curtailment startup), and compensates the end-user accordingly. The proposed compensation scheme features a piece-wise reward function comprised of two intervals. DR participants receive a onetime reward upfront when they enroll in the DR program and accept a set of predefined curtailment aspects. Curtailment aspects in excess of the agreed quantities are rewarded at a linear rate. This design is tailored to appeal to residential DR participants, and aims to secure sufficient flexibility at minimum cost. The parameters of the smart contract are optimized such that the system's social welfare is maximized. The optimization problem is modeled as a mixed-integer linear program. Consequently, this article updates the unit-commitment (UC) formulation with the commitment aspects of DR units. The proposed extension to the UC problem considers the critical aspects of DR participation, such as: the total length of interruptions within a window, the frequency of interruptions within a time-window irrespective of their length, and the net energy deviation from the original load profile. Deployment of the smart DR contract in the unit dispatch problem requires translating DR participants' characteristics to their equivalent aspects in conventional thermal generators, such as minimum up time, minimum down-time, start-up and shutdown costs. The obtained results demonstrate significant improvement in social welfare, notable reduction of curtailed renewable energy and reduction in extreme ramping events of conventional generators.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2020.3042847","Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, UAE(grant numbers:CIRA-2018-37); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9284501","Demand response;incentive based;detailed DR model;activation frequency;number of activations;settlement window;smart DR contracts","Contracts;Generators;Load modeling;Time-frequency analysis;Smart grids;Renewable energy sources;Pricing","demand side management;electrical contracting;incentive schemes;integer programming;optimisation;piecewise linear techniques;power generation dispatch;power generation economics;power generation scheduling;renewable energy sources","conventional thermal generators;load profile;renewable energy;net energy deviation;time-window;social welfare;unit dispatch problem;smart DR contract;unit-commitment formulation;mixed-integer linear program;optimization problem;piece-wise reward function;compensation scheme;power system flexibility enhancement;incentive based demand response program","","1","","21","CCBY","7 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The payment channel increases the transaction throughput of two parties to a level that is only limited by their network bandwidth. Recent proposals focus on extending the two-party payment channel to the N-party payment hub. Unfortunately, none of them can achieve efficiency, flexibility in the absence of a trusted third-party. In this paper, we propose Garou, a secure N-party payment hub that allows multiple parties to perform secure off-chain coin transfers. Except in the case of disputes, participants within the payment hub can make concurrent and direct coin transfers with each other without the involvement of the blockchain or any third-party intermediaries. This allows Garou to achieve both high-performance and flexibility. If all participants keep online, Garou guarantees all honest users’ balance security against strong adversarial capabilities. To demonstrate the feasibility of the Garou protocol, we develop a proof of concept prototype for the Ethereum network. Experimental evaluations show that, with 300 participants and without disputes, that the maximum transaction throughput of Garou is 20× higher than that of state-of-the-art payment hubs.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2021.3101808","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1711263, U1811461, U1801266); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018B030312002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9504436","Off-chain protocol;payment hub;smart contract;scalability;concurrency.","Blockchains;Scalability;Throughput;Bitcoin;Smart contracts;Servers;Concurrent computing","","","","","","","IEEE","2 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

We conclude that Gaussian Mixture Models are appropriate for distributions of smart contracts with respect to Used Gas and Gas Price, and use a uniform distribution for the distribution with respect to the Gas Limit. A correlation analysis shows that the CPU Time is strongly correlated with Used Gas and we therefore apply regression techniques to estimate the CPU Time conditioned on Used Gas.

In this work, we propose to use blockchain technologies and smart contracts to orchestrate the interactions between mobile crowdsensing providers and mobile users for the case of spatial crowdsensing, where mobile users need to be at specific locations to perform the tasks. Smart contracts, by operating as processes that are executed on the blockchain, are used to preserve users' privacy and make payments. Furthermore, for the assignment of the crowdsensing tasks to the mobile users, we design a truthful, cost-optimal auction that minimizes the payments from the crowdsensing providers to the mobile users.

To solve the above challenges, we propose a consortium blockchain for secure resource sharing in VEC. We first design multi-step smart contracts to achieve secure resource sharing and defend against the malicious behaviours of service requesters and vehicles with selfish purposes. Then, a byzantine fault tolerance-based proof-of-stake (BFT-based PoS) consensus protocol is applied in consortium blockchain to reach consensus efficiently. Furthermore, we design a contract-based incentive mechanism to motivate vehicles to share their computation resources with service requesters. The optimal contracts are derived to maximize the service requesters' expected utility as well as social welfare. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed incentive mechanism is more effective and efficient than the traditional schemes.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2020.3004475","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971148); Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi Province(grant numbers:2018GXNSFDA281013); Foundation for Science and Technology Project of Guilin City(grant numbers:20190214-3); Marie Sklodowska-Curie(grant numbers:824019); Sichuan Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:2019YFH0033); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9123565","Consortium blockchain;contract-based incentive mechanism;resource sharing;vehicular edge computing.","Blockchain;Resource management;Task analysis;Edge computing;Delays;Security;Contracts","blockchains;contracts;distributed processing;fault tolerant computing;pedestrians;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;vehicular ad hoc networks","vehicular edge computing;VEC;vehicular networks;computation resources;potential security issues;consortium blockchain;secure resource sharing;design multistep smart contracts;service requesters;contract based incentive mechanism;contract based approach;byzantine fault tolerance based proof of stake","","4","","36","IEEE","23 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper proposes a two-layer secured smart contract-based energy trading mechanism to allow microgrids to establish coalitions, adjust the electricity-trading price, and achieve transparent and decentralized secure transactions without intervention of a third trusted party. Since reliability benefits are main drivers of microgrids operation in islanded mode, a new decentralized smart contract based-energy trading model for islanded networked microgrids is proposed in the first layer with an objective to achieve demand generation balance. In the second layer, and to achieve a higher security, all executed contracts are verified and saved in a blockchain based on a new developed two-phase consensus method that utilizes practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT), and a modified Proof of Stake (PoS).

Assessing the quality of Smart Contract programs is an important task required to professional programmers, especially when a programming language has so powerful economic implications. It is therefore crucial to provide professional programmers with tools for the evaluation of Smart Contracts. In software engineering, software metrics has been defined and used to measure software quality and, more in general, to qualify software under the principle “You Can't Manage What You Don't Measure”. For the Solidity programming language there are only a few Standalone Applications to analyse the Smart Contract metrics. The aim of this paper is first to build a tool for the practical computation of a specific set of Solidity source code metrics, so that the set will be extensible in the future according also to Solidity compiler evolution, second to fully enable a web-based usage of the tool to access the metrics of the Solidity programming language.

A group of mobile users are recruited with their smart devices to accomplish various sensing tasks in specific areas. The mobility and intelligence of mobile users enable MCS to achieve a sufficient coverage ratio of sensing tasks or areas. Currently, MCS is generally proposed and implemented in a centralized way under a platform’s control. However, this centralized structure is vulnerable to a single point of failure. The platform’s failure leads to a shutdown of the entire system. In addition, there is a trust issue between the platform and mobile users because of computational transparency and financial security. It is possible that the platform manipulates the working process of MCS to obtain an improper gain. To overcome these problems, we propose a decentralized MCS framework named ChainSensing by leveraging blockchain. In ChainSensing, mobile users interact with blockchain via smart contracts to complete their operations, e.g., publishing sensing tasks and submitting collected data. Since there are computationally intensive problems in ChainSensing, e.g., path planning, path selection, and reward determination, it is significantly expensive to solve such problems in blockchain. Therefore, we propose to leverage smart devices and computing oracles to solve these problems. Specifically, we propose a heuristic algorithm to solve the path planning problem in smart devices of mobile users; we employ computing oracles to solve the path selection and reward determination problems. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations based on Ethereum to evaluate the performance of ChainSensing.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3094670","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9474463","Mobile crowdsensing;decentralized framework;blockchain;smart contract.","Task analysis;Sensors;Blockchain;Smart contracts;Internet of Things;Crowdsensing;Smart devices","","","","","","","IEEE","5 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The explosive increase in the number of vehicles has substantially raised the issue of finding a suitable parking spot, which is both time and resource consuming. At the same time, many private parking spots remain idle, while their owners are not present at home. To promote the utility of private parking spots and mitigate parking issues, smart parking apps can be used. Unfortunately, some of them suffer from privacy issues that affect participation willingness, while others work in a centralized environment where the availability of service is not guaranteed in the presence of malicious users. In this work, we propose Blockchain-based Smart parking with Fairness, reliability and Privacy protection, called BSFP. Specifically, group signatures, bloom filters, and vector-based encryption are leveraged to protect the user's privacy. The decentralized nature of blockchain is utilized to achieve reliability in smart parking, and the smart contract is used to realize fairness.

In this paper, we leverage the blockchain and smart contracts to build a decentralized charging coordination mechanism without the need for a centralized charging coordinator. First ESUs should use tokens for anonymously authenticate themselves to the blockchain. Then each ESU sends a charging request that contains its State-of-Charge (SoC), Time-to-complete-charge (TCC) and amount of required charging to the smart contract address on the blockchain. The smart contract will then run the charging coordination mechanism in a self-executed manner such that ESUs with the highest priorities are charged in the present time slot while charging requests of lower priority ESUs are deferred to future time slots. In this way, each ESU can make sure that charging schedules are computed correctly. Finally, we have implemented the proposed mechanism on the Ethereum test-bed blockchain, and our analysis shows that execution cost can be acceptable in terms of gas consumption while enabling decentralized charging coordination with increased transparency, reliability, and privacy preserving.","","978-1-7281-4693-5","10.1109/Blockchain.2019.00076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8946265","Blockchain;charging;Smart grid;Decentralized system;Privacy-preservation;Energy storage units","Blockchain;Smart contracts;Schedules;Batteries;Load modeling;Privacy","cryptocurrencies;cryptography;demand side management;distributed databases;energy storage;power system reliability;smart power grids","decentralized charging coordination mechanism;ESU;state-of-charge;Ethereum test-bed blockchain;smart grid energy storage;energy storage units;smart grid resilience;effective demand response;uncoordinated charging;power system;blockchain-based charging coordination mechanism;smart contract;centralized charging coordination mechanism;SoC;time-to-complete-charge;TCC;gas consumption;reliability","","11","","28","","2 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the existence of Byzantine nodes, existing mature concurrency control protocols in database cannot be employed directly, since the mechanism of executing smart contracts varies a lot. Furthermore, even though smart contract execution follows a two-phase style, i.e., the primary node executes a batch of smart contracts in the first phase and the validators replay them in the second phase, existing parallel solutions merely focus on the optimization for the first phase, rather than the second phase. In this paper, we propose a novel two-phase concurrency control protocol to optimize both phases for the first time. First, the primary executes transactions in parallel and generates a transaction dependency graph with high parallelism for validators. Then, a graph partition algorithm is devised to divide the original graph into several sub-graphs to preserve parallelism and reduce communication cost remarkably. Finally, we propose a deterministic replay protocol to re-execute the primary's parallel schedule concurrently. Moreover, this two-phase protocol is further optimized by integrating with PBFT. Theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results illustrate that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-art solutions significantly.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2021.3059959","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9356389","Blockchain;Smart Contract;Concurrency","Smart contracts;Blockchain;Concurrency control;Concurrent computing;Schedules;Parallel processing;Throughput","","","","","","","IEEE","17 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Then, we take combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) system as an example that supplies distributed energy, and model its interactions with the agent of power grid by a novel Stackelberg game. We show that the optimal utilities of entities in a city can be obtained at the Stackelberg equilibrium by a distributed algorithm, which is guaranteed to exist and be unique.

By enabling parallel confirmations of transactions, sharding has been proposed to mitigate these drawbacks, which usually requires frequent communication among miners through a separate consensus protocol.In this paper, we propose, analyze, and implement a new distributed and dynamic sharding system to substantially improve the throughput of blockchain systems based on smart contracts, while requiring minimum cross-shard communication. Our key observation is that transactions sent by users who only participate in a single smart contract can be validated and confirmed independently without causing double spending. Therefore, the natural formation of a shard is to surround one smart contract to start with. The complication lies in the different sizes of shards being formed, in which a small shard with few transactions tends to generate a large number of empty blocks resulting in a waste of mining power, while a large shard adversely affects parallel confirmations. To overcome this problem, we propose an inter-shard merging algorithm with incentives to encourage small shards to merge with one another and form a larger shard, an intra-shard transaction selection mechanism to encourage miners to select different subsets of transactions for validation, as well as a parameter unification method to further improve these two algorithms to reduce the communication cost and improve system reliability.We analyze our proposed algorithms using the game theoretic approach, and prove that they converge to a Nash Equilibrium. We also present a security analysis on our sharding design, and prove that it resists adversaries who occupy at most 33% of the computation power. We have implemented our designs on go-Ethereum 1.8.0 and evaluated their performance using both real-world blockchain transactions and large-scale simulations.

For the duration of the LT contract, short-term (ST) modules are running on daily basis.

A key issue in such schemes is the design and analysis of energy trading techniques involving complex interactions between an aggregator and multiple electricity suppliers (ESs) with RESs fulfilling a certain demand. This is challenging because ESs can be of various categories, such as small/medium/large scale, and they are self-interested and generally have different preferences toward trading based on their types and constraints. This article introduces a new contract theoretic framework to tackle this challenge by designing optimal contracts for ESs. To this end, a dynamic pricing scheme is developed such that the aggregator can utilize to incentivize the ESs to contribute to both baseload and peak load demands according to their categories. An algorithm is proposed that can be implemented in a distributed manner by trading partners to enable energy trading. It is shown that the trading strategy under a baseload scenario is feasible, and the aggregator only needs to consider the per unit generation cost of ESs to decide on its strategy. The trading strategy for a peak load scenario, however, is complex and requires consideration of different factors, such as variations in the wholesale price and its effect on the selling price of ESs, and the uncertainty of energy generation from RESs. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme for energy trading in the local electricity market.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2020.3018123","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9174851","Contract theory;electricity suppliers (ESs);energy trading;microgrid;renewable energy (RE)","Contracts;Power markets;Power grids;Load modeling;Renewable energy sources;Pricing","contracts;demand side management;distributed power generation;load (electric);power generation economics;power markets;pricing;renewable energy sources;smart power grids","optimal contracts;dynamic pricing scheme;aggregator;baseload scenario;local electricity market;renewable energy sources;energy trading techniques;multiple electricity suppliers;smart grid technology;RES;power sector;peak load demand;per unit generation cost;wholesale price;selling price","","","","40","IEEE","24 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the increasing number of mobile users, how to develop an effective scheme to provide the high-quality and secure sensing data becomes a new challenge. In this paper, we propose a contract theory based scheme to provide sensing service in MCSNs. At first, with the analysis of the interaction experience between the crowd sensing platform and mobile user, a trust scheme is introduced to guarantee the quality of sensing data by considering the direct trust and indirect trust. Next, according to the transaction between crowd sensing platform and mobile user, an optimal contract based on incentive scheme is designed to stimulate mobile users to participate in crowd sensing network, where the contract item can not only maximize the platform utility, but also satisfy individual rationality and incentive compatibility. Finally, the numerical results show that the proposal outperforms the conventional schemes.","","978-1-5386-4248-1","10.1109/MoWNet.2018.8428903","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8428903","Mobile crowd sensing;trust scheme;optimal contract","Sensors;Contracts;Task analysis;Conferences;Big Data;Edge computing;Smart cities","contracts;mobile computing;security of data;sensor fusion;trusted computing","secure sensing data;sensing service;crowd sensing platform;mobile user;trust scheme;crowd sensing network;mobile crowd sensing networks;incentive compatibility;sensing data quality;contract theory based incentive scheme;MCSN","","3","","24","","9 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using this technology to store important documents of an individual makes the documents more secured and they cannot be tampered once uploaded and the individual can have the advantage of accessing their documents anytime without the need of middle men. Smart contracts are used to exchange data in a transparent and in a trusted manner. Documents of the users are converted into e-docs along with a unique quick response code. Each individual's code forms a block with a specific hashed value and helps in forming a continuous blocks. These blocks cannot be altered once formed and hence it is not possible to retrieve the documents unless the user's permission. It is secured using the user's fingerprint which is dissolved into text using steganography. Thus the documents are kept secure and can be used whenever needed without any constraints and can also be never tampered or manipulated.","","978-1-5386-4765-3","10.1109/CESYS.2018.8724054","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8724054","Blockchain;Smart contracts;Steganography;Decentralized;Quick response code","Blockchain;Peer-to-peer computing;Databases;Fingerprint recognition;Documentation;Conferences;Computer science","contracts;cryptography;distributed databases;information retrieval;Internet;storage management;text analysis;trusted computing","trusted manner;e-docs;unique quick response code;blockchain;E-DOC Wallet;data exchange;smart contracts;document retrieval;steganography","","","","15","","30 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Along with it being highly network intensive, data owners are also reluctant to provide their data due to security and privacy breaches. In order to overcome these issues, we proposed TOTEM: Token for controlled computation, that combines both blockchain technologies and big data systems. The objective is to allow computation to be taken to the data, rather than moving the data to the computation. A third-party user uses the TOTEM SDK to create a MapReduce code for computation, which will be executed within the data owner's environment. This computational system prevents the execution of any malicious functions in the user code, by putting constraints on computational operations. A pre-defined totem will be assigned to authorised users, based on their computational needs. A smart contract performs pre-checks on user-submitted code and associated totem value, by using a totem estimator to determine the required totem for executing the given code. A Totem manager and updater is introduced to coordinate computation of user code until it exits gracefully, or the assigned totem gets exhausted. The TOTEM project ensures data security by allowing organisations to open their data centers and allow disruptive business models.","","978-1-5386-5906-9","10.1109/ICCCNT45670.2019.8944855","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8944855","Blockchain;Smart contracts;Big Data System;Hyperledger Fabric;Ethereum-gas;Apache Hadoop","Blockchain;Big Data;Smart contracts;Distributed ledger;Computer architecture;Peer-to-peer computing;Security","authorisation;Big Data;cloud computing;contracts;data analysis;data privacy;parallel processing","data security;data centers;token;TOTEM project;assigned totem;updater;required totem;totem estimator;associated totem value;user-submitted code;smart contract performs pre-checks;authorised users;pre-defined totem;computational operations;user code;computational system;data owner;MapReduce code;TOTEM SDK;third-party user;big data systems;blockchain technologies;privacy breaches;data owners;highly network intensive;data analysis;controlled computation","","1","","24","","30 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to analyse such ever-growing amount of data, this paper argues that blockchain analysis should be treated as a novel type of application for Big Data platforms. In this paper we explore the application of parallelization techniques from the Big Data domain, in particular Map/Reduce, to extract and analyse information from the blockchain. We show that our approach significantly improves the index generation by 7.77 times, with a setup of 20 worker nodes, 1 Ethereum node and 1 Database node. We also share our findings of our massively parallel setup for querying Ethereum in terms of architecture and the bottlenecks.

Most of those attacks were made through smart contracts - pieces of code through which blockchain users interact with the actual blockchain. This paper analyses the background of blockchain technology, the implementation of smart contracts, and the cybersecurity aspect in the blockchain field.

Also, the existing PHR systems are centralized and vulnerable to the single point of failure problem. Integrating PHR systems with blockchain technology can help to overcome such limitations. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based PHR architecture that employs smart contracts to implement multi-party authorization (MPA) and threshold cryptographic schemes to automate secure and trustable medical data sharing and access in PHR systems. Moreover, we mitigate the limited storage and computation capabilities of blockchain by using InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) storage and reputation-governed trusted oracles into the proposed architecture. MPA and threshold cryptographic schemes allow the patient to split and share a secret key with a set of trusted parties, such as the healthcare regulatory agency, guardians, and hospitals, in such a way that they can collectively decide on sharing medical data on behalf of patients.

Centralized platforms always face following challenges: 1) How to ensure the rationality of tasks allocating; 2) How to ensure the payments of workers in the system when dishonest requesters exist; 3) How to ensure the maximum number of tasks are assigned. 4) How to ensure the integrity and reliability of the centralized platform. To solve these problems, this article proposed a distributed blockchain-based crowdsourcing framework - TSWCrowd (Task Select Worker Crowd). In this framework, tasks are sorted according to specific rules, thus tasks with higher priority are assigned to workers earlier. Workers who are available for a task will be selected and return a result. Then the deployed smart contracts will pay the basic payment automatically. At the same time, relevant contracts also calculate and pay the quality payment according to the proposed quality reward formulation. The proposed TSWCrowd framework on-chain involves a public dataset and uses solidity to compile the smart contracts. The framework was deployed on a local private blockchain. The decentralization property of the blockchain ensures the reliable assignment of tasks. Task-select-worker (TSW) algorithm sorts tasks to ensure reliability. In this paper, the proposed framework was compared with the ABCrowd auction mechanism on-chain and the VCG mechanism off-chain. The results show that the average distance is shorter and the payment is higher, thus reaches the reasonability, reliability and availability.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3043040","National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61572325,60970012); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9285251","Blockchain;crowdsourcing;smart contracts;task management","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Blockchain;Resource management;Reliability;Privacy;Smart contracts","contracts;crowdsourcing;data privacy;sorting","smart contracts;quality payment;TSWCrowd framework;local private blockchain;reliable assignment;spatial crowdsourcing;centralized platform;decentralized task-select-worker framework;task select worker crowd;VCG mechanism;distributed blockchain-based crowdsourcing framework","","1","","39","CCBY","7 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we investigate smart contracts for wallets with regard to the functionality that makes use of cryptographically secured blockchain technology. We focus on wallet contracts deployed on Ethereum, as it is the most prominent platform for tokens and smart contracts with readily available data. We aim at a better understanding of this frequently deployed group of smart contracts by analyzing characteristics of wallet contracts and grouping them into six types. To this end, we present approaches to identify wallet contracts by analyzing source code, bytecode, and execution traces extracted from transaction data. Moreover, we investigate usage scenarios and patterns. From the derived data, we extract blueprints for wallets and compile a ground truth. We provide numbers and temporal perspectives regarding the creation and use of wallets.","","978-1-7281-7091-6","10.1109/BRAINS49436.2020.9223287","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9223287","analysis;EVM bytecode;smart contract;transaction data;wallet","","cryptocurrencies;transaction processing","blockchain wallets;core program code off-chain;smart contracts;wallet contracts;software wallet;secured blockchain technology","","","","47","","14 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

How to scale up the applications with assured security becomes a critical challenge. Blockchain technology (BCT) is a promising solution to provide security and protect privacy in a large scale; especially, smart contracts offer opportunities to improve the reliability of IoT applications. Smart contracts establish trusts for both of data and executed processes. Recently, many literature surveys and positioning articles have been published on the integration of BCT with IoT, but they are limited to superficial discussions of technical potentials, and very few of them have a thorough exploration of the challenges in developing BCT for IoT at technical levels. This paper uses the system design approach to scrutinize the state of the art of study on BCT-based applications and clarify critical research areas of enabling BCT for security assurance: 1) the relations of BCT and IoT are modeled and discussed; 2) the needs of eliminating threats in IoT-based applications are defined as functional requirements (FRs), existing works on enabling technologies of BCT are defined as the physical solutions (PSs); and 3) the mappings between FRs and PSs are established to identify the limitations and the critical areas for the applications of BCT in large-scale distributed environment.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2925825","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8752029","Axiomatic design theory (ADT);blockchain technologies (BCT);Internet of Things (IoT);literature review;security assurance;service-oriented architecture (SoA);smart contract","Internet of Things;Smart contracts;Blockchain;Computer crime;System analysis and design;Privacy","computer network security;contracts;data privacy;Internet of Things;security of data","blockchain technology;smart contracts;system design approach;BCT-based applications;IoT-based applications;physical solutions;system design perspective;physical devices;virtual world;IoT applications centralize security assurance;delating system components;assured security;Internet of Things-mapping;functional requirements;large-scale distributed environment","","16","","80","IEEE","1 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, a user that is capable of contributing to CCDMI might act selfishly and refuse to participate. Although the operator can encourage user participation by offering incentives, it has incomplete information about the users' willingness to participate. In order to overcome this problem of adverse selection in CCDMI, we propose two contract-based methods under information asymmetry. In both methods, the operator designs a performance-based contract set for the users that are capable of local content distribution. Using a mathematical analysis, we show that the optimal contract under information asymmetry achieves close to optimal utility for the users and the operator, compared with the information symmetry case. Moreover, the users with high willingness to participate get positive utility and the users with low willingness get zero utility. Hence, by assigning contracts, the operator can motivate user participation, despite the information asymmetry between them.

To address that, in this paper a blockchain based secure computation offloading scheduling scheme is proposed. It embraces the blockchain based trust management paradigm and smart contract enabled Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm. As for the trust management, the long-term reputation and short-term trust variability are jointly considered. Specifically, a novel three-valued subjective logic (3VSL) scheme is adopted to obtain a more comprehensive reputation, and the statistics of behavioral transitions can provide a short-term trust variability to timely capture the malicious behaviors. In addition, to securely update, validate, and store the trust information, we propose a hierarchical blockchain framework that comprises vehicular blockchain, RSU blockchain, and cloud blockchain. Furthermore, a smart contract enabled DRL algorithm is proposed to implement the secure and intelligent computation offloading scheduling in a VCN.

All transactions for communication and data storage are public and can be verified by all participants. DApps interacting with a smart contract typically require client-side code, which is not part of the smart contract, and therefore do not hold the same verifiability properties. Following the vision of a verifiable DApp, we propose SmartDHX, a Diffie-Hellman key exchange (DHKE) scheme, fully implemented as a smart contract. That is, SmartDHX communicates only via the Ethereum blockchain and provides both backend and client-side code with the smart contract. The application code can therefore be verified and deployed without external trust requirements. By executing DHKE on-chain, we gain a number of properties, including asynchronicity as well as message integrity and authenticity. We generalize the two-party SmartDHX to emphasize that our approach is able to handle complex cryptographic protocols. In our analysis, we expose an efficiency tradeoff when executed on chain. In particular, we provide a proof-of-concept implementation and analyze the runtime and transaction fees. Since DHKE is used by many cryptographic algorithms, SmartDHX contributes a fundamental building block in the domain of DApps.","","978-1-7281-6978-1","10.1109/DAPPS49028.2020.00022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9126004","Key Exchange;Decentralized Application;Smart Contract;Blockchain;Diffie-Hellman","","cryptocurrencies;cryptographic protocols;public key cryptography;telecommunication security","smart contract;client-side code;verifiability properties;verifiable DApp;Diffie-Hellman key exchange scheme;decentralized applications;DHKE on-chain;Ethereum blockchain;message integrity;two-party SmartDHX;backend code;cryptographic protocols","","1","","13","","8 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the most widely used execution engines is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). EVM performance is a key determinant of the overall blockchain system. Being able to gather detailed insights into EVM performance characteristics is essential not only when implementing EVMs, but also when designing and dimensioning blockchain-based information systems. Today, there is no precise and easy-to-use solution to gather such information. To address this issue, we introduce EVM-Perf, a high-precision EVM evaluation, and analysis framework. Our framework allows detailed performance analysis of arbitrary EVM implementations. Unlike previous work, it leverages statical analysis methods to achieve higher levels of accuracy. We provide an open-source implementation of EVM-Perf and use it to conduct extensive performance analysis for different physical machines. It comprises both machines with x86_64 as well as ARMv8 instruction set architecture. We discuss how EVM-Perf supports system architects with machine selection as well as configurations of Ethereum deployments, e.g., determining Gas limits or block intervals.","","978-1-6654-3578-9","10.1109/ICBC51069.2021.9461058","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9461058","Blockchain;Performance Analysis;Microbench-marking;Ethereum;EVM","Instruction sets;Conferences;Smart contracts;Blockchain;Virtual machining;Performance analysis;Cryptocurrency","blockchains;contracts;information systems;instruction sets;microprocessor chips;parallel architectures;software performance evaluation;transaction processing;virtual machines","EVM-Perf;high-precision EVM performance;smart contract execution engines;implementing EVMs;blockchain-based information systems;high-precision EVM evaluation;blockchain transaction processing;Ethereum virtual machine;machine selection;ARMv8 instruction set architecture;system architects","","","","13","","24 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A pressing need is to develop an efficient Energy Management Model (EMM) that integrates renewable energy sources with smart grids. However, the variable scenarios and constraints make this a complex problem. Machine Learning (ML) methods can often model complex and non-linear data better than the statistical models. Therefore, developing an ML algorithm for the EMM is a suitable option as it reduces the complexity of the EMM by developing a single trained model to predict the performance parameters of EMM for multiple scenarios. However, understanding latent correlations and developing trust in highly complex ML models for designing EMM within the stochastic prosumer-based smart grid is still a challenging task. Therefore, this paper integrates ML and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) in the EMM. At the first stage, an optimization model for Prosumer Energy Surplus (PES), Prosumer Energy Cost (PEC), and Grid Revenue (GR) is formulated to calculate base performance parameters (PES, PEC, and GR) for the training of the ML-based GPR model. In the second stage, stochasticity of renewable energy sources, load, and energy price, same as provided by the Genetic Algorithm (GA) based optimization model for PES, PEC, and GR, and base performance parameters act as input covariates to produce a GPR model that predicts PES, PEC, and GR. Seasonal variations of PES, PEC, and GR are incorporated to remove hitches from seasonal dynamics of prosumers energy generation and prosumers energy consumption. The proposed adaptive Service Level Agreement (SLA) between energy prosumers and the grid benefits both these entities. The results of the proposed model are rigorously compared with conventional optimization (GA and PSO) based EMM to prove the validity of the proposed model.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3029943","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9218929","Prosumer;smart grid;machine learning;energy districts;service level agreement;smart contract;optimization;Gaussian process regression;energy management model","Smart grids;Optimization;Renewable energy sources;Ground penetrating radar;Stochastic processes","distributed power generation;energy consumption;energy management systems;Gaussian processes;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;power engineering computing;pricing;regression analysis;renewable energy sources;smart power grids","prosumers energy consumption;prosumers energy generation;Genetic Algorithm based optimization model;energy price;ML-based GPR model;base performance parameters;Grid Revenue;PEC;Prosumer Energy Cost;PES;Prosumer Energy Surplus;stochastic prosumer-based smart grid;highly complex ML models;latent correlations;single trained model;ML algorithm;statistical models;EMM;efficient Energy Management Model;energy demand management;renewable energy sources;renewable Energy districts","","","","43","CCBY","9 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By leveraging the charging/discharging capabilities of EVs, V2G can be implemented in smart grid to enable intelligent energy transactions and reduce the unbalance of supply and demand. However, the implementation of interaction between the existing V2G technology and IoEVs faces the problems of high-complexity energy transaction management, insufficient computing capability, poor scalability, and lack of incentive mechanisms. The three-tier bi-directional energy transaction management strategies based on game and contract theory have been proposed. Firstly, the optimal pricing and EV discharging strategy is obtained based on the non-cooperative Stackelberg game and the energy-price equilibrium. Secondly, in order to optimize the utility of EAG, the information asymmetry incentive mechanism based on contract theory is proposed. This mechanism can effectively stimulate EVs to contribute to V2G energy transaction and further improve social benefits considering the energy transmission loss and battery life cycle degradation. To reduce the communication as well as processing latency and improve the efficiency of energy transaction management, edge computing has been incorporated.

Timely processing the large-scaled IIoT data by the conventional computation framework, such as Cloud computing, however, is nontrivial due to its costly resource usage, intolerable delay, and unbearable backbone pressures. By leveraging the idle resources of smart objects at the edge, mobile device cloud (MDC) becomes promising for the IIoT data analysis, thanks to the flexible resource provision and nearby task offloading. However, MDC workers are mostly human-carried devices with large scale, high dynamic resource provision, and untruthful behaviors, which pose significant challenges on MDC task allocation. In this article, we propose a blockchain-based decentralized and truthful framework for MDC (BC-MDC). BC-MDC enables the decentralization and prevents dishonesty by incorporating a plasma-based blockchain into the MDC. We design four smart contracts for distributedly managing the worker registration, task posting/allocation, rewarding, and penalizing. Furthermore, MDC task allocation is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem that jointly minimizes the long-term processing cost and risk of task failing. We also design a truthful reward/penalty algorithm that stimulates workers to provide resources and enforce them to keep the promise as well.

An SIoT system has to store and manage device reputation values, which are used by end devices to determine the trustworthiness of another one. This device trustworthiness can also be affected by its geographical location. In this work, we introduced an architecture that includes the geospatial context in the part concerned with reputation management. The proposed architecture is based on the cloud-fog-edge architecture and uses the fog layer as the management system. The devices in the fog layer form an Ethereum Blockchain network and store the Smart Contracts. These in turn allow the management functionalities to be carried out in a decentralised, transparent and secure way, which are the advantages of Blockchain.

Whereas immense usage of Electric Vehicles (EVs) as mobile energy carriers have supported distributed energy trading due to their bidirectional charging and discharging capabilities. The trustless environment of Internet of Electric Vehicles (IoEV), including fuel vehicles and EVs, encounters trading disputes and conflicting interests among trading parties. To address these challenges, we exploit consortium blockchain to maintain transparency and trust in trading activities. Smart contracts are used to tackle trading disputes and illegal actions. Data duplication problem occurs when a dishonest user sell previously traded data multiple times for financial gain. Therefore, data duplication validation is done through previously stored hash-list at roadside units (RSUs) employed with bloom filters for efficient data lookup. Removing data duplication at an earlier stage reduces storage cost. Moreover, an elliptic curve bilinear pairing based digital signature scheme is used to ensure the reliability and integrity of traded data. To ensure persistent availability of traded data, InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is used, which provides fault-tolerant and a reliable data storage without any single point of failure. On the other hand, the energy trading transactions among EVs face some security and privacy protection challenges. An adversary can infer the energy trading records of EVs, and launch the data linkage attacks. To address this issue, an account generation technique is used that hides the energy trading trends. The new account generation for an EV depends upon its traded volume of energy. The experimental results verify the efficiency of the proposed data and energy trading scheme in IoEV with the reliable and secure data storage.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3048169","King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, through the Researchers Supporting Project(grant numbers:RSP-2020/184); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9311120","Blockchain technology;smart contract;Internet of Electric Vehicles;data storage;data trading;IPFS;energy trading;privacy;data linkage attacks","Blockchain;Reliability;Electric vehicles;Smart contracts;Internet;Market research;Memory","battery powered vehicles;blockchains;contracts;data integrity;data protection;data structures;digital signatures;distributed power generation;electric vehicle charging;failure analysis;Internet of Things;power engineering computing;public key cryptography;security of data","blockchain based data;mobile energy carriers;fuel vehicles;data duplication validation;data linkage attacks;energy trading scheme;vehicular networks data trading;Internet of Electric Vehicles;IoEV;distributed energy trading;smart contracts;bloom filters;elliptic curve bilinear pairing based digital signature scheme;InterPlanetary file system;IPFS","","1","","73","CCBY","30 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we introduce a novel technique for targeted greybox fuzzing using an online static analysis that guides the fuzzer toward a set of target locations, for instance, located in recently modified parts of the program. This is achieved by first semantically analyzing each program path that is explored by an input in the fuzzer's test suite. The results of this analysis are then used to control the fuzzer's specialized power schedule, which determines how often to fuzz inputs from the test suite. We implemented our technique by extending a state-of-the-art, industrial fuzzer for Ethereum smart contracts and evaluate its effectiveness on 27 real-world benchmarks. Using an online analysis is particularly suitable for the domain of smart contracts since it does not require any code instrumentation-adding instrumentation to contracts changes their semantics. Our experiments show that targeted fuzzing significantly outperforms standard greybox fuzzing for reaching 83% of the challenging target locations (up to 14x of median speed-up).","1558-1225","978-1-4503-7121-6","","DFG(grant numbers:389792660); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9284040","","Instruments;Smart contracts;Computer bugs;Static analysis;Fuzzing;Benchmark testing;Standards","benchmark testing;program debugging;program diagnostics;program testing;program verification","targeted greybox fuzzing;static lookahead analysis;automatic test generation;explore new paths;bugs;program parts;offline static analysis;online static analysis;recently modified parts;program path;fuzz inputs;test suite;industrial fuzzer;Ethereum smart contracts;online analysis;targeted fuzzing;standard greybox fuzzing;challenging target locations","","","","80","","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A transaction between a seller and a purchaser is completed when the seller has agreed to exchange packaged goods for a payment from the purchaser. Building highly trustworthy, accountable, credible, and decentralized CoD systems to trace and track physical items is a very challenging task. Several technologies and models for deploying CoD-based applications have been proposed in the literature. In most scenarios, these models have been created with the aim of accommodating collaborative processes involving multiple participants, e.g. seller, purchasers, and shippers, that belong to independent organizations. However, these approaches face several limitations and require appropriate improvement to sustain CoD-based systems' adoption further. First of all, there are no incentives for participants to act honestly. Secondly, the shippers are often kept out of the delivery chain and are affected by or not involved in any incentives or logs. Last but not least, users' privacy can be easily compromised and sensitive data collected and generated during the transactions can be easily accessed and abused. Building upon these critical insights, we propose a novel decentralized marketplace mechanism using the smart contract via blockchain technology. Our approach operates by incentivizing all the participants to act honestly and fulfill their obligations without resorting to a trusted third party. It also integrates adapted access control protocols to protect user privacy. The model's architecture shows that our approach guarantees integrity and robustness. It contributes to effectively addressing the issues listed above.

Furthermore, it is beyond the data owner's capability to perceive whether a service provider complies with the GDPR and effectively protects her personal data. This motivates us to envision a design concept for developing a GDPR-compliant personal data management platform leveraging the emerging blockchain and smart contract technologies. The goals of the platform are to provide decentralised mechanisms to both service providers and data owners for processing personal data; meanwhile, empower data provenance and transparency by leveraging advanced features of the blockchain technology. The platform enables data owners to impose data usage consent, ensures only designated parties can process personal data, and logs all data activities in an immutable distributed ledger using smart contract and cryptography techniques. By honestly participating in the platform, a service provider can be endorsed by the blockchain network that it is fully GDPR-compliant; otherwise, any violation is immutably recorded and is easily figured out by associated parties. We then demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed design concept by developing a profile management platform implemented on top of the Hyperledger Fabric permissioned blockchain framework, following by valuable analysis and discussion.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2019.2948287","Imperial College London; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8876647","Blockchain;data management;GDPR;personal data;smart contract","General Data Protection Regulation;Blockchain;Distributed databases;Bitcoin;Smart contracts","cryptography;data privacy;data protection;legislation","data owners;empower data provenance;data usage consent;data activities;general data protection regulation;data owner;service provider complies;GDPR-compliant personal data management platform;blockchain-based solution;smart contract technologies;blockchain technology;smart contract;cryptography techniques;hyperledger fabric permissioned blockchain framework","","16","","56","CCBY","21 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we investigate the problem of how to provide continuous incentives based on user's performances to encourage users' participation in the crowdsourcing, which can be referred to the moral hazard problem in the contract theory. We not only propose the one-dimensional performance-reward related contract, but also extend this basic model into the multi-dimensional contract. First, an incentive contract which rewards users by evaluating their performances from multiple dimensions is proposed. Then, the utility maximization problem of the principal in both one-dimension and multi-dimension are formulated. Furthermore, we detailed the analysis of the multi-dimensional contract to allocate incentives. Finally, we use the numerical results to analyze the optimal reward package, and compare the principal's utility under the different incentive mechanisms. Results demonstrate that by using the proposed incentive mechanism, the principal successfully maximizes the utilities, and the users obtain continuous incentives to participate in the crowdsourcing activity.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2017.2732982","NSF(grant numbers:CNS-1717454,CNS- 1731424,CNS-1702850,CNS-1646607,ECCS-1547201,CMMI-1434789,CNS-1443917,ECCS-1405121,CNS-1343361,CNS-1350230); Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF); Ministry of Education(grant numbers:NRF-2016R1D1A1B01015320); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995145","Crowdsourcing;incentive mechanism;multi-dimension;moral hazard;contract theory","Crowdsourcing;Contracts;Google;Mobile computing;Ethics;Hazards;Smart phones","5G mobile communication;cloud computing;contracts;crowdsourcing;incentive schemes;mobile computing;optimisation","multidimensional incentive mechanism;mobile crowdsourcing;current wireless communication systems;location based services;future 5G networks;moral hazard problem;contract theory;one-dimensional performance-reward related contract;multidimensional contract;incentive contract;utility maximization problem;optimal reward package;crowdsourcing activity;incentive mechanisms;central cloud node","","18","","31","IEEE","28 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although network slicing can realize the flexible division of 5g network resources and quickly customize virtual networks that meet the differentiated needs of customers, it is still difficult to determine the optimal service quality parameters in application scenarios. To solve the problem, this paper designs a multi-chain 5G network slicing service quality computing model to calculate the service quality parameters of the network slicing. The calculated service quality parameters can be used as an adjustment basis in the negotiation of the SLA between the customer and the network operator. However, the traditional method of calculating information across chains will cause frequent information interactions and affect efficiency. Therefore, in this scheme, we deploy a smart contract on each blockchain to calculate the information, which can reduce the frequency of information transmission and improve efficiency. In addition, in order to make the calculation between smart contracts more fluent and the requirements more relevant, this paper proposes to coordinate the development of smart contracts through multiple blockchains. Besides, to ensure the cross-chain security calculation, the signature by Cosi protocol and multi-signcryption algorithms are used in the transmission of non-private information and private information in the cross-chain process respectively. Security analysis and experimental results prove that the multi-chain 5G network slicing service quality computing model is feasible and efficient in practice.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3132388","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61802005); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality(grant numbers:M21029); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9634104","multi-chain;cross-chain;5G;network slicing;smart contract.","Network slicing;5G mobile communication;Smart contracts;Blockchains;Computational modeling;Security;Internet of Things","","","","","","","IEEE","3 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Reputation solutions based on third-party platforms face a problem of single-point failures and reputation solutions based on blockchain face problems of storage and query efficiency. To improve storage and query efficiency, this paper proposes a multi-chain charging model that stores different types of information on different blockchains. However, it faces the problem of unreliable information called across chains, when calculating reputation across chains. Therefore, this paper proposes a cross-chain trusted smart contract (C2T smart contract) to ensure the authenticity, real-time, and inter-chain write mutual exclusion of cross-chain information, making reputation calculation in the multi-chain charging model more convenient and more accurate. Specially, we propose a data mutual trust mechanism based on merkel proof to ensure the authenticity of cross-chain information and prevent forged information from participating in calculating reputation. Furthermore, we present a data structure composed of multiple counting bloom filters (MCBF) to verify the real-time of information and filter out non-real-time information, thereby ensuring the real-time of the calculated reputation. In addition, we put forward an algorithm to guarantee the inter-chain write mutual exclusion by hash mutexes, making the reputation calculation process more accurate and complete. The security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that C2T smart contract is feasible in practice.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3099898","Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality(grant numbers:21M20004); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61802005); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9495937","multi-chain;cross-chain;charging model;reputation;smart contract.","Blockchains;Smart contracts;Real-time systems;Internet of Things;Faces;Data models;Special issues and sections","","","","","","","IEEE","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Indeed, a widespread strategy for organizations is to join in inter-organizational processes, which set collaborations and resource sharing among involved organizations. However, the possible lack of trust among the organizations poses relevant issues on the processing of sensitive resources. A promising approach to cope with this issue is leveraging on blockchain technology. Thanks to its design and consensus algorithm, blockchain provides a trustworthy infrastructure that allows partners involved in the collaboration to monitor and perform audits on the workflow transitions. In general, the focus of the existing blockchain-based workflow management solutions is mainly workflow coordination. However, a challenging characteristic of some workflows is that they require the exchange of a big amount of data that has to be managed off-chain, that is, directly exchanged between data producer and consumer. This off-chain data sharing should be secured and controlled such to follow the workflow execution.To cope with this challenge, in this paper, we propose a controlled information sharing in inter-organizational workflows enforced via smart contracts. Smart contracts are designed to coordinate the workflow execution, as well as to deploy a set of authorizations granting access only to the task executor and only to those resources needed for task execution and only during the task activation. We have also run a set of experiments to show the feasibility of our approach.","2474-2473","978-1-7281-8789-1","10.1109/SCC49832.2020.00056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9284604","Access control;Collaborative processes;Blockchain;Smart contracts","Smart contracts;Collaboration;Service computing;Blockchain;Organizations;Information management;Task analysis","blockchains;business data processing;data analysis;workflow management software","business goals;blockchain-based workflow management solutions;blockchain-based workflow management solutions;blockchain-based controlled information sharing;smart contracts;workflow execution;off-chain data sharing;data producer;workflow coordination;consensus algorithm;sensitive resources;resource sharing;inter-organizational processes;market requirements;inter-organizational workflows","","","","24","","11 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Garpetun",Vattenfall Eldistribution AB-Sweden,"22nd International Conference and Exhibition on Electricity Distribution (CIRED 2013)","16 Dec 2013","2013","","","1","4","By using data from smart meters, meter values and Power Quality events, it's possible to improve the analyze methods and network calculations. Better understanding of the grid behavior and customers load pattern will make it possible to better predict the need of reinforcements and avoid unnecessary investments, especially for grid areas with more volatile loads caused by large amount of photovoltaic solar panels (PV) and electrical vehicles (EV). Both fulfillment of customer promises (supply contract) and acceptable level of distribution fees (tariffs) will set the focus on asset management costs and investment strategies. Up to now the information in the Customer Information System, CIS, are the only source for customer related information regarding load, total energy consumption and the customers load pattern. The network analyses and planning activities will give acceptable good results if these data always are updated and in good shape, but it has been shown that this is not always the case. It has in this report been shown that network analysis and calculations based on meter values instead of traditional methods using static load curves gives better results and most likely large benefits for the asset management process such as avoiding oversized assets in general, possibility to postpone asset investments and allow new customers to be connect to the grid without any mayor asset investments (new substations or upsized transformers). By measure the total feed-in energy at transformer level in the secondary substation it's possible to monitor the network losses with good accuracy. It's possible to detect wrongly installed meters and none measured consumption if the load is sufficient high. But this also set the focus on data quality issues, reliability of the grid documentation and customer data are crucial.

However, optimizing and managing these systems is a big challenge because it is only done in a distributed way. One of the best methods of managing a smart grid is the use of artificial intelligence (AI), especially multi-agent systems (MAS) approaches. MASs present a comprise of two or more independent agents with some information to achieve a set target that is capable of achieving multiple real-time objectives easily. Several multiagent approaches have been proposed these last years, This work constitutes a demonstration of one of those methods which is the contract net protocol (CNP). The CNP is a technique invented to solve communication problems in distributed networks. It was defined as a high-level protocol for communication among the nodes in distributed problem solver. We will use the extended version of the contract net protocol(ECNP) to optimize the movement of MASs inside a smart grid network. Our example of a smart grid will be a grid constituted from nodes, and each node is a location of a task or an agent. In the scenario each task it's given a target which is also a node inside the grid, and our main objective is that the agent or agents could contribute for each task, depending on their priority order and may allow it to reach its target, which is another node in the network far from its initial location, using the shortest way as possible. A first scenario is used that includes a certain number of tasks and agents, to demonstrate the efficiency and power of the ECNP (extended contract net protocol), and the role of MAS in distributed management of smart grids.","","978-1-7281-8084-7","10.1109/ICDS50568.2020.9268763","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9268763","Microgrid;Multi-agent systems;Contract net protocol;Auction algorithm;Event-triggered consensus;Event-Based Sampling Schemes","Microgrids;Task analysis;Protocols;Contracts;Smart grids;Laboratories;Job shop scheduling","distributed power generation;multi-agent systems;power engineering computing;protocols;smart power grids","high-level protocol;distributed problem;smart grid network;extended contract net protocol;distributed management;multiagents;defined environment;distributed energy sources;multiagent systems;independent agents;distributed networks","","","","47","","30 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In present times, a smart healthcare system with a blockchain data network and healthcare 4.0 processes provides transparency, easy and faster accessibility, security, efficiency, etc. Healthcare 4.0 trends include industry 4.0 processes such as the internet of things (IoT), industrial IoT (IIoT), cognitive computing, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, fog computing, edge computing, etc. The goal of this work is to design a smart healthcare system and it is found to be possible through integration and interoperability of Blockchain 3.0 and Healthcare 4.0 in consideration with healthcare ground-realities. Here, healthcare 4.0 processes used for data accessibility are targeted to be validated through statistical simulation-optimization methods and algorithms. The blockchain is implemented in the Ethereum network, and with associated programming languages, tools, and techniques such as solidity, web3.js, Athena, etc. Further, this work prepares a comparative and comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art blockchain-based smart healthcare systems. The comprehensive survey includes methodology, applications, requirements, outcomes, future directions, etc. A list of groups, organizations, and enterprises are prepared that are working in electronic health records (EHR), electronic medical records (EMR) or electronic personal records (EPR) mainly, and a comparative analysis is drawn concerning adopting the blockchain technology in their processes. This work has explored optimization algorithms applicable to Healthcare 4.0 trends and improves the performance of blockchain-based decentralized applications for the smart healthcare system. Further, smart contracts and their designs are prepared for the proposed system to expedite the trust-building and payment systems. This work has considered simulation and implementation to validate the proposed approach. Simulation results show that the Gas value required (indicating block size and expenditure) lies within current Etherum network Gas limits. The proposed system is active because block utilization lies above 80%. Automated smart contract execution is below 20 seconds. A good number (average 3 per simulation time) is generated in the network that indicates a health competition. Although there is error observed in simulation and implementation that lies between 0.55% and 4.24%, these errors are not affecting overall system performance because simulated and actual (taken in state-of-the-art) data variations are negligible.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3004790","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9125923","Block;blockchain 3.0;healthcare 4.0;Industrial IoT (IIoT);Industry 4.0;Internet of Things (IoT);mining optimization;smart solution;transaction","Medical services;Blockchain;Smart contracts;Market research;Industries;Cloud computing","cloud computing;cryptography;electronic health records;health care;Internet;optimisation;programming languages;statistical analysis","payment systems;trust-building;data variations;blockchain-based decentralized applications;optimization algorithms;EMR;electronic medical records;EHR;electronic health records;Ethereum network;programming languages;statistical simulation-optimization methods;data accessibility;blockchain 3.0;artificial intelligence;IIoT;industrial IoT;Internet of Things;novel smart healthcare design;blockchain-based smart healthcare systems;electronic personal records;healthcare ground-realities;cognitive computing;blockchain data network;decentralized data network;blockchain technology;Healthcare 4.0 processes;time 20.0 s","","6","","101","CCBY","25 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Current proof of delivery (PoD) systems lacks transparency, traceability, and credibility. These systems are mostly centralized and rely on trusted third parties (TTPs) to complete the delivery between sellers and buyers. TTPs can be costly, a single point of failure, and subject to hacking, privacy evasion, and compromise. The blockchain is an immutable, trusted, and decentralized ledger with logs and events that can be used for transparency, traceability, and tracking. In this paper, we present a solution and a general framework using the popular permissionless Ethereum blockchain to create a trusted, decentralized PoD system that ensures accountability, auditability, and integrity. The solution uses Ethereum smart contracts to prove the delivery of a shipped item between a seller and a buyer irrespective of the number of intermediate transporters needed. In our proposed solution, all participating entities are incentivized to act honestly by using a double deposit collateral. Automated payment in ether is an integral part of a solution to ensure that every entity gets its intended share of ether upon successful delivery. An arbitration mechanism is also incorporated if a dispute arises during the shipping process. In this paper, we show how we implemented, verified, and tested the proper functionality of our PoD solution. We also provide security analysis and give estimates of the cost consumption in ether gas.

One such smart contract system that has seen widespread practical adoption is Ethereum, which has grown to a market capacity of 100 billion USD and clears an excess of 500,000 daily transactions. Unfortunately, the rise of these technologies has been marred by a series of costly bugs and exploits. Increasingly, the Ethereum community has turned to formal methods and rigorous program analysis tools. This trend holds great promise due to the relative simplicity of smart contracts and bounded-time deterministic execution inherent to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Here we present KEVM, an executable formal specification of the EVM's bytecode stack-based language built with the K Framework, designed to serve as a solid foundation for further formal analyses. We empirically evaluate the correctness and performance of KEVM using the official Ethereum test suite. To demonstrate the usability, several extensions of the semantics are presented. and two different-language implementations of the ERC20 Standard Token are verified against the ERC20 specification.

In practice, attributes usually have a certain lifespan. The existing time-based access control methods directly relate attribute keys to time. Thus, under the constraint of fine-grained time, when the attribute expires, the update of key and policy adds a large additional burden to the data user and owner. In this paper, we propose a dynamic attribute-based access control scheme to set a fine-grained valid time period for each attribute, which not only facilitates dynamic data sharing, but also enables flexible attribute revocation. We use smart contract to set valid time period for attributes. It provides smart management on users' attributes and avoids the waiting time of CSP caused by manual operations. We also introduce trapdoor that are indirectly related to time and proxy decryption method to reduce computational cost on data owners and users.

However, current blockchain systems are not capable of scaling in accordance to the huge IoT data without a loss in speed and time efficiency. Therefore, we use the concept of sidechains and offline data storage to alleviate the scalability issue of blockchains.

Enterprises are increasingly adopting a multicloud approach to leverage the latest innovations and unique capabilities of different cloud providers. This is resulting in multicloud systems that utilize independent services, which in turn may be dependent on other services. Clients rely on Service Level Agreements (SLAs) to ensure a minimum quality of service. However, monitoring service quality becomes difficult in a multi-level and multi-provider system due to decentralized control and lack of visibility in the entire system hierarchy. SLA violations often go undetected as multicloud systems lack automated means to monitor SLAs and conduct root cause analysis of violations. We propose SLAM, an autonomous and trusted framework for continuous SLA monitoring in a multicloud ecosystem. It is based on blockchain and leverages smart contracts to detect SLA violations and determine their root cause across the hierarchical system structure.","","978-1-7281-8266-7","10.1109/IEEECloudSummit48914.2020.00011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9283734","cloud computing;service level agreement;multi-cloud;blockchain;smart contract;monitoring;quality of service","Technological innovation;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Ecosystems;Smart contracts;Blockchain;Monitoring;Standards","application program interfaces;blockchains;cloud computing;contracts;quality of service;trusted computing","SLAM;SLA management;multicloud ecosystem;blockchain;cloud marketplaces;service level agreements;service quality monitoring;decentralized control;SLA monitoring;smart contracts;API centric services;quality of service;autonomous framework;trusted framework","","","","19","","15 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many of these constructions, including operational payment channels and atomic swaps, use a building block called Hashed Time-Locked Contract (HTLC).In this work, we distill from HTLC a specification (HTLC-Spec), and present an implementation called Mutual-Assured-Destruction Hashed Time-Locked Contract (MAD-HTLC). MAD-HTLC employs a novel approach of utilizing the existing blockchain operators, called miners, as part of the design. If a user misbehaves, MAD-HTLC incentivizes the miners to confiscate all her funds. We prove MAD-HTLC’s security using the UC framework and game-theoretic analysis. We demonstrate MAD-HTLC’s efficacy and analyze its overhead by instantiating it on Bitcoin’s and Ethereum’s operational blockchains.Notably, current miner software makes only little effort to optimize revenue, since the advantage is relatively small. However, as the demand grows and other revenue components shrink, miners are more motivated to fully optimize their fund intake. By patching the standard Bitcoin client, we demonstrate such optimization is easy to implement, making the miners natural enforcers of MAD-HTLC.Finally, we extend previous results regarding HTLC vulnerability to bribery attacks. An attacker can incentivize miners to prefer her transactions by offering high transaction fees. We demonstrate this attack can be easily implemented by patching the Bitcoin client, and use game-theoretic tools to qualitatively tighten the known cost bound of such bribery attacks in presence of rational miners. We identify bribe opportunities occurring on the Bitcoin and Ethereum main networks where a few dollars bribe could yield tens of thousands of dollars in reward (e.g., $2 for over $25K).","2375-1207","978-1-7281-8934-5","10.1109/SP40001.2021.00080","Israel Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9519476","Blockchain;Smart-contracts;Mechanism-design","Privacy;Smart contracts;Bitcoin;Tools;Software;Blockchains;Security","blockchains;contracts;cryptographic protocols;formal specification;game theory","Mutual-Assured-Destruction Hashed Time-Locked Contract;called miners;MAD-HTLC's security;MAD-HTLC's efficacy;HTLC vulnerability;HTLC-Spec;MAD-HTLC;Ethereum operational blockchains","","","","133","","26 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Towards a Blockchain Weather Derivative Financial Instrument for Hedging Volumetric Risks of Solar Power Producers","O. Alao; P.

Temperature-based weather derivatives have recently emerged as an effective volumetric risk cross-hedge for Solar Power Producers, given that temperature positively correlates with solar radiation. Temperature-based put and call options, mostly traded on organized exchanges, require users to pay premiums that are costly and difficult to price. Swap contracts can serve as an economical alternative since they do not require premiums. However, they are only traded over-the-counter and are thus illiquid and liable to counterparty credit risks.

This kind of services usually relies heavily on the use of trusted third parties. These entities are an obstacle to extend the use of protocols. In this paper, we use the blockchain-based technologies to provide, for the first time, two multiparty registered eDelivery schemes that reduce the involvement of trusted third parties compared with traditional approaches while satisfying the requirements of the norms created by the European Union for registered eDeliveries. Since confidentiality is not considered a compulsory property in the directive, we propose two protocols. The first one is well suited for those deliveries that do not require the confidentiality of the message or delivered data or even for those in which it is required that the message can be public and accessible to everybody.

To obtain insights of such a highly coupled system, we consider both monopoly and duopoly markets, where the two services are operated by a single service provider (SP) and two different SPs, respectively. For the monopoly market, we propose a three-stage Stackelberg game model. For the duopoly market, we propose a two-stage Bertrand competition and Cournot competition. We provided the SP's optimal pricing strategies and decisions in the monopoly market, and the optimal pricing contract and quantity contract for SPs in the duopoly market with Bertrand competition and Cournot competition. Both the analytical and simulation results show that, in the monopoly market, offering two charging options can potentially improve the SP's profit compared with offering one option only in the monopoly market; while in the duopoly market, it is optimal for SPs to offer the quantity contract rather than the price contract to maximize profits.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2020.3020044","UESTC Funds for Outstanding Talents(grant numbers:A1098531023601183); National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61801315); NSFC(grant numbers:61902255); Basic Research Project of Shenzhen Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:JCYJ20190808163417094); Research Start-Up Foundation of Shenzhen(grant numbers:827-000415); Natural Science Foundation of Shenzhen University(grant numbers:2019045,860-000002110540); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9179771","PEV charging;Stackelberg game;bertrand and cournot competition","Monopoly;Contracts;Pricing;Charging stations;Games;Oligopoly;Throughput","battery powered vehicles;contracts;electric vehicles;game theory;oligopoly;optimisation;pricing;profitability","multiple charging options;service providers;optimal strategy;public plug-in electric vehicle charging services;slow charging service;travel distance;charging station;charging prices;charging time;duopoly markets;single service provider;monopoly market;duopoly market;two-stage Bertrand competition;Cournot competition;optimal pricing strategies;optimal pricing contract;offering one option;price contract","","2","","25","IEEE","28 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Further, the health data are sensitive, and any breach in security may lead to wrong treatment or compromising the privacy of the patients. In this regard, a secure IoT frame is desirable, which is capable of preserving the integrity and confidentiality of the medical data. In this paper, we have proposed a novel architecture which leverages the blockchain technology to enhance the security and privacy of IoT for healthcare applications. In the proposed architecture called smart healthcare system for patients in ICU (SHPI), critical data is processed in edge computing which is located inside the hospital to reduce the communication latency. In order to provide tramper-proof medical records and data confidentiality SHPI uses blockchain technology and cryptographic methods respectively. Also, a data accessing token system is introduced to separate the group of users based on their roles. This system utilizes smart contracts to record every event for providing transparency in medical activities.

Particularly, in the peak time, the computational tasks can be offloaded from the overloaded base stations to fog servers by leveraging the under-utilized computational resources at the demand side. However, there are two major obstacles hindering the wide deployment of fog computing in Internet of things, which are the lack of an effective incentive mechanism and a task offloading algorithm. In this paper, we develop a two-stage resource sharing and task offloading approach by integrating contract theory with computational intelligence. In the first stage, we propose an efficient incentive mechanism to encourage servers to share their residual computational resources by employing the contract theory. In the second stage, a distributed task offloading algorithm is proposed by leveraging the online learning capability of multi-armed bandit. Specifically, we propose a distance-aware, occurrence-aware, and task-property-aware volatile upper confidence bound algorithm to minimize the long-term delay of task offloading.

Existing research has shown that the centralized systems, as the mainstream mode, are under the great risks. Motivated by this, we propose a consortium blockchain based PHR management and sharing scheme, which is both security-aware and privacy-preserving. We adopt the interplanetary file system (IPFS) to store PHR ciphertext of IoMT. Then, Zero-knowledge proof can provide evidence for verifying keyword index authentication on blockchain. Moreover, the scheme jointly leverages modified attribute-based cryptographic primitives and tailor-made smart contracts to achieve secure search, privacy preservation, and personalized access control in IoMT scenarios.

One of the major reasons behind this is the unregulated and complex drug supply chain. When a drug consignment change ownership from manufacturer to distributor and then to the wholesaler, no information is exchanged between the parties. We lack adequate auditability and transparency of the original source of drugs. Consequences include counterfeit drug problem, inefficient recall process of the drugs and lack of trust. By putting the entire drug supply chain of India on Blockchain, we propose to perform a quantitative analysis on leveraging unique blockchain properties like authenticity, accountability, and ability to handle sensitive information to solve India's counterfeit drugs problem permanently. It will strengthen the supply chain and will introduce the much-needed transparency of transactions and quality assurance by tracking a drug through its entire lifecycle from the extraction of raw materials to the patient taking the drug. Along with this, smart contracts can be deployed which will provide automation, trust, and security to the system. Smart contracts are digital protocols that can be programmed to perform a task when a particular goal is reached without any intervention of a third party and can facilitate services like automatic payments, quality control, and trust between stakeholders.","","978-1-5386-5933-5","10.1109/CONFLUENCE.2019.8776891","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8776891","Counterfeit drugs;Blockchain;fake drugs;Pharmaceutical supply chain","Drugs;Blockchain;Supply chains;Smart contracts;Fabrics;Government;Peer-to-peer computing","contracts;counterfeit goods;cryptocurrencies;distributed databases;drugs;pharmaceutical industry;quality control;raw materials;supply chain management;supply chains","fake drug industry;cost-effective generic drugs;African countries;United Nations aid;complex drug supply chain;India's counterfeit drugs problem;blockchain technology;auditability;raw materials;smart contracts;digital protocols;quality control","","5","","21","","29 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to ensure data security and privacy, data are usually stored on the cloud server in the form of ciphertext. When a user requests access to the encrypted data, an access key distributed by a third party is needed. However, if the third party is dishonest, the security of the system will be threatened. Faced with this problem, in this paper, we propose a new secure cloud storage framework with access control by using the Ethereum blockchain technology. Our new scheme is a combination of Ethereum blockchain and ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE). The proposed cloud storage framework is decentralized, that is, there is no trusted third party in the system. Our scheme has three main features. First, as the Ethereum blockchain technology is used, the data owner can store ciphertext of data through smart contracts in a blockchain network. Second, the data owner can set valid access periods for data usage so that the ciphertext can only be decrypted during valid access periods. Finally, as the creation and invocation of each smart contract can be stored in the blockchain, thus, the function of the trace is achieved. The analysis of the security and experiment shows that our scheme is feasible.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2929205","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61572019); Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi(grant numbers:2019GY-028); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8770246","Cloud storage;access control;Ethereum;blockchain;smart contract","Blockchain;Access control;Cloud computing;Encryption;Smart contracts;Computer science","authorisation;cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;distributed databases;storage management","secure cloud storage framework;access control;data security;cloud server;encrypted data;access key;Ethereum blockchain technology;ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption;data owner;blockchain network;valid access periods;data usage;user access request;cloud services;data privacy;decentralized cloud storage framework;smart contracts;security analysis;decryption","","11","","32","CCBY","23 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An appealing feature of blockchain technology is smart contracts. A smart contract is an executable code. It runs on top of the blockchain facilitating an agreement between untrusted parties. These smart contracts have a major limitation, namely they cannot operate on information external to the blockchain. The inability to query such information has paved the need for trusted entities called “oracles.” These oracles attest to facts without the robust security guarantees that blockchains generally provide. This can potentially harm the integrity of the network and lead to centralized points-of-failure. To address this concern, this article proposes a decentralized oracle which is based on a voting-based game that decides the truth or falsity of queries. In the context of this article, we are only interested in binary markets, i.e., queries which can be True, False, or Unknown. When requesting facts from an oracle, a user submits binary queries. Reporters (or certifiers) respond to the queries by placing monetary stake. A formal analysis of the system parameters is presented, which shows that the proposed platform incentivizes a Nash equilibrium for truthful reporting. An extension to the base protocol is also described and profiled against the original framework. Finally, we discuss a prototype architecture, along with additional features to be considered during implementation.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2020.2993673","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9113449","Blockchain;crowdsourcing;decentralized oracle;permissioned;permissionless;Nash equilibrium;voting","Blockchain;Nash equilibrium;Games;Smart contracts;Task analysis;Mathematical model","computer network security;contracts;crowdsourcing;cryptographic protocols;game theory;Internet;trusted computing","Internet;Nash equilibrium;base protocol;binary queries;voting-based game;robust security guarantees;information external;untrusted parties;executable code;smart contract;blockchain technology;decentralized blockchain oracle;public crowdsource-based mechanisms","","2","","34","IEEE","10 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The appalling nature of Ethereum transactions to have both, security and threat at a comparable level, demands analytics for inferring traits for better perspectives and insights. This research work focuses on characteristic analysis of Ethereum transaction space for inferring behavioural traits in supervised and unsupervised context. In an unsupervised environment, raw transaction data is extradited to a tabular transaction structure by selecting appropriate features. The data is further clustered and validated to form coherent groupings of similar patterns. The clusters are characteristically analyzed based on the features through Radar plots for inferring behavioural traits. In supervised context, labelled transactions are represented using histograms and feature-based characteristic analysis is performed to infer traits. Such analytics lay foundations for future deeper analysis that can be used to discover trends and patterns to understand the transaction network, enhancement of trading strategies, identification of bot activities, anomaly detection and several others.","","978-1-7281-9080-8","10.1109/ICCP51029.2020.9266176","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9266176","Ethereum;Blockchain;Analytics;Clustering;Behaviour","Radar;Blockchain;Clustering algorithms;Histograms;Market research;Smart contracts;Machine learning algorithms","behavioural sciences computing;contracts;cryptocurrencies;data analysis;financial data processing;financial management;pattern clustering;supervised learning;transaction processing;unsupervised learning","decentralized applications;Ethereum cryptocurrency;public ledger recording;Ethereum transactions;behavioural traits;histograms;feature-based characteristic analysis;transaction network;transactional data analytics;Ethereum blockchain network;smart contracts;supervised context;unsupervised context;anomaly detection","","","","24","","26 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a case study, we carry out an analysis in terms of quantifying the risk associated to a multi-layered Blockchain framework for Smart Mobility Data-markets (BSMD). We first construct an actor-based analysis to determine the impact of the attacks. Then, a scenario-based analysis determines the probability of occurrence of each threat. Finally, a combined analysis is developed to determine which attack outcomes have the highest risk. In the case study of the public permissioned BSMD, the outcomes of the risk analysis highlight the highest risk factors according to their impact on the victims in terms of monetary, privacy, integrity and trust.

Compared to the traditional finance, DeFi allows customers to flexibly participate in diverse blockchain financial services (e.g., lending, borrowing, collateralizing, exchanging etc.) via smart contracts at a relatively low cost of trust. However, the open nature of DeFi inevitably introduces a large attack surface, which is a severe threat to the security of participantsfunds. In this paper, we proposed BLOCKEYE, a real-time attack detection system for DeFi projects on the Ethereum blockchain. Key capabilities provided by BLOCKEYE are twofold: (1) Potentially vulnerable DeFi projects are identified based on an automatic security analysis process, which performs symbolic reasoning on the data flow of important service states, e.g., asset price, and checks whether they can be externally manipulated. (2) Then, a transaction monitor is installed offchain for a vulnerable DeFi project. Transactions sent not only to that project but other associated projects as well are collected for further security analysis. A potential attack is flagged if a violation is detected on a critical invariant configured in BLOCKEYE, e.g., Benefit is achieved within a very short time and way much bigger than the cost. We applied BLOCKEYE in several popular DeFi projects and managed to discover potential security attacks that are unreported before.

A crowd-intelligence ecosystem involves three stakeholders, namely the platform, workers (e.g., individuals, sensors, or processors), and task publisher. The stakeholders have no mutual trust but interest conflict, which means bad cooperation of them. Due to lack of trust, transferring raw data (e.g., pictures or video clips) between publisher and workers requires the remote platform center to serve as a relay node, which implies network congestion. First, we use a reward-penalty model to align the incentives of stakeholders.

Brokers will ensure that the land/property would be registered by an authorised government office where all the attributes are noted down in a ledger and thereafter the whole transaction and purchasement between the two parties takes place. In this scenario, there are chances of losing or tampering of the documents as anyone with certain powers can access or alter the papers easily which in turn threatens this concrete proof of land. Thus, this type of system as compared to our proposed system in which we make use of a smart contract to deal with the assets and transactions among the participants, is relatively time consuming, less secure and unsynchronized where activities including corruption and fraudulence might be associated during the execution of the required process. With an amalgam of inspection and analysis regarding the old accustomed way and considering that Blockchain has an increased transparency and integrity maintenance along with the portability factor, we put forward a blockchain based land registration system which provides a transparent, secured and decentralised method for execution of transactions between the participants by employing the concept of hyper ledger.","","978-1-7281-5970-6","10.1109/ICSIDEMPC49020.2020.9299606","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9299606","Block-chain;Land;Hyper-ledger;land registration;secure","Blockchain;Distributed ledger;Business;Fabrics;Smart contracts;Cryptography;Peer-to-peer computing","authorisation;blockchains;contracts;property market","India;middle man;broker;obligatory physical documents;authorised government office;fraudulence;blockchain based land registration system;portability factor;hyper ledger;smart contract","","","","13","","1 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

DSM has the potential to significantly improve smart grid operations by reducing the peak to average ratio. Current DSM schemes are able to reduce peak load by as much as 30% which can translate to significant cost savings and reduction in green house emissions. But for realistic deployment of DSM systems in the grid there are two very important aspects which need to be considered: scalability and user acceptability. Since the current DSM algorithms are required to control potentially hundreds of thousands of devices, they have to be scalable and tractable for such myriad numbers. On the other hand DSM affects the life style of the consumer and this should be as less disruptive as possible. The various DSM techniques proposed in the literature attempt to first reduce the cost and then attempt to resolve one of the two aforementioned aspects. The result is that the techniques are either scalable or are only considerate of the deadlines of the consumers. An ideal system should cater to both of these aspects. Our system Deli2P is user centric and scalable thus catering to both of these aspects. Essentially we provide to the consumer a deadline centric interface. The deadlines solutions are generally not scalable. But instead of solving this problem as a scheduling for deadline problem we transform the problem to a priority-based problem thus making it scalable for large number of devices. Our results show that with this scheme we can reduce peak power by upto 30% but without violating consumers' deadlines.","","978-9-8975-8134-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7297970","Smart Grids;Demand Side Management;Peak Reduction;Demand Elasticity","Image color analysis;Color;Smart grids;Contracts;Processor scheduling;Schedules","","","","","","20","","15 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing approaches to blockchain-based process execution are based on code generation. In these approaches, a process model is compiled into one or more smart contracts, which are then deployed on a blockchain platform. Given the immutability of the deployed smart contracts, these compiled approaches ensure that all process instances conform to the process model. However, this advantage comes at the price of inflexibility. Any changes to the process model require the redeployment of the smart contracts (a costly operation). In addition, changes cannot be applied to running process instances. To address this lack of flexibility, this paper presents an interpreter of BPMN process models based on dynamic data structures. The proposed interpreter is embedded in a business process execution system with a modular multi-layered architecture, supporting the creation, execution, monitoring and dynamic update of process instances. For efficiency purposes, the interpreter relies on compact bitmap-based encodings of process models. An experimental evaluation shows that the proposed interpreted approach achieves comparable or lower costs relative to existing compiled approaches.","2325-6362","978-1-7281-2702-6","10.1109/EDOC.2019.00033","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8944990","Blockchain, Model-Driven Engineering, Business Process Management System, Flexible Process Execution","Smart contracts;Blockchain;Data models;Task analysis;Process control;Data structures","business data processing;contracts;cryptography;data structures;distributed databases;program compilers;program interpreters","process instances;interpreter;business process models;blockchain technology;interorganizational business processes;blockchain platform;smart contracts;BPMN process models;business process execution system;tamper-proof mechanism;data structures","","3","","15","","30 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As fog nodes are deployed in close proximity to IoT devices, fog computing can be more effective than cloud computing. Furthermore, Blockchain has emerged as technology with capabilities to provide secure management, authentication and access to IoT devices and their data, in decentralized manner with high trust, integrity, and resiliency.

However, this new model brings challenges concerning unclear responsibility, misunderstandings of the latest plan and complex operation. To solve these issues, we introduce a new blockchain-based bilateral transaction platform. It enables participants to change prescheduled multiple contracts simultaneously in a cost-effective way. After each transaction is agreed, the platform transmits updates to all participants concerned using blockchain functions.

In an operational setting, DR is considered as an RO contract allowing an aggregator seeking to maximize its revenue to sell flexible demand in the day-ahead market and balance its energy portfolio in the balancing markets. Sequential Monte Carlo simulations (SMCS) are used to value DR activation decisions based on market price evolutions. These decisions combine DR physical characteristics and portfolio scheduling optimization, whereby the aggregator chooses to exercise only the contracts probabilistically leading to a profit, also considering the physical payback effects of load recovery. Sensitivity of profits to changing market conditions and payback characteristics is also assessed. In an investment setting, subject to long-term uncertainties, the value of an investment in DR-enabling technology is quantified through the Datar-Mathews RO approach that applies hybrid SMCS and scenario analysis. The results show how the flexibility value of DR can be highlighted by modeling it as RO, particularly in high volatile markets, and how realistic inclusion of payback characteristics significantly decrease the benefits estimated for DR. In addition, the proposed RO framework generally allows hedging of the risks incurred under long-term and short-term uncertainties.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2015.2405673","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council within the Autonomic Power Systems Project(grant numbers:EP/I031650/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7055902","Demand response (DR);flexibility;real options (ROs);risk hedging;sequential Monte Carlo simulations (SMCS);uncertainty;Demand response (DR);flexibility;real options (ROs);risk hedging;sequential Monte Carlo simulations (SMCS);uncertainty","Contracts;Portfolios;Home appliances;Electricity;Load modeling;Investment;Planning","demand side management;Monte Carlo methods;power markets;power system planning","demand response contracts;probabilistic evaluation framework;long-term uncertainties;short-term uncertainties;DR customer portfolio;operational planning uncertainties;real options modeling;RO modeling;RO contract;flexible demand;day-ahead market;energy portfolio;sequential Monte Carlo simulations;SMCS;market price evolutions;portfolio scheduling optimization;load recovery;payback characteristics;Datar-Mathews RO approach","","26","","43","IEEE","6 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

BAFFLE leverages Smart Contracts (SC) to coordinate the round delineation, model aggregation and update tasks in FL. BAFFLE boosts computational performance by decomposing the global parameter space into distinct chunks followed by a score and bid strategy. In order to characterize the performance of BAFFLE, we conduct experiments on a private Ethereum network and use the centralized and aggregator driven methods as our benchmark. We show that BAFFLE significantly reduces the gas costs for FL on the blockchain as compared to a direct adaptation of the aggregator based method.

However, for relevant authorities to be able to identify misbehaving vehicles through their pseudonyms, it is essential that the privacy protection mechanisms only allow for conditional anonymity and not complete anonymity. In this paper, we propose the use of a permissioned consortium blockchain system with smart contract feature to facilitate secure and conditional privacy-preserving vehicular pseudonym issuance and management in a multi-jurisdictional road network. The use of a permissioned consortium blockchain helps mitigate security risks associated with the complexities in interorganizational data handling, such as in the areas of access control, data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. The proposed system architecture takes advantage of the predicted wide availability of Roadside Units (RSUs), and the highly viable, flexible and mature Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) technology for usage in vehicular pseudonymous communications. We successfully carried out a small-scale simulation of the proposed architecture using the Vehicles in Network Simulation (Veins) platform for integrated traffic and network simulation services (SUMO as the traffic simulator and OMNeT++ as the network simulator), and the Hyperledger Fabric platform as the permissioned consortium blockchain system.

Although, the current Electronic Medical Records (EMR) system has provided several advantages in handling patients' relevant information such as quick searching and eliminating duplicated records. However, the system is still facing the challenges of security concern particularly data manipulation issue that is considered a serious threat to data integrity. In fact, the application of blockchain technology overcomes data security problem by validating this issue based on smart contract supported with hash method of peer to peer network. This method has allowed the safe sharing of information across nodes and secures the transaction over networks through the accuracy of data transmission. Therefore, this paper aims to perform data transmission analysis of a smart contract-based hash validation method through peer to peer network (P2P). The analysis result shows that the data transmission is accurate and non-error in every node on P2P. When the number of peers and data size is increased, it has a greater effect on the processing latency. Each peer can act as both a server and a client. With 8 peers, maximum data size 2048 bytes, latency was 3,249 milliseconds which shows the latency does not increase more than the smaller data size. After that, we brought the questionnaire relating to our system to ask 34 people, the results show that 50% of them aware of the importance of medical data and 100% of data integrity.","2155-2509","978-1-7281-9127-0","10.1109/COMSNETS51098.2021.9352932","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9352932","Blockchain;Data Integrity;Electronic Medical Record;Hospital Emergency Ward;Peer to Peer","Hospitals;Data integrity;Smart contracts;Peer-to-peer computing;Data communication;Servers;Electronic medical records","blockchains;contracts;data integrity;health care;hospitals;medical information systems;patient treatment;peer-to-peer computing;records management;security of data","data transmission analysis;validation method;medical data;data integrity;hospital emergency ward;hospitals;electronic medical records system;security concern;data manipulation issue;data security problem;hash method;peer network;duplicated record elimination;patient relevenant information handling;blockchain-based electronic medical records management;smart contract-based hash validation;peer to peer network;P2P;memory size 2048.0 Byte;time 3249.0 ms","","1","","18","","17 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper shows that an unreliable coordinator may collude with some charging stations and behave dishonestly by disobeying the coordination algorithm. Thus, the collusion coalition can gain more profits while lowering the profits of others and the total social welfare. To provide reliable coordination of charging stations, a novel blockchain-based coordination platform via Ethereum is established, including a coordination structure and a smart contract. A mathematical analysis is given to show that the proposed platform can mitigate the collusion behaviors in the coordination.

As such, we propose a federated learning (FL) based approach to promote privacy-preserving collaborative machine learning for applications in smart industries. In our system model, a model owner initiates an FL task involving a group of workers, i.e., data owners, to perform model training on their locally stored data before transmitting the model updates for aggregation. There exists a tradeoff between service latency, i.e., the time taken for the training request to be completed, and age of information (AoI), i.e., the time elapsed between data aggregation from the deployed industrial Internet of Things devices to completion of the FL-based training. On one hand, if the data are collected only upon the model owner's request, the AoI is low. On the other hand, the service latency incurred is more significant. Furthermore, given that different training tasks may have varying AoI requirements, we propose a contract-theoretic task-aware incentive scheme that can be calibrated based on the weighted preferences of the model owner toward AoI and service latency. The performance evaluation validates the incentive compatibility of our contract amid information asymmetry, and shows the flexibility of our proposed scheme toward satisfying varying preferences of AoI and service latency.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2020.3046028","Alibaba Group through Alibaba Innovative Research; Alibaba-NTU Singapore Joint Research Institute; National Research Foundation Singapore; AI Singapore Programme; AISG(grant numbers:AISG-GC-2019-003); Singapore Energy Market Authority(grant numbers:NRF2017EWT-EP003-041,NRF2015-NRF-ISF001-2277); WASP/NTU(grant numbers:M4082187 (4080)); Ministry of Education - Singapore(grant numbers:RG16/20); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9300190","Age of information (AoI);contract theory;federated learning (FL);incentive mechanism;service latency","Data models;Training;Task analysis;Contracts;Agriculture;Data collection;Computational modeling","data aggregation;data privacy;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);production engineering computing","information freshness;federated learning based approach;privacy-preserving collaborative machine learning;FL task;data owners;data aggregation;industrial Internet of Things;FL-based training;AoI requirements;contract-theoretic task-aware incentive scheme;incentive compatibility;information asymmetry;age of information;service latency;smart industries","","3","","30","IEEE","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, consumers and merchants may have different perceptions of product quality, and this may result in business disputes. The dispute about buying inferior goods may be caused from simple product photos or merchants make over the top claims about their products. This dispute problem cannot be resolved completely, even though customers choose reputable e-commerce companies, e.g., Amazon.com and Alibaba.com. In the final analysis, the cause is that e-commerce companies do not adopt quality rating to evaluate products. If there is an alliance, among e-commerce companies and trusted organizations, which establishes credible product grading system (PGS), online shoppers may buy genuine product at a fair price from this e-commerce alliance. In this paper, we propose blockchain based PGS (BPGS) to deal with big data for this business model. The blockchain is a decentralized technology, and thus we can speed up the verification of product grading. In addition, for the proposed BPGS, 51% of attacks cannot be completed unless 51% of merchants and e-commerce companies in this alliance are simultaneously compromised.

However, the participation of centralized trusted third-party auditor (TPA) in most of the previous work has brought new security risks, because the TPA is prone to the single point of failure. Furthermore, the existing schemes do not consider the fair arbitration and lack an effective method to punish the malicious behavior. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel blockchain-based decentralized data integrity auditing scheme without the need for a centralized TPA. By using smart contract technique, our scheme supports automatic compensation mechanism. DO and CSP must first pay a certain amount of ether for the smart contract as deposit. The CSP gets the corresponding storage fee if the integrity auditing is passed. Otherwise, the CSP not only gets no fee but has to compensate DO whose data integrity is destroyed. Security analysis shows that the proposed scheme can resist a variety of attacks.

In addition, Supply-Business Contract Management (SCM) manages all CA and Node Communication (NC) allows communication over the network. The security analysis and evaluation prove the effectiveness of TrustedChain.","2375-9259","978-1-7281-9012-9","10.1109/ICDMW51313.2020.00128","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61902385); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of China(grant numbers:2019A1515011705,2018A030313943); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9346437","blockchain;data sharing;supply chain;smart contract","Supply chains;Smart contracts;Distributed databases;Blockchain;Stakeholders;Security;Data mining","blockchains;groupware;production engineering computing;supply chain management","trusted environment;TrustedChain;blockchain-based data sharing scheme;supply chain;sensitive order data;supply-business contract management;distributed database;contract account;node communication","","","","30","","16 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In smart grid, huge amounts of data generated by edge devices are collected by different parties. To achieve high operation efficiency, it is important to enable the data sharing and cooperative computation among different parties. How to protect the security and privacy of the utility data and the identities of their owners has become a major concern. There have been some studies on this issue. However, most of these works failed to consider the privacy protection in the dual sides of the data owner and receiver. In this paper, we propose BPM4SG, a Blockchain-based dual-side Privacy-preserving Multi-party computation scheme for edge-enabled Smart Grid. In BPM4SG, the data segmentation method is adopted to ensure the security of multi-party computation (e.g., summation) in edge nodes. The consortium blockchain and smart contract are used to further increase the system security and avoid the dependency on trusted third parties. Additionally, a data obfuscation method based on the ring signatures and a new one-time address scheme are proposed to protect the privacy of both the data owner and data receiver. The analysis shows that BPM4SG can meet the security and privacy requirements of smart grid. The experimental evaluation results demonstrate that our scheme has a better performance compared with other popular schemes.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3061107","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972148); Opening Project of Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Security Technology(grant numbers:2017B030314131); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality(grant numbers:4182060); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9360653","privacy preservation;secure multi-party computation;data analytics;blockchain;edge computing;smart grid.","Blockchain;Smart grids;Companies;Collaboration;Data privacy;Servers;Edge computing","","","","","","","IEEE","22 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The current practice assumes trust in service providers to acknowledge SLA breach incidents and executing associated consequences. Recently, the Blockchain paradigm has introduced compelling capabilities that may enable us to address SLA enforcement more elegantly. This paper proposes and implements a blockchain-based approach for assessing SLA compliance and enforcing consequences. It employs a diagnostic accuracy method for validating the dependability of the proposed solution.

In fact, a chaincode in the Fabric platform (the equivalent of the Ethereum smart contract) is a software program which encapsulates the business logic for the creation and modification of logical assets in the ledger that can be written in different general-purpose programming languages (currently Java, Go, and Node.js). This paper analyses the transaction performance of the Fabric platform by identifying at a fine-grained degree level the factors that most contribute to the overall overhead. In particular, we focus on how the transaction latency is affected by the programming language adopted for implementing the chaincode and by varying the number of participating endorser peers. Finally, the paper shows a thorough test assessment aimed at evaluating the impact of the different chaincode implementation on performance overhead.

To facilitate the easy exchanges of real-time IoT data streams between device owners and third-party applications, it is required to provide scalable, interoperable, and secured services for large numbers of distributed IoT devices operated by different application vendors. Thanks to decentralization, immutability, and auditability, Blockchain is promising to enable a tamper-proof and trust-free framework to enhance performance and security issues in centralized DMs. However, directly integrating blockchains into large-scale IoT-based DMs still faces many limitations, such as high resource and energy demands, low transaction throughput, poor scalability, and challenges in privacy preservation. This paper introduces a novel Federated Ledgers-based Framework for Hierarchical Decentralized Data Marketplaces (Fed-DDM). In Fed-DDM, participants are divided into multiple permissioned domains given their registrations. Each domain leverages an efficient Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus protocol to commit transactions of a domain on a private intra-ledger. A public inter-ledger network adopts a scalable Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus protocol to federate multiple private intra-ledger networks. We design a smart contract-enabled inter-ledger protocol to guarantee the security of the cross-domain operations on a public federated ledger without exposing sensitive privacy information from private ledgers. A proof-of-concept prototype is implemented, and the experimental results verify the feasibility of the proposed Fed-DDM solution with performance and security guarantees.","2637-9430","978-1-6654-1278-0","10.1109/ICCCN52240.2021.9522359","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9522359","IoT-based Data Marketplaces;Federated Ledger;Blockchain;Smart Contract;Security;Privacy","Privacy;Smart cities;Scalability;Prototypes;Throughput;Stability analysis;Real-time systems","blockchains;data privacy;fault tolerance;Internet of Things;protocols","smart cities;real-time IoT data streams;device owners;third-party applications;scalable secured services;secured services;distributed IoT devices;application vendors;immutability;trust-free framework;centralized DMs;blockchains;large-scale IoT-based DMs;multiple permissioned domains;Byzantine fault tolerance consensus protocol;public inter-ledger network;Proof-of-Work consensus protocol;multiple private intra-ledger networks;smart contract-enabled inter-ledger protocol;cross-domain operations;public federated ledger;private ledgers;Fed-DDM solution;Federated Ledgers-based Framework;hierarchical decentralized data marketplaces","","","","32","","31 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are many tools detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts trying to avoid potential attacks. However, we found that there are still many missed vulnerabilities in contracts. Motivated by this, we propose a methodology to reinforce EVM to stop dangerous transactions in real time even when the smart contract contains vulnerabilities. Basically, the methodology consists of three steps: monitoring strategy definition, opcode-structure maintenance and EVM instrumentation. Monitoring strategy definition refers to the specific rule to test whether there is a dangerous operation during transaction execution. Opcode-structure maintenance is to maintain a structure to store the rule related opcodes and analyze it before an operation execution. EVM instrumentation inserts the monitoring strategy, interrupting mechanism and the opcode-structure operations in EVM source code. For evaluation, we implement EVM<sup>*</sup> on js-evm, a widely-used EVM platform written in javascript. We collect 10 contracts online with known bugs and use each contract to execute a dangerous transaction, all of them have been interrupted by our reinforced EVM<sup>*</sup>, while the original EVM permits all attack transactions. For the time overhead, the reinforced EVM<sup>*</sup> is slower than the original one by 20-30%, which is tolerable for the financial critical applications.","1534-5351","978-1-7281-0591-8","10.1109/SANER.2019.8668038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8668038","Blockchain security;Ethereum;EVM defending","Monitoring;Computer bugs;Tools;Instruments;Smart contracts;Maintenance engineering","financial data processing;security of data;virtual machines","offline detection;vulnerabilities;smart contract;opcode-structure maintenance;EVM instrumentation;transaction execution;rule related opcodes;operation execution;opcode-structure operations;EVM source code;js-evm;EVM platform;Ethereum virtual machine;interrupting mechanism","","7","","16","","18 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Similar to cloud platforms, a single blockchain-based system may need to serve multiple tenants simultaneously. However, design of multi-tenant blockchain-based systems is challenging to architects in terms of data and performance isolation, as well as scalability. First, tenants must not be able to read other tenants' data and tenants with potentially higher workload should not affect read/write performance of other tenants. Second, multi-tenant blockchain-based systems usually require both scalability for each individual tenant and scalability with number of tenants. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a scalable platform architecture for multi-tenant blockchain-based systems to ensure data integrity while maintaining data privacy and performance isolation. In the proposed architecture, each tenant has an individual permissioned blockchain to maintain their own data and smart contracts. All tenant chains are anchored into a main chain, in a way that minimizes cost and load overheads. The proposed architecture has been implemented in a proof-of-concept prototype with our industry partner, Laava ID Pty Ltd (Laava). We evaluate our proposal in a three-fold way: fulfilment of the identified requirements, qualitative comparison with design alternatives, and quantitative analysis.

Traditionally, the centralized power transaction mode has high maintenance cost, low efficiency and untimely settlement. Therefore, it is hard to adapt to the high-frequency and small-scale distributed energy trading scenarios. To this end, this paper mainly proposes a distributed power trading method based on blockchain considering security constraints. The paper first reviews the development history of blockchain technology, and explores the theory of blockchain technology. At the same time, it combines the analysis of distributed energy features and summarizes some requirements for building a distributed energy trading market. Then the mechanism and model of distributed power trading considering security constraints are constructed. Finally, a distributed power trading method based on blockchain is proposed to ensure the transparency of transactions, and to provide smart contracts for distributed power multilateral transactions. Through the example of the Ethereum blockchain, the distributed power trading method based on blockchain proposed in this paper can realize the over-limit correction of power flow and the multilateral trading of power, and realize the digital management of electric energy.","","978-1-7281-2153-6","10.1109/CEC.2019.8790069","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8790069","blockchain;energy internet;ethereum;smart contracts;distributed energy","Blockchain;Power markets;Smart contracts;Distributed databases;Security;Market research;Power demand","cryptocurrencies;distributed databases;distributed power generation;load flow;power engineering computing;power generation dispatch;power generation economics;power markets;power system security","electric energy digital management;power multilateral trading;power flow;small-scale distributed energy trading market scenarios;Ethereum blockchain;smart contracts;high maintenance cost;distributed energy dispatch;security constraints;distributed systems;centralized power transaction mode;distributed energy penetration;power system reform;blockchain-enabled transactive method;distributed power multilateral transactions;distributed power trading method","","2","","13","","8 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the prevalence of the vehicular local advertising has raised increasing transparency and accountability concerns on the spatial keyword query process, such as why a vehicular user receives advertisements from specific spatial entities as well as the timely detection of the advertising misbehavior. In this paper, we develop a transparent and accountable vehicular local advertising system by utilizing the tamper-proof and open nature of the blockchain technology. Considering the large scale of the spatial-keyword database and the expensive computation and storage cost on the blockchain, we introduce two design strategies, digest-and-verify and divide-then-assemble. In specific, a large-scale spatial keyword database is digested and stored on the blockchain. The spatial keyword query is then conducted with modular executions of two off-chain spatial keyword query functions, the results of which are efficiently assembled and verified in an advertising smart contract. By doing so, expensive on-chain computation and storage overheads are significantly reduced at a cost of acceptable off-chain overheads. We define the security requirements of the vehicular local advertising system as Auditing Security and achieve the notion with the security analysis. We also conduct real-world experiments to show the efficiency of the blockchain-based vehicular local advertising system.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2020.3032375","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9234020","Vehicular local advertising;blockchain;smart contract;spatial keyword","Advertising;Blockchain;Spatial databases;Security;Query processing;Smart contracts;Computational modeling","advertising;query processing;vehicular ad hoc networks","blockchain-based vehicular local advertising system;advertising smart contract;off-chain spatial keyword query functions;large-scale spatial keyword database;spatial-keyword database;blockchain technology;accountable vehicular local advertising system;transparent advertising system;advertising misbehavior;specific spatial entities;vehicular user;spatial keyword query process;accountability concerns;transparency;on-road vehicular users;location-aware advertisements;practical blockchain designs","","2","","44","IEEE","20 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In 2018-19 alone, the Government of India spent $60 Bn on welfare subsidies, majorly through the Public Distribution System(PDS). Of this amount, it is estimated that 40% was lost in the form of misuse, corruption and related inefficiencies in the system. Recognising this problem, the government began Direct Benefit Transfers in 2013 for a select few schemes, for instance, LPG subsidy. Using Aadhaar and biometric tokens for validation, the beneficiaries would receive the subsidy as direct cash transfers to their bank accounts. However, in reality, the DBT program has had the same efficiency as the PDS. According to the analysis of the DBT policy, the key drawbacks of this system are lack of auditability, inability to control the use of funds for intended purposes, and over-reliance on the banking infrastructure, which is underdeveloped in the rural areas. In order to plug loopholes in the DBT system, we propose a blockchain-based system. Blockchain consists of cryptographic hash secured distributed ledgers which maintain an immutable log of transactions between all participants of a blockchain network. They have the ability to execute Smart Contracts, which allow for automation of execution of real-world contracts given that certain specified conditions are met. Appropriating the Governments Aadhaar UID, we aim to develop a smart blockchain which automates the disbursement of subsidy which bypasses the need for banks in rural nodes while creating an auditable and transparent ecosystem to curb corruption and financial mismanagement.","","978-1-7281-6221-8","10.1109/INCET49848.2020.9154178","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9154178","blockchain;smart contracts;governance;subsidies;direct cash transfer;disintermediation","Government;Contracts;Information technology;Electronic mail;Banking","banking;biometrics (access control);contracts;cryptography;electronic money;financial data processing;government policies;Internet;public administration;public finance;security of data","direct cash transfers;bank accounts;DBT program;DBT policy;key drawbacks;banking infrastructure;DBT system;blockchain-based system;cryptographic hash secured distributed ledgers;blockchain network;Governments Aadhaar UID;smart blockchain;Direct Benefit transfer System;subsidy delivery;deserving beneficiaries;government expenditure;$60 Bn;welfare subsidies;corruption;related inefficiencies;Direct Benefit Transfers;select few schemes;LPG subsidy;biometric tokens","","","","21","","3 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Charging EVs has imposed new loads on power systems. These new and major loads along with the deregulation of power systems, which introduces new uncertainties to grid, have caused new challenges for the frequency control and stability of power systems. Use of EVs as moving batteries is one of the ways for dealing with this problem. In this method, EV charging is controlled and, when necessary, EV battery is discharged in grid. This concept is so-called vehicle to grid (V2G). V2G concept is employed in this paper for the control of a smart deregulated grid frequency. For this purpose, an optimized fuzzy controller is used to control EVs. Using the proposed method, charging or discharging batteries is carried out with respect to grid frequency and battery state of charge. To investigate the proposed approach, a modified IEEE 39-bus system in the presence of renewable energy resources is assumed. Then, this system is converted into a three area system in order for the frequency analysis. Investigating the performance of the proposed method for the charging of EVs is done in another part of paper. Simulations are carried out in MATLAB/SIMULINK environment and their results illustrate good performance of the proposed method in the frequency control of deregulated system and EV charging.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2016.2575061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7486139","Smart grid;deregulated grid;vehicle to grid;fuzzy control;renewable energy","Frequency control;Batteries;Power system stability;Renewable energy sources;Charging stations;Contracts","battery powered vehicles;electric vehicle charging;frequency control;fuzzy control;renewable energy sources;vehicle-to-grid","smart deregulated grid frequency control;renewable energy resources;fossil fuels;environmental pollutions;electric vehicles;power systems;EV charging;EV battery;discharging batteries;modified IEEE 39-bus system;frequency analysis;deregulated system;charging control","","11","","19","IEEE","7 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It has since been extended to numerous other applications including execution of programs that exist on the blockchain called “smart contracts.” Smart contracts have a major limitation, namely they only operate on data that is on the blockchain. Trusted entities called oracles attest to external data in order to bring it onto the blockchain but they do so without the robust security guarantees that blockchains generally provide. This has the potential to turn oracles into centralized points-of-failure. To address this concern, this paper introduces Astraea, a decentralized oracle based on a voting game that decides the truth or falsity of propositions. Players fall into two roles: voters and certifiers. Voters play a low-risk/low-reward role that is resistant to adversarial manipulation while certifiers play a high-risk/high-reward role so they are required to play with a high degree of accuracy. This paper also presents a formal analysis of the parameters behind the system to measure the probability of an adversary with bounded funds being able to successfully manipulate the oracle's decision, that shows that the same parameters can be set to make manipulation arbitrarily difficult-a desirable feature for the system. Further, this analysis demonstrates that under those conditions a Nash equilibrium exists where all rational players are forced to behave honestly.","","978-1-5386-7975-3","10.1109/Cybermatics_2018.2018.00207","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8726819","blockchain;Ethereum;oracle;voting","Blockchain;Smart contracts;Games;Bitcoin;Peer-to-peer computing","cryptography;electronic money;game theory;peer-to-peer computing;probability","Astraea;decentralized blockchain oracle;public blockchain;peer-to-peer network;smart contracts;external data;robust security guarantees;decentralized oracle;low-risk/low-reward role;high-risk/high-reward role;voting game;Nash equilibrium","","26","","34","","3 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A large number of security risks are involved. The existing security mechanisms are not easy to manage because they require extra resources and thus, increase the overall cost of the system. The IoT devices are resource-limited devices and they do not perform many computation. The services requested from the IoT devices may be malicious and may have severe consequences when they are not being tackled by any efficient security mechanism. The reliability of the services is an important aspect of the IoT network. Blockchain provides a solution that is secure and effective in terms of reliability and cost. We have proposed a system model through which we protect the IoT devices from unreliable services. These services are provided by cloud service providers. The proposed system allows IoT devices to know about the ratings of the service providers before requesting the service. Smart contracts are introduced to store ratings of the service providers into the blockchain. IoT devices invoke the smart contract to acquire ratings of the service providers by providing service codes. Performance analysis and the experimental results show that the proposed model protects the IoT devices from unreliable services in a reasonable time and affordable cost.","","978-1-7281-5061-1","10.1109/ITT48889.2019.9075109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9075109","Blockchain;Services;Smart Contract;Internet of Things;Ethereum","Contracts;Servers;Reliability;Internet of Things;Cloud computing","cloud computing;Internet of Things;security of data","IoT devices;unreliable services;cloud service providers;reliable services;blockchain;Internet of Things devices;smart contracts;service codes;performance analysis","","","","13","","23 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The B2B platform builds upon three ideas. The first is to use a permissioned blockchain with smart contracts as the technical infrastructure for building the platform. Second, the above smart contracts implement deep business logic which is derived using a rigorous analysis of a repeated game model of the strategic interactions between buyers and sellers to devise strategies to induce honest behavior from buyers and sellers. Third, we present a formal framework that captures the essential requirements for secure and private B2B collaboration, and, in this direction, we develop cryptographic regulation protocols that, in conjunction with the blockchain, help implement such a framework.

This paper puts forward a reinforcement-learning-powered tool aiding an electricity retailer to define the tariff prices it offers, in a bid to optimise its retail strategy. In a competitive market, an energy retailer aims to simultaneously increase the number of contracted customers and its profit margin. We have abstracted the problem of deciding on a tariff price as faced by a retailer, as a semi-Markov decision problem (SMDP). A hierarchical reinforcement learning approach, MaxQ value function decomposition, is applied to solve the SMDP through interactions with the market. To evaluate our trading strategy, we developed a retailer agent (termed AstonTAC) that uses the proposed SMDP framework to act in an open multi-agent simulation environment, the Power Trading Agent Competition (Power TAC). An evaluation and analysis of the 2013 Power TAC finals show that AstonTAC successfully selects sell prices that attract as many customers as necessary to maximise the profit margin. Moreover, during the competition, AstonTAC was the only retailer agent performing well across all retail market settings.","2165-4824","978-1-4799-7720-8","10.1109/ISGTEurope.2014.7028942","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7028942","","Games;Pricing;Electricity;Abstracts;Decision making;Educational institutions;Smart grids","decision theory;demand side management;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;multi-agent systems;power markets;power system simulation;pricing;profitability;smart power grids;tariffs","market share optimization;profit margin optimization;SMDP-based tariff pricing;smart grid technology;decentralised electricity market;liberalised electricity market;demand side;demand response;pricing signals;reinforcement-learning-powered tool;electricity retailer;energy retailer;semiMarkov decision problem;hierarchical reinforcement learning approach;MaxQ value function decomposition;trading strategy;retailer agent;AstonTAC;open multiagent simulation environment;power trading agent competition;power TAC;retail market","","2","","14","","2 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is also essential to combine cybersecurity within the SCMS. In an effort to move towards smart grid, the Dubai Electricity & Water Authority (DEWA) initiated a long-term contract for the supply, installation, testing, and commissioning of 33 substations (132/11 kV) with modern automation systems for transmission power substations. DEWA has very strict requirements in terms of system availability, reliability, performance, cybersecurity, Ethernet network resiliency, and protection and communications redundancy. An HMI is included in the SCMS for local indication and control. Status, metering, and control data to the local HMI and remote utility enterprise system is provided by a redundant SCADA system. Reliable and secure communications to support mission-critical, high-speed protection schemes is achieved by an Ethernet network of utility-grade operational technology (OT) switches, not IT switches. The Ethernet network uses a modified ladder topology with IEC 62439 Part 1 Spanning Tree Algorithm (STA) via Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) for network resiliency and IEC 62439 Part 3 Parallel Redundancy Protocol (PRP) for message duplication. Data segregation and traffic control in the SCMS network is provided by IEEE 802.1 VLANs. The data acquisition and control along with engineering access and event report collection is accomplished using manufacturing message specification (MMS), whereas high-speed signal exchange for peer-to-peer protection schemes is accomplished using GOOSE communications protocols from the IEC 61850 communications standard. The DEWA technical SCMS specifications were built around the concept of future proofing and backward compatibility to support the evolution of smart grid capabilities by accepting smart technological advancements and future development of substation automation system features. It is strongly believed that the technical improvements made in DEWA specifications will lay a solid foundation for a sustainable automation system in DEWA over the years to come. Because DEWA is aware of the risks of digitizing substation communications networks and the recent increase in the number of cyberattacks against utilities that involve abusing vulnerabilities in the security of their communications networks, DEWA has strict cybersecurity requirements to prevent cyberinduced power outages that could potentially disrupt an electric power grid. The SCMS was designed with the holistic approach of a defense-in-depth philosophy, including supply chain security and physical security. The DEWA SCMS security design relies on a multilayer security zone approach to provide a scalable cybersecurity solution that automates tasks, streamlines operations, and improves performance. This paper discusses DEWA system requirements developed to facilitate the safe, reliable, and economical delivery of power in Emirate of Dubai. This is followed by a discussion of various engineering decisions that resulted from lessons learned during the design stage of the DEWA transmission power substation automation system to ensure that the system is ready for future smart grid requirements. Various analysis tools and testing techniques are described in the paper that were used to quantify the performance attributes of the IEC 61850-based system design. This project proves that with the right engineering design and a properly configured Ethernet network that uses best engineering practices for OT, performance, interoperability, and compliance to standards can coexist.","","978-1-5386-1876-9","10.1109/SASG.2017.8356501","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8356501","","IEC Standards;Protocols;Interoperability;Substations;Reliability;Testing","IEC standards;local area networks;open systems;power engineering computing;power system control;power system reliability;SCADA systems;smart power grids;substations;telecommunication network topology;trees (mathematics)","transmission power substations;substation control;DEWA technical SCMS specifications;smart grid capabilities;smart technological advancements;substation automation system features;DEWA specifications;sustainable automation system;substation communications networks;strict cybersecurity requirements;cyberinduced power outages;electric power grid;supply chain security;DEWA SCMS security design;multilayer security zone approach;scalable cybersecurity solution;system design;IEC 61850 communications;GOOSE communications protocols;peer-to-peer protection schemes;high-speed signal exchange;message specification;event report collection;data acquisition;SCMS network;traffic control;IEC 62439 Part 3 Parallel Redundancy Protocol;IEC 62439 Part 1 Spanning Tree Algorithm;utility-grade operational technology;high-speed protection schemes;redundant SCADA system;remote utility enterprise system;local HMI;communications redundancy;Ethernet network resiliency;system availability;modern automation systems;Dubai Electricity & Water Authority;entire substation automation applications;multiple communications protocols;digitally connected devices;Ethernet network;voltage 132.0 kV;voltage 11.0 kV","","","","9","","10 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We introduce a new computing paradigm, named by Vehicular Parked-Edge Computing (VPEC). We formulate a three-stage contract-stackelberg offloading incentive mechanism to describe this problem. The PLs are classified into different types according to their idle computational resources, and parking lot agent (PLA) offers different contracts to different types of PLs. The optimal problem is designed to maximize the utilities of vehicles, operator and PLA.

We consider the existing contractual framework in which a regulation unit declares its regulation parameters at the beginning of the contract, the operator guarantees that the regulation signals will be within the range of these parameters, and the regulation unit is rewarded proportionally to what it declares. Our purpose is twofold. We first want to obtain formulas for the regulation parameters that a unit with non-ideal storage should declare to the operator given its state of charge at the beginning of a contract. Second, we want to analytically quantify, ahead of time, the reward that such a unit could obtain in successive contracts by performing this regulation service. Since the state of charge at the beginning of a contract depends on what happened in the previous contract and, hence, is a random variable, we quantify this reward analytically using bounds and expectation. We then provide engineering insights by applying our results to three specific energy storage technologies that are often considered as candidates for regulation. In particular, we show the impact of the storage parameters and the length of one contract on the potential reward over a given period.","","978-1-4799-4934-2","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2014.7007628","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7007628","","Contracts;System-on-chip;Approximation methods;Discharges (electric);Lead;Flywheels;Batteries","battery management systems;contracts;load regulation;power system control;secondary cells","power system;regulation service;system supply;system load;regulation signals;regulation unit;regulation parameters;energy storage technologies","","4","","11","","15 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This work potentially can solve some of the existing challenges with the current centralized application approval process by Apple and Google. These companies currently charge a flat commission rate of 30% [1] of the total applications revenues from the applications owners. This commission is considered to be very high, especially for applications with revenues in the order of few million dollars. In addition, the length of the review period prior to deployment for any new or revised apps delays the release to the marketplace hence costing economic losses to the app owners. Currently, Apple and Google stores takes around two days and two hours respectively to review and approve the apps on their stores. However, by using decentralized technologies such as the blockchain, the time to review and publish a new or a revised app can be significantly reduced from few days to few minutesIn this paper a novel framework is proposed based on the blockchain architecture incorporating the Ethereum network, Interplanetary Files System (IPFS), VueJS, and a backend database. The framework is experimentally validated, and the results show the reduction in terms of the number of minutes to approve apps by the app stores.","","978-1-7281-6544-8","10.1109/CITS49457.2020.9232506","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9232506","Smart Contracts;Blockchain;IPFS;Secured and Decentralized Applications;Ethereum Ropsten and Rinkeby testnets;Vuejs;web3js;and Graphql","Blockchain;Smart contracts;System analysis and design;Smart phones;Publishing;Libraries;File systems","cryptography;mobile computing","revised app;blockchain architecture;Interplanetary Files System;app stores;decentralized applications deployment System;secured decentralized applications store;approval time;mobile platforms;Apple;Google play stores;flat commission rate;applications owners;decentralized technologies;total application revenues;centralized application approval process;Ethereum network;VueJS;backend database","","","","14","","20 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the data in such systems suffer from various challenges such as security, reliability, and convenience, to name a few. Traditional systems are not useful to meet these critical issues because these systems have not a consistent structure for data security and reliability policies. Therefore, a new solution is required to enhance data accessibility and should regulate government security policies to ensure the accountability of the usage of the medical records system. Moreover, it is also required to analyze historical data of veterinary clinic using data mining and machine learning techniques to predict the future appointments scheduling requests, which is essential for veterinary management to drive better future decisions, for instance, future demands of medical supplies and to plan veterinary medical staff, etc. This paper aims to fill the gap by proposing a novel blockchain-based reliable and intelligent veterinary information management system (RIVIMS) using smart contract and machine learning techniques. The proposed RIVIMS consists of two main modules; blockchain-based secured veterinary information management, data and predictive analytics modules. First, a blockchain-based secure and reliable veterinary clinic information management system is developed using Hyperledger Fabric. Second, a smart contract enabled data, and predictive analytics modules are developed using permissioned blockchain framework. The data and predictive modules aim to analyze veterinary clinic patients appointments data in order to discover underlying patterns and build a robust prediction model using machine learning algorithms. The data and predictive helps veterinary management to drive better future business decisions to provide better healthcare services to veterinary patients. Hyperledger Caliper is used as a benchmark tool to evaluate the performance of the developed blockchain-based system in terms of transaction per second, transaction success rate, transaction throughput, and transaction latency. Furthermore, machine learning performance measures have utilized, such as MAE, RMSE, and R2 score to evaluate the overall performance of the prediction model.

We first develop a data analytic platform to collect external transactions associated with users as well as internal transactions initiated by smart contracts. Three types of temporal graphs, user-to-user, contract-to-contract, and user-contract graphs, are constructed according to trading relationships and are segmented with an appropriate time window. We observe a strong correlation between the size of the user-to-user transaction graph and the average Ether price in a time window, while no evidence of such linkage is shown at the average degree, average edge weights, and average triplet closure duration. The macroscopic and microscopic burstiness of Ethereum transactions are validated.

This is due to the nature of IoT devices which use lighter protocols and which may be either hacked or physically tampered with. Thus, common approaches for threat modelling are insufficient on IoT environments, since they hardly catch all possible threats related to physical and protocols vulnerabilities. Furthermore, in IoT scenarios multiple parties can be involved, like in a transactive energy scenario, where nodes of the network can trade energy each other. So, it is important to catch risks that an attack may lead to each involved party. In this work, we propose a novel approach to model (i) the process list of a system and (ii) attacks towards it. Specifically, we extended the PROV-N semantic notation by including rules for modelling the attacks. We apply such modelling to ETSE [12], the architecture we proposed in the context of the PETRAS BlockIT project to enable energy trading among prosumers. ETSE manages the trading through a smart contract deployed on top of a blockchain distributed on the grid. Since in this context multiple parties are involved, we discuss possible issues that each attack may bring to the entire smart grid or to a specific prosumer.","","978-1-83953-089-0","10.1049/cp.2019.0147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9038011","IoT security;blockchain;smart meter;smart contract;transactive energy","","","","","","","","","19 Mar 2020","","","IET","IET Conferences"

However, the on-demand use of energy is considered a big challenge to achieve the optimal cost for households. This paper proposes a blockchain-based predictive energy trading platform to provide real-time support, day-ahead controlling, and generation scheduling of distributed energy resources. The proposed blockchain-based platform consists of two modules; blockchain-based energy trading and smart contract enabled predictive analytics modules. The blockchain module allows peers with real-time energy consumption monitoring, easy energy trading control, reward model, and unchangeable energy trading transaction logs. The smart contract enabled predictive analytics module aims to build a prediction model based on historical energy consumption data to predict short-term energy consumption. This paper uses real energy consumption data acquired from the Jeju province energy department, the Republic of Korea. This study aims to achieve optimal power flow and energy crowdsourcing, supporting energy trading among the consumer and prosumer. Energy trading is based on day-ahead, real-time control, and scheduling of distributed energy resources to meet the smart grid’s load demand. Moreover, we use data mining techniques to perform time-series analysis to extract and analyze underlying patterns from the historical energy consumption data. The time-series analysis supports energy management to devise better future decisions to plan and manage energy resources effectively. To evaluate the proposed predictive model’s performance, we have used several statistical measures, such as mean square error and root mean square error on various machine learning models, namely recurrent neural networks and alike. Moreover, we also evaluate the blockchain platform’s effectiveness through hyperledger calliper in terms of latency, throughput, and resource utilization.

Moreover, FL is feasible for scenarios (e.g., autonomous cars) where an enormous amount of data is generated every day. Transferring only local model updates in the case of FL is highly communication-efficient compared to transferring all data in the case of centralized machine learning (ML). Although FL offers many advantages, it also has some challenges. A malicious aggregation server can infer device information via local model updates. Another downside of FL is the centralized aggregation server that can malfunction due to an attack or physical damage. To address these issues, we propose a novel Structured Transparency empowered cross-silo Federated Learning on the Blockchain (ST-BFL) framework. In ST-BFL, homomorphic encryption, FL-aggregators, FL-verifiers, and smart contract are employed, which satisfy various structured transparency components, such as input privacy, output privacy, output verification, and flow governance. We present the framework architecture, algorithms, and sequence diagram of our ST-BFL framework to show how different entities interact in ST-BFL for the FL process. We also present a simplified class diagram of ST-BFL’s smart contract for an FL task. Finally, we perform a simulation to analyze our framework from the perspective of aggregation time, accuracy, and storage size. The qualitative and quantitative evaluation shows that ST-BFL has the same accuracy as traditional FL. However, ST-BFL provides input privacy, output privacy, input verification, output verification, and flow governance at the expense of relatively higher computation and communication costs than traditional FL.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3128622","Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP); Korean Government through the MSIT (Evolvable Deep Learning Model Generation Platform for Edge Computing)(grant numbers:2019-0-01287); Korea Institute of Energy Technology Evaluation and Planning (KETEP); Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) of the Republic of Korea(grant numbers:20209810400030); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9617624","Blockchain;Ethereum;federated learning;flow governance;homomorphic encryption;input privacy;input verification;output privacy;output verification;smart contract;structured transparency","Smart contracts;Privacy;Servers;Computational modeling;Blockchains;Collaborative work;Task analysis","","","","","","53","CCBYNCND","16 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to address this issue, based on the game theory and a smart contract, we construct three protocols. The client and the calculator sign the Prisoner's Protocol to incentivize correct computation by asking the calculator to pay a deposit upfront; The client and the verifier sign the Long-acting Mechanism Protocol to ensure the validity of the verification results; The calculator and the verifier sign the Collusion Protocol to make collusion the most profitable strategy for all colluding parties. Through the combination of these protocols, the work is realized by separation the computing task and the verification task, and the heavy verification task is avoided.

There are three companies involved in the research. First is an energy technology company that aims to leverage electric- vehicle batteries through vehicle to grid (V2G) services in order to provide energy storage for electric grids. Second is a defense contracting company that provides acquisition support for the DOD's conventional prompt global strike program (CPGS). These systems need protections in their production and supply chains, as well as throughout their system life cycles. Third is a company that deals with trust and security in advanced logistics systems generally. The rise of interconnected devices has led to growth in systems security issues such as privacy, authentication, and secure storage of data. A risk analysis via scenario-based preferences is aided by a literature review and industry experts. The analysis is divided into various sections of Criteria, Initiatives, C-I Assessment, Emergent Conditions (EC), Criteria-Scenario (C-S) relevance and EC Grouping. System success criteria, research initiatives, and risks to the system are compiled. In the C-I Assessment, a rating is assigned to signify the degree to which criteria are addressed by initiatives, including research and development, government programs, industry resources, security countermeasures, education and training, etc. To understand risks of emergent conditions, a list of Potential Scenarios is developed across innovations, environments, missions, populations and workforce behaviors, obsolescence, adversaries, etc. The C-S Relevance rates how the scenarios affect the relevance of the success criteria, including cost, schedule, security, return on investment, and cascading effects. The Emergent Condition Grouping (ECG) collates the emergent conditions with the scenarios. The generated results focus on ranking Initiatives based on their ability to negate the effects of Emergent Conditions, as well as producing a disruption score to compare a Potential Scenario's impacts to the ranking of Initiatives. The results presented in this paper are applicable to the testing and evaluation of security and risk for a variety of embedded smart devices and should be of interest to developers, owners, and operators of critical infrastructure systems.","","978-1-6654-1250-6","10.1109/SIEDS52267.2021.9483779","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9483779","Hypersonics;Bidirectional Charging;Trust and Security;Electric Vehicle Charging;Enterprise Resilience;Risk Register;Systems Integration","Industries;Training;Vehicle-to-grid;Technological innovation;Supply chains;Companies;Security","critical infrastructures;decision making;defence industry;electric vehicle charging;embedded systems;goods distribution;logistics;military computing;power engineering computing;power grids;production engineering computing;risk analysis;risk management;security of data;telecommunication security","C-S relevance rates;ECG;leverage electric-vehicle batteries;DOD conventional prompt global strike program;criteria-scenario;emergent condition grouping;potential scenario impacts;ranking Initiatives;security countermeasures;research initiatives;system success criteria;emergent conditions;industry experts;literature review;scenario-based preferences;risk analysis;systems security issues;interconnected devices;system life cycles;supply chains;defense contracting company;electric grids;energy storage;grid services;energy technology company;embedded systems;risk management;advanced logistics systems;embedded smart devices;critical infrastructure systems","","","","28","","16 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The optical fiber was embedded in a garment and controlled displacements at predefined locations on the garment were applied, where the simultaneous assessment of displacement amplitude and location was obtained using a slope-assisted technique. In the proposed technique, the slope inverses of the transmission-reflection curves are correlated with the displacement applied on the fiber, where a determination coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>) of 0.996 was obtained. Then, the sloped-normalized reflection (or backscattered) response is used on the disturbance location estimation with relative errors as low as 3.7%. The on-body application tests show an inherent insensitivity of the proposed smart garment to body movement due to natural gait movements, indicating the feasibility of the proposed approach on detecting only the transverse induced mechanical perturbations. In the wearable tests, the sensor system shows high correlation (R<sup>2</sup> higher than 0.98) in the tests with different volunteers (subjected to similar displacements at predefined locations) and millimeter-accuracy on the disturbance location estimation.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2020.3024242","Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa e Inovação do Espírito Santo (FAPES)(grant numbers:84336650); National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)(grant numbers:304049/2019-0,408480/2018-1); Petrobras(grant numbers:2017/00702-6); national funds (OE), through FCT, I.P., “in the scope of the framework contract foreseen in the numbers 4, 5 and 6 of the article 23, of the Decree-Law 57/2016, of August 29, changed by Law 57/2017, of July 19;”; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(grant numbers:ANR-17-CE08-0002); BenchBalance European Union (EU) Project(grant numbers:EU-H2020-779963-FSTP1-BenchBalance); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT) through the (iFish project)(grant numbers:CEECIND/00034/2018); national funds through the FCT/MEC through the scope of the project i3N(grant numbers:UIDB/50025/2020,UIDP/50025/2020); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9197623","Distributed optical fiber sensors;gait perturbation;transmission-reflection analysis;particle-containing glasses","Optical fiber sensors;Optical fibers;Perturbation methods;Optical reflection","clothing;distributed sensors;erbium;fibre optic sensors;gait analysis;magnesium;nanoparticles;wearable sensors","fully-portable smart garment;mechanical perturbation detection;nanoparticles optical fibers;wearable smart textile;distributed optical fiber sensor system;transmission-reflection analysis;scattering medium;spatial resolution;displacement amplitude;slope-assisted technique;transmission-reflection curves;sloped-normalized reflection;disturbance location estimation;on-body application tests;body movement;natural gait movements;wearable tests;magnesium-erbium co-doped optical fiber;determination coefficient;transverse induced mechanical perturbations","","3","","39","IEEE","15 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As an important aspect of collaboration mechanism, conventional resource trading (RT) among MDs relies on an onsite interaction process, i.e., price negotiation between service providers and requesters, which, however, inevitably incurs excessive latency and degrades RT efficiency. To overcome this challenge, this paper adopts the concept of futures contract (FC) used in financial market, and proposes a smart futures for low latency RT. This new technique enables MDs to form trading coalitions and negotiate multilateral forward contracts applied to a collaboration term in the future. To maximize the benefits of self-interested MDs, the negotiation process of FC is modelled as a coalition formation game comprised of three components executed in an iterative manner, i.e., futures resource allocation, revenue sharing and payment allocation, and distributed decision-making of individual MD. Additionally, a FC enforcement scheme is implemented to efficiently manage the onsite resource sharing via recording resource balances of different task-types and MDs. Simulation results prove the superiority of smart futures in RT latency reduction and trading fairness provisioning.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2021.3060343","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9357934","Smart futures;coalition formation game;resource trading;task offloading;real-time data processing","Task analysis;Resource management;Real-time systems;Internet of Things;Collaboration;Decision making;Privacy","","","","","","","IEEE","18 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The SG requires real-time management of dynamic load to maintain the quality of service (i.e., balance between supply and demand) by interfacing with users. In this paper, we propose an approach to respond to the active demand (AD) based on user-defined energy-management policy. An algorithm is also proposed for the smart-controller device (SCD) modeled with the load aggregator and connected to the customers. The total contracted load and the user ADs are determined based on area, load, and phase classification, which specify the individual energy consumption. The proposed scheme is implemented in MATLAB/Simulink using the load-information of the IEEE 30-bus system, and the feasibility is assessed in IEEE 13 and IEEE 34 node test feeder systems. By applying the customer's controlled SCD device both the deficiency and redundancy of generation in terms of grid controllable load have been improved that lead the maximization of generation and distribution services. The voltage regulation and power factor of the particular area have been enhanced by integrating appropriate distributed generation and power factor improvement devices.

As consensus is impossible in the general case, it seems that these blockchain systems require messages are delivered fast and no participant mines faster than the crowd. To date, no experimental settings have however been proposed to demonstrate this hypothesis. In this paper, we identify conditions under which these blockchain systems fail to ensure consensus and present a reproducible execution on our Ethereum private chain. To this end, we introduce the Blockchain Anomaly, the impossibility for the blockchain to guarantee that a committed transaction is not abortable. This anomaly may translate into dramatic consequences for the user of proof-of-work blockchains. Named after the infamous Paxos anomaly, this anomaly makes dependent transactions, like “Bob sends money to Carole after he received money from Alice” impossible and may lead to double spending. We also explain how the anomaly differs from a 51-percent attack and how one could avoid it by adapting the Ethereum implementation or by exploiting smart contracts.","","978-1-5090-3216-7","10.1109/NCA.2016.7778635","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7778635","Ethereum;Paxos anomaly;smart contract","Indexes;Online banking;Contracts;Protocols;Cryptography;Transient analysis;Delays","security of data","smart contracts;Paxos anomaly;proof-of-work blockchains;blockchain systems;blockchain anomaly","","46","","31","","12 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

EMRs are owned and maintained by hospital systems. So, patients often face difficulties in getting their data shared among different stakeholders. Blockchain provides distributed, transparent, and immutable log of records that benefit the design of healthcare systems. There have been several studies done to use Blockchain technology as a mediation tool for sharing sensitive EMRs between multiple stakeholders in the e-health care system. However, these studies lack the requirement of patients to have full control over their EMR data. This work develops PACEX, PAtient-Centric EMR eXchange, that enables patients to share and have complete control over their data using Blockchain. In PACEX, we develop an easy-to-use patient application that interacts with different hospital systems and handles EMR exchanges with integrity. We developed a proof of concept implementation of PACEX using Ethereum Blockchain and Smart Contracts to achieve access control and maintain a history of record exchanges among different stakeholders. The evaluation results provide the quantitative analysis that gives time estimates for various transactions involved in PACEX and the qualitative analysis that describes the security properties of the system.

In order to avoid such impacts, peer to peer (P2P) electricity transactions among prosumers based on the blockchain and the smart contract technology and introduction of residence-use stationary storage battery are attracting great attentions. In this paper, the potential economical merits of P2P transactions and residential storage battery introduction are evaluated. The potential economic merit is evaluated by means of a total optimization approach.

Once a physical component is in operation, a DT can be used for configuration, monitoring, diagnostics, and prognostics. It is expected that DTs will gain significant attention in the foreseeable future, and will play a key role in Industry 4.0.

The companies that get low score reviews are induced to raise their score for the market competition capability by paying to the platform for deleting or editing the posted reviews. Moreover, the automatic filtration system of a platform removes some reviews without the awareness of the users. The low transparency platform causes low credibility toward the reviews. Blockchain technology provides exceptionally high transparency since every action can be traced publicly. However, there are some tradeoffs that need to be considered, such as cost and response time. This work tends to find the potential of using Blockchain technology in the online review system by testing four implementation approaches of the Ethereum Smart Contract. The result illustrates that using IPFS to store the data is a practical way of reducing transaction costs. Besides, preventing using Smart Contract states can significantly reduce costs too. The response time for using the Blockchain and IPFS system is slower than the centralized system. However, posting a review does not need a fast response. Thus, it is worthy of trading response time with transparency and cost. In the business view, the review posting with cost causes more difficulty to generate fake reviews. Moreover, there are other advantages over the centralized system, such as the reward system, bogus review voting, and global database. Thus, credibility improvement for a consumer online review system is a potential application of Blockchain technology.","","978-1-7281-6486-1","10.1109/ECTI-CON49241.2020.9158212","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9158212","Online Review;Blockchain;Ethereum;Smart Contract;IPFS","Contracts;Time factors;Peer-to-peer computing;Testing","cryptocurrencies;cryptography;distributed databases;electronic commerce","consumer online review system;performance analysis;low credibility;low transparency platform;automatic filtration system;posted reviews;low score reviews;trustworthy online review system;Blockchain technology;bogus review voting;reward system;fake reviews;response time;centralized system;IPFS system","","1","","10","","4 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, several challenges such as trusted traceability, certification for quality compliance, and protecting intellectual property need to be addressed. Blockchain-based distributed ledgers provide tremendous advantages for product traceability and ensure trust among participating stakeholders. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution for product traceability produced using additive manufacturing, guaranteeing secure and trusted traceability, accessibility, and immutability of transactions, and data provenance among supply chain stakeholders. Our proposed solution utilizes Ethereum smart contracts to govern and trace transactions initiated by participants involved in the manufacturing process.

However, in practice, the different assets that make up ME-CPS are operated by independent entities with different objectives and perspectives in mind. A new methodology is introduced that puts the stakeholders at the center of the design process by assuming that the system will be correctly designed and operated if all stakeholders reach a common agreement using formal contracts, which can be simulated for verification and validation before signature. Models are used to structure the relationships between stakeholders at all stages of the systems lifecycle: formal contracts are derived from high-level goals and are verified using “digital twins” that include requirement models and behavioral models. This new method was applied within a research project at EDF Lab to coordinate stakeholders for the renovation of a district to make it greener and smarter. Two scenarios were simulated revealing disagreements between stakeholders, and that satisfying ambitious key performance indicators (KPIs) is not an easy task requiring careful cooperation between actors.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2021.3071231","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9420455","Codesign methodology;formal contracts;high-level goals;model-based;modeling;multienergy cyber-physical systems (ME-CPSs);simulation;stakeholders","Stakeholders;Contracts;Solid modeling;Task analysis;Requirements engineering;Computational modeling;Complex systems","","","","","","","IEEE","3 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Therefore, this research aims to conduct an empirical study to evaluate the performance of two prominent Blockchain platforms, Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum. The performance evaluation is based on measuring four metrics including success rate, average latency, throughput, and resource consumption. The experimental results of executing 100 transactions show that Hyperledger Fabric generally surpasses Ethereum against the four performance metrics.

However, drawbacks to these marketplaces include the platform's ability to block merchants at their own whim, the fees paid to the platform when listing a product and when selling a product, and the lack of privacy of users' data. In this paper, we propose an application that remedies all three of these drawbacks through use of the Ethereum blockchain platform. The application was developed using the Truffle development framework. The application's functions were contained within an Ethereum smart contract, which was then migrated to the Ethereum network. The user's input was read through a web interface and sent to the Ethereum network via the web3.js API. Statistics about the application were gathered on the Rinkeby test network. The application was shown to have an average transaction runtime of 3.8 seconds, and an average gas consumption of 4.6 wei. Contract creation times for the application were shown to be less than a second. A cost analysis of the application was then conducted. The gas consumption of the transactions needed to both buy and sell a product was converted into US dollars, and the gas cost of the application was then compared to the cost to use an online auction marketplace such as eBay as well as an in-person auction house such as Sotheby's. The results showed that selling on the application is cheaper than existing online options as well as existing in-person options. These tests showed that our application was successful in addressing the drawbacks of current auction marketplaces.","","978-1-5386-9502-9","10.1109/CIC.2018.00023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8537821","blockchain;Ethereum;marketplace;smart contract;decentralized;cryptocurrency;e-commerce","Measurement;Cryptocurrency;Peer-to-peer computing;Computer science","application program interfaces;electronic commerce;human factors;Internet;security of data;user interfaces","eBay;Ethereum blockchain platform;Truffle development framework;Ethereum smart contract;Ethereum network;Rinkeby test network;average gas consumption;contract creation times;cost analysis;gas cost;online auction marketplace;online options;in-person options;decentralized marketplace application;user data;Web interface;auction marketplaces;centralized online marketplaces;API","","14","","24","","18 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

BCOOL relies on the heterogeneity of Machine Learning, Software-Defined Networks and Network Function Virtualization that is customized in three hybrid cloud/edge-based On/Offchain smart contract modules and ruled by an efficient and reliable communication protocol. BCOOL's first novel module aims at managing message and vehicle trustworthiness using a novel, dynamic and hybrid Blockchain Fog-based Distributed Trust Contract Strategy (FDTCS). The second novel module accurately and proactively predicts the occurrence of congestion, ahead of time, using a novel Hybrid On/Off-Chain Multiple Linear Regression Software-defined Contract Strategy (HOMLRCS). This module presents a virtualization facility layer to the third novel K-means/Random Forest-based On/Off-Chain Dynamic Service Function Chaining Contract Strategy (KRF-ODSFCS) that dynamically, securely and proactively predicts VNF placements and their chaining order in the context of SFCs w.r.t users' dynamic QoS priority demands. BCOOL exhibits a linear complexity and a strong resilience to failures. Simulation results show that BCOOL outperforms the next best comparable strategies by 80% and 100% reliability and efficiency gains in challenging data congestion environments. This yields to fast, reliable and accurate congestion prediction decisions, ahead of time, and optimizes transaction validation processing time.

How to implement offloading to alleviate computation burdens at MDs while guaranteeing high security in mobile edge cloud is a challenging problem. In this paper, we investigate simultaneously the security and computation offloading problems in a multi-user MECCO system with blockchain. First, to improve the offloading security, we propose a trustworthy access control using blockchain, which can protect cloud resources against illegal offloading behaviours. Then, to tackle the computation management of authorized MDs, we formulate a computation offloading problem by jointly optimizing the offloading decisions, the allocation of computing resource and radio bandwidth, and smart contract usage. This optimization problem aims to minimize the long-term system costs of latency, energy consumption and smart contract fee among all MDs.

Moreover, they will face new load structures due for example to the growth of the electric vehicle market. These trends raise the need for new paradigms for distribution grids operation, in which Distribution System Operators will increasingly rely on demand side flexibility and households will progressively become prosumers playing an active role on smart grid energy management. However, in present energy management architectures, the lack of coordination among actors limits the capability of the grid to enable the mentioned trends. In this paper we tackle this problem by proposing an architecture that enables households to autonomously exchange energy blocks and flexibility services with neighbors, operators and market actors. The solution is based on a blockchain transactive platform. We focus on a market application, where households can trade energy with their neighbors, aimed to locally balancing renewable energy production. We propose a market mechanism and dynamic transport prices that provide an incentive for households to locally manage energy resources in a way that responds to both prosumer and operator needs.

One solution to this issue is to coordinate charging scheduling. Various scheduling schemes have been proposed but discussion on the potential impact of the schemes to EV owners' comfort is very limited. This paper aims to provide insights on the degree of negative impact different EV scheduling schemes can create to EV owners' comfort (defined as being related to the EV state of charges). We demonstrate this by testing three heuristic scheduling schemes in a simulated grid operating under normal and faulty conditions. The results reflect the need for compensation mechanisms in electricity contracts where EV scheduling is imposed on EV owners.","2378-8542","978-1-5090-1238-1","10.1109/ISGT-Asia.2015.7387003","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7387003","electric vehicles;smart grids;demand side management;load management","Scheduling;Yttrium;Schedules;Electric vehicles;Contracts;Voltage control;Power grids","electric vehicles;scheduling","electric vehicle charging scheduling;electric vehicle owners comfort;EV;power grid operators;voltage instability;heuristic scheduling schemes;electricity contracts","","1","","28","","21 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Yet, current solutions focus on single-keyword search over encrypted data on the blockchain. To extend such approaches to multi-keyword scenarios, they essentially perform a single-keyword search for multiple times and take the intersection of the results. However, such extensions suffer from privacy and efficiency issues. In particular, the service peers, which process the search requests, will be aware of the intermediate results, which include the data associated with each of the encrypted keywords. Moreover, these multiple traversals incur long delays in performing the search requests one after another with an extra cost in calculating the intersection of multiple sets. Finally, the service peers will charge the data owner a lot for writing the vast intermediate results to the smart contract. In this paper, we propose a bloom filter-enabled multi-keyword search protocol with enhanced efficiency as well as privacy preservation. In the protocol, a low-frequency keyword selected by a bloom filter will be used to filter the database when performing a multi-keyword search operation. Because the keyword is of low frequency, the majority of the data will be excluded from the result, which reduces the computational cost significantly. Moreover, we propose to use pseudorandom tags to facilitate completing each search operation in only one round. In this way, no intermediate results are generated, and the privacy is preserved. Finally, we implement the protocol in a local simulated blockchain network and conduct extensive experiments. The results indicate that our multi-keyword search protocol outperforms the traditional method with an average of 14.67% less time delay and 59.96% less financial cost.","","978-1-7281-4693-5","10.1109/Blockchain.2019.00062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8946181","Blockchain;symmetric searchable encryption;smart contract","Cryptography;Smart contracts;Blockchain;Databases;Data centers;Reliability","cryptography;data privacy;data structures;distributed databases;query formulation;text analysis","bloom filter-enabled multikeyword search protocol;privacy preservation;keyword frequency;encrypted data;searchable blockchains;encrypted distributed storage systems;encrypted keywords;pseudorandom tags","","3","","20","","2 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such clients and devices rely on a view of the blockchain provided by full nodes acting as gateways. However, gateway nodes sometimes can provide a distorted view of the blockchain that makes lightweight clients vulnerable to the eclipse attack. When under such an attack, a client cannot differentiate between a forked view of the blockchain and the legitimate blockchain ledger leading to fatal consequences and huge losses incurred. In this paper, we propose a data attestation solution that employs full nodes as validators to attest the responses reported by gateways of lightweight nodes. We leverage smart contracts to give lightweight clients confidence in the data reported as they are unable to validate it from the blockchain network themselves. The system governs the attestation process that comprises submitting attestation requests, approving them, recording the response of validators, and manage payments. Clients can, thereafter, provide their feedback about the validator/gateway performance in the form of a reputation score.

In a typical crowdsourcing framework, independent workers compete to be allocated requesters' tasks. These workers advertise their costs to the centralized platform, which then decides the final allocation of tasks. While performing the allocation, centralized platforms face two main challenges: 1) how to ensure trusted execution for the allocation of tasks, and 2) how to motivate workers to declare their truthful costs. To address these challenges, ABCrowd proposes to run the crowdsourcing platform entirely on Ethereum Blockchain while incorporating auctions. Blockchain and smart contracts guarantee trusted execution for the allocation through autonomous and transparent on-Chain execution. ABCrowd uses the Repeated-Single-Minded Bidder (R-SMB) auction mechanism, which motivates workers to bid truthfully before allocating them and calculating their payments. R-SMB is an approximation of the optimized off-Chain Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism in terms of maximized profit. It entails repeating the Single-Minded Bidder (SMB) auction mechanism to meet the allocation requirement of crowdsourcing applications. ABCrowd is implemented and evaluated using Solidity on a private Ethereum Blockchain, where a real publicly available dataset is used. The proposed on-Chain R-SMB auction mechanism is compared to the off-Chain VCG mechanism, where the results show that R-SMB provides similar performance to VCG in terms of the average number of allocated tasks. Furthermore, R-SMB outperforms VCG in workers' travelled distance and requesters' costs, at a low execution cost.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2965897","Khalifa University of Science, Technology and Research(grant numbers:8474000012); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8955886","Crowdsourcing;blockchain;smart contracts;auction","Blockchain;Task analysis;Resource management;Smart contracts;Privacy;Crowdsensing","costing;crowdsourcing;cryptocurrencies;distributed databases;electronic commerce;incentive schemes;pricing;resource allocation","Ethereum Blockchain;ABCrowd;distributed auction-blockchain-based crowdsourcing framework;independent workers;off-Chain VCG mechanism;R-SMB auction mechanism;private Ethereum Blockchain;crowdsourcing applications;off-Chain Vickrey-Clarke-Groves;Repeated-Single-Minded Bidder auction mechanism;on-Chain execution;crowdsourcing platform;trusted execution;centralized platform;allocated requesters","","8","","31","CCBY","10 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Machine learning can be one important subroutine in such a decentralized ecosystem. Unfortunately, machine learning programs are usually computational intensive as well as randomized, which fall into the inherent limitations of open blockchain where complex and randomized programs cannot be executed by the underlying nodes collectively. Given also the limitations of existing verifiable computing techniques, we propose a crowdsourcing idea from the game theoretic perspective to resolve the tension. We design a simple incentive mechanism so that the execution of a wide range of complex programs can be crowdsourced via the blockchain, and any false computing result could be deterred. In particular, our protocol works in the scenarios that there is no trusted third-party involved; Moreover, our protocol not only works in the classical model of non-colluding service providers, but also can tolerate any potential coalition up to n-1, where n is the total number of service providers. We also showcase how to use our protocol to crowdsource two typical kinds of machine learning tasks via open blockchain. We envision that our solution is not only promising to launch decentralized applications involving a wide range of machine learning programs, but also a stepping stone towards a general way to empowering intensive and randomized computations atop the open blockchain.","2375-9259","978-1-5386-9288-2","10.1109/ICDMW.2018.00019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8637413","smart contract;blockchain;machine learning;crowdsourcing;game theory","Smart contracts;Blockchain;Machine learning;Task analysis;Games;Cryptography","crowdsourcing;cryptography;distributed databases;game theory;learning (artificial intelligence)","public blockchains;machine learning programs;game theoretic perspective;decentralized applications;randomized computations;verifiable computing;incentive mechanism;crowdsourcing;public ledger;distributed ledger","","5","","20","","10 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We study how this service can be provided by a unit with a non-ideal storage. We consider two broad classes of storage technologies characterized by different state of charge evolution equations, namely batteries and flywheels. We first focus on a single contract, and obtain formulas for the upward and downward regulation parameters that a unit with either a battery or a flywheel should declare to the operator to maximize its reward. We then focus on a multiple contract setting and show how to analytically quantify the reward that such a unit could obtain in successive contracts. We quantify this reward using bounds and expectation, and compare our analytical results with those obtained from a dataset of real-world regulation signals.

However, the behavior of the system is decided based on the real-world data, so the system may cause critical issues if the data is tampered by attackers. Therefore, in order to guarantee reliability of the real-world data, a data management platform utilizing blockchain technology has been studied by many researchers. The blockchain can guarantee integrity of the stored data for the IoT system, but cannot guarantee authenticity of the data because tampering of the data that has not been stored on the database yet cannot be prevented.Therefore, in this study, we propose a new data management platform using blockchain that contributes to provide reliable IoT services by guaranteeing both integrity and authenticity of the real-world data. The data for the IoT service is continuously generated on the real field, and there may exist not only a terminal (e.g., smartphone, sensor node) which is an origin of the data but also the other terminals on the field. In the proposed platform, the origin attempts to guarantee authenticity of the data by requesting the near terminals to generate the same types of data. By comparing the data and the update history of the data among the terminals, the proposed platform attempts to verify authenticity of the data because the tendency of the update history of the origin should be almost the same as that of the cooperators if the data tampering did not occur.In order to evaluate effectiveness of the proposed platform, we design and prototype a data management platform for a physical distribution system.

We define timeout for the energy micro-transactions, and leverage a set of Access Points (APs) to cooperatively confirm the timeout energy micro-transaction by utilizing consortium blockchain, to form a ground main chain. Furthermore, a contract theory based resource cooperation scheme is designed to motivate the UAVs to participate in wireless power transfer, and to incentivize the APs to contribute their resources in cooperatively verifying the timeout energy micro-transactions.

During the current COVID-19 pandemic, there have been many efforts to predict the infection cases, number of fatalities, and other medical indicators, using a range of statistical or epidemiological models. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, there have been many efforts to forecast the infection cases, deaths and other medical indicators including hospital capacity calculation, with a variety of predictive epidemiological models. These forecasting projects have influenced policies in some countries. However, the prediction of the COVID-19 pandemic as a “wicked problem” is uncertain by nature. The uncertainty is deep-rooted in the many unknown unknowns about the communicable virus itself and the complexity, heterogeneity and dynamism of human behaviors, government interventions and testing protocols. As there are no set standards between and sometimes within the countries, it makes it a `wicked problem', nearly impossible to predict. The wicked and uncertain nature of this pandemic makes the aim for prediction accuracy deceptive. Herein, we propose to be cautious about the intent for “accurate” predictions or models. Instead of making inaccurate predictions let us try to understand the data that is available to us to explore the significant indicators of the uncertainty. Such indicators are expected to make the planning and policy more “future-informed” and possibly introduce and guide pre-cautionary actions now to shape the real future. Also, we have proposed here a Power Apps-based app for organizational users to do a check in on their known location(s) to facilitate contact tracing if needed in an event of Novel Coronavirus suspected case as the countries move between different lockdown levels.","","978-1-7281-8488-3","10.1109/CoNTESA50436.2020.9302854","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9302854","Decision Making;Contact Tracing;Smart Government;Smart Application;Decision Support System","COVID-19;Viruses (medical);Pandemics;Diseases;Predictive models;Government;Testing","decision making;diseases;epidemics;hospitals;medical information systems;microorganisms;mobile computing;organisational aspects;statistical analysis","data driven decision making;contract tracing app;COVID-19 pandemic;statistical models;medical indicators;predictive epidemiological models;wicked problem;hospital capacity calculation;organizations;New Zealand;novel coronavirus virus","","","","12","","28 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a secure and efficient V2G energy trading framework by exploring blockchain, contract theory, and edge computing. First, we develop a consortium blockchain-based secure energy trading mechanism for V2G.

A critical challenge for data sharing is to incentivize users to participate in collecting and sharing data. The traditional incentive mechanism of crowdsourcing is not practical for IoV because of its trust issues. Although blockchain technology has been introduced to address trust issues and security challenges, ensuring trust in off-chain data for the blockchain-based approaches is still an open issue. In this article, we propose a quality-driven auction-based incentive mechanism based on a consortium blockchain that guarantees trust in both on-chain data and off-chain data. We first introduce a consortium blockchain that is used as an open and distributed hyperledger to address the security issue of on-chain data. Then, we formulate the problem as a reverse auction in which the platform acts as an auctioneer that purchases data from users. By utilizing a data quality-driven auction model, the evaluated data quality via expectation maximization is used to ensure the trust in off-chain data. The quality-driven, auction-based incentive mechanism can obtain the high-quality data and optimal social welfare with low social cost. Otherwise, we design a smart contract to perform the data sharing automatically. Finally, the extensive simulations show that our proposed algorithm achieves maximum social welfare, outperforms other solutions, and scales well when the number of users or tasks increase. Moreover, the performance of the smart contract shows its low computing cost.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2946611","National Key Research and Development Plan(grant numbers:2018YFB1003803); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61802450,61722214); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018A030313005); Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Entrepreneurial Teams(grant numbers:2017ZT07X355); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8863960","Blockchain;data sharing;incentive mechanism;Internet of Vehicles (IoV)","Blockchain;Data integrity;Servers;Cloud computing;Internet of Things;Task analysis","cryptocurrencies;electronic commerce;expectation-maximisation algorithm;incentive schemes;indoor communication;Internet of Things;mobile radio;smart cities","off-chain data;high-quality data;data sharing;quality-driven incentive mechanism;off-chain guarantees;Internet of Vehicles applications;smart cities;smart transportation;blockchain-based approaches;quality-driven auction-based incentive mechanism;consortium blockchain;data quality-driven auction model;evaluated data quality;distributed hyperledger;on-chain data security;expectation maximization;optimal social welfare;smart contract","","9","","40","IEEE","11 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Meanwhile, we ensure the service correctness of data aggregation and sanitization by delicately employing hardware-assisted transparent enclave. Furthermore, we maintain the robustness of our system against faulty data providers that submit invalid data, with a customized zero-knowledge range proof scheme.

Miners provide computing resources and services in exchange for incentives such as static block rewards and transaction fees collected from blockchain users. However, our findings suggest that the current reward scheme may not encourage miners to process user transactions. A non-cooperative strategy that submits a block with no transaction can be more rewarded than a cooperative strategy. As a consequence, the non-cooperative strategy can prevail over the cooperative strategy, decrease the system throughput, and distort credit distribution. We particularly choose Ethereum project as a subject since it is a general-purpose smart contract platform. By investigating the past two years of its ledger history, we find network propagation and block processing delays are the most significant factors that cause miners to choose the non-cooperative strategy. From this finding, we develop a more accurate statistical model for a block discovery time, as well as a reward matrix. We then derive the condition that either strategy has no additional gain, which also helps to estimate whether the transaction fee is underpriced or not. Simulation results show that the non-cooperative strategy is no longer dominant under the revised reward scheme.","2161-4407","978-1-5090-6014-6","10.1109/IJCNN.2018.8489267","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8489267","","Bitcoin;Peer-to-peer computing;Contracts;Random variables;Data mining;Exponential distribution","contracts;data mining;matrix algebra;statistical analysis","block processing delays;block discovery time;reward matrix;transaction fee;revised reward scheme;proof-of-work blockchain;incentive-driven design;static block rewards;blockchain users;current reward scheme;user transactions;general-purpose smart contract platform;network propagation","","2","","28","","14 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Now, more than ten years later, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), a peer-to-peer financial paradigm which leverages blockchain-based smart contracts to ensure its integrity and security, contains over 702m USD of capital as of April 15th, 2020. As this ecosystem develops, it is at risk of the very sort of financial meltdown it is supposed to be preventing. In this paper we explore how design weaknesses and price fluctuations in DeFi protocols could lead to a DeFi crisis. We focus on DeFi lending protocols as they currently constitute most of the DeFi ecosystem with a 76% market share by capital as of April 15th, 2020. First, we demonstrate the feasibility of attacking Maker's governance design to take full control of the protocol, the largest DeFi protocol by market share, which would have allowed the theft of 0.5bn USD of collateral and the minting of an unlimited supply of DAI tokens. In doing so, we present a novel strategy utilizing so-called flash loans that would have in principle allowed the execution of the governance attack in just two transactions and without the need to lock any assets. Approximately two weeks after we disclosed the attack details, Maker modified the governance parameters mitigating the attack vectors. Second, we turn to a central component of financial risk in DeFi lending protocols. Inspired by stress-testing as performed by central banks, we develop a stress-testing framework for a stylized DeFi lending protocol, focusing our attention on the impact of a drying-up of liquidity on protocol solvency. Based on our parameters, we find that with sufficiently illiquidity a lending protocol with a total debt of 400m USD could become undercollateralized within 19 days.","","978-1-7281-9390-8","10.1109/CVCBT50464.2020.00005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9150192","Cryptocurrencies;decentralized finance;stress-testing;financial crisis;governance attack;financial risk","Protocols;Contracts;Economics;Cryptography;Finance","contracts;cryptocurrencies;distributed databases;financial data processing;government policies;peer-to-peer computing;program testing;risk analysis;transaction processing","decentralized financial crisis;global financial crisis;financial risk;peer-to-peer financial paradigm;blockchain-based smart contracts;governance attack;DeFi lending protocol;Bitcoin;flash loans;stress testing framework;price fluctuations","","1","","51","","28 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, UBI requires sensitive driving data to determine insurance premiums, and this could result in serious privacy breach for drivers. Meanwhile, existing UBI solutions rely on a centralized entity (i.e., the insurance company) to manage insurances. In this article, we design a decentralized and privacy-preserving UBI scheme, called DUBI, based on the blockchain technology and zero-knowledge proof. In our scheme, a smart contract running over the blockchain serves as a “decentralized” insurance company, while drivers continuously upload their committed driving data to the blockchain. Periodically, the driver submits accumulated driving statistics with a zero-knowledge proof to the smart contract, which verifies the proof and calculates the insurance premium from the submitted statistics. We formulate an ideal functionality for DUBI under the universal composability framework, and then provide a formal security proof for DUBI. Furthermore, we give in-depth analysis and performance evaluation for DUBI with an implementation based on Ethereum. It shows that DUBI is highly efficient in processing UBI insurances in both storage and computation: DUBI is about seven times more efficient than existing schemes in storage, and proof generation and verification take only 7 and 30 ms, respectively.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.3028014","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972229,61832012); Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:ZR2019MF007); Fundamental Research Funds of Shandong University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9210591","Blockchain;insurance;pay-as-you-drive;privacy","Insurance;Vehicles;Contracts;Companies;Privacy","blockchains;contracts;cryptographic protocols;data privacy;insurance","blockchain technology;zero-knowledge proof;smart contract;decentralized insurance company;committed driving data;formal security proof;UBI insurances;scalable decentralized privacy-preserving usage;traditional insurance schemes;usage-based insurance;insurance premium calculation;serious privacy breach;decentralized privacy-preserving UBI scheme;DUBI;time 7.0 ms;time 30.0 ms","","","","23","IEEE","1 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, time series consumption data for every consumer is split into N time windows. For a particular time window, a duration curve is calculated providing significant shape-based information disregarding temporal aspects. Each duration curve is sampled according to statistical characteristics and its relevant shape is captured. Therefore, every individual is represented by the evolution of N simplified duration curves. A cluster analysis, based on the K-means algorithm and the Euclidean distance, provides the different consumer profiles in a given time window. CONDUCT's current implementation runs on Apache Spark, a state-of-the-art distributed computing framework. As a case study, CONDUCTS has been experimentally assessed on the real hourly metered data collected in the time frame of one year for a large number of Spanish residential consumers.

We propose a notion of stability for the payment processing network consisting of such two-sided queues using the notion of on-chain rebalancing.

Thus, an increasing number of firms have been contracting out parts of their R&D. In Japan for example, industrial R&D outsourcing expenditures have more than doubled between 1986 and 1998. Similar trends were observed in Germany and the USA. Yet the changes, at least to the extent of R&D outsourcing, have not been uniform across industries. Different surveys show a tendency to bipolarization. While in some industries R&D outsourcing has become widely accepted among established companies, other industries have only begun to think about this issue. Based on five international case studies this paper aims to contribute to a rather scarce pool of research into this topic by providing some insights how the outsourcing of R&D has been implemented in practice, and by exposing some of its chances and risks through the analysis of critical success factors.

An indispensable service of crowdsourcing systems is task recommendation, which means tasks should be accurately recommended to the workers with aligned interests. However, existing systems rely on their separate servers to conduct recommendation services, resulting in computing resources locked inside each isolated system. Moreover, due to the wide attacking surfaces of traditional centralized servers setting, existing systems are subject to single points of failure or malicious data breaches. Therefore, failure to address these inherent limitations properly will hinder the wide adoption of crowdsourcing. In this paper, we propose and implement FedCrowd, the first federated and privacy-preserving crowdsourcing platform by using blockchain technology. Our main idea is to employ the smart contract as a trusted platform for systems to release encrypted tasks, and carefully craft matching protocols to enable efficient task recommendations in the ciphertext domain. Our task-matching protocols are highly customized for the decentralized settings, where users can securely perform keyword and range-based queries over federated task indexes without sharing secret keys.

In the framework, we first develop a collaborative edge computing mechanism, where each 6G infrastructure (e.g., satellite, drone, and base station) cooperates with parked vehicles to provide services for MVs in order to improve the efficiency of the edge computing services. Then, considering the security issues, a smart-contract-based secure collaboration mechanism is designed to establish a reliable transaction environment for edge computing in 6G. Next, based on the personalized service requirements of MVs and the available resources in 6G SAGIVNs, the resource allocation strategy of each infrastructure and the competitiveness of different infrastructures are discussed to provide MVs with the optimal personalized service. After that, compared with the conventional schemes, a case is studied to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Fair payment, a candidate solution, can potentially facilitate fair trading among outsourcing computation participants such as users and workers. However, most existing solutions including traditional e-cash-based or blockchain-based, may potentially compromise the worker's fairness (i.e., does not achieve robust fairness, since trusted third parties are required during the trading process), or involve heavy zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs, with significant computation costs). To mitigate these limitations, we propose a system model of an optimized blockchain-based fair payment (OBFP) for outsourcing computations. Then, we construct a ZKP-free solution based on blockchain by combining any secure commitment, accumulator, and symmetric encryption schemes, as well as a hash function. To demonstrate the utility of our proposed OBFP system, we provide security analysis, performance evaluation and a comparison with existing popular solutions. Specifically, the cryptographic tools are instantiated as commitment (Perdesen commitment), accumulator (RSA-based accumulator), and symmetric encryption (a concrete scheme with the indistinguishability under chosen-plaintext attack (IND-CPA) security), and a hash function (Keccak-256). The prototype is implemented in COSBench and Remix to analyze cloud scalability and concurrency, as well as gas cost.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2021.3073818","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019QY0800); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972294,61932016,62032005,61872089,61972094); Science Foundation of Fujian Provincial Science and Technology Agency(grant numbers:2020J02016); Special Project on Science and Technology Program of Hubei Province(grant numbers:2020AEA013); Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province(grant numbers:2020CFA052); Wuhan Municipal Science and Technology Project(grant numbers:2020010601012187); Cloud Technology Endowed Professorship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9406033","Blockchain;outsourcing computations;fair payment;smart contract;robust fairness","Outsourcing;Proposals;Blockchain;Task analysis;Hash functions;Smart contracts;Encryption","blockchains;cloud computing;cryptographic protocols;data privacy;outsourcing;public key cryptography","RSA-based accumulator;ZKP-free solution;significant computation costs;trusted third parties;robust fairness;worker;traditional e-cash-based;outsourcing computation participants;fair trading;candidate solution;zero-trust;growing computing demands;cloud computing;outsourcing computations;optimized blockchain-based fair payment;OBFP","","1","","35","IEEE","16 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

AVs are a complex system composed of many subsystems, making them a typical target for attackers. Therefore, the firmware of the different subsystems needs to be updated to the latest version by the manufacturer to fix bugs and introduce new features, e.g., using security patches. In this paper, we propose a distributed firmware update scheme for the AVs' subsystems, leveraging blockchain and smart contract technology. A consortium blockchain made of different AVs manufacturers is used to ensure the authenticity and integrity of firmware updates. Instead of depending on centralized third parties to distribute the new updates, we enable AVs, namely distributors, to participate in the distribution process and we take advantage of their mobility to guarantee high availability and fast delivery of the updates. To incentivize AVs to distribute the updates, a reward system is established that maintains a credit reputation for each distributor account in the blockchain. A zero-knowledge proof protocol is used to exchange the update in return for a proof of distribution in a trustless environment. Moreover, we use attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme to ensure that only authorized AVs will be able to download and use a new update. Our analysis indicates that the additional cryptography primitives and exchanged transactions do not affect the operation of the AVs network. Also, our security analysis demonstrates that our scheme is efficient and secure against different attacks.","1558-2612","978-1-5386-7646-2","10.1109/WCNC.2019.8885769","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8885769","Firmware update;Blockchain;Smart contracts;Autonomous Vehicles;Attribute based encryption (ABE);Zero-knowledge proof","Blockchain;Smart contracts;Encryption;Autonomous vehicles","authorisation;cryptography;distributed databases;distributed processing;firmware;remotely operated vehicles","firmware updates;distribution process;authorized AVs;AVs network;blockchain-based firmware update scheme;autonomous vehicles;distributed firmware update scheme;consortium blockchain;AV manufacturers;AVs subsystems","","18","","16","","31 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Data deduplication is one of the important technologies to reduce the storage cost of cloud storage system. In a cloud storage system with deduplication technology, the client can outsource the data files to the cloud storage server and pay for them. Fair payment is one of key issues in the cloud deduplication storage system. At present, a variety of secure deduplication encryption schemes have been designed to protect the privacy of client data. However, most existing fair payment solutions use traditional electronic cash systems to generate payment tokens, which requires a trusted authority to prevent double-spending. Trusted authorities will become bottlenecks in the payment system. Faced with this problem, in this paper, we propose a new decentralized fair payment protocol for cloud deduplication storage system by utilizing ethereum blockchain technology. The new protocol takes advantage of the decentralization of blockchain technology, allowing direct transactions without the participation of trusted third parties. In the new protocol, if a malicious situation occurs, the system can guarantee fair payment by pre-storing penalty money in the smart contract.

Blockchain technology has emerged as a promising solution that can provide a secure and transparent distributed ledger, while autonomously executing transactions upon fulfillment of pre-defined criteria (“smart contracts”). As a result, credits can be easily tracked from generation through ownership trades to ultimate redemption. This leaves a simple audit trail, significantly reducing the associated time and cost, and enables producers to monetize their credits immediately after generation. Clean Energy Blockchain Network (CEBN) has recently announced a partnership with the Silicon valley power, where we will apply blockchain technology to simplify their participation in the low carbon fuel standard (LCFS) program.

The day-ahead time-differentiated price tariffs are considered as the base energy cost to be sent to the consumers by the energy supplier with whom they have a contract. The aggregator, as a third-party agent responsible for the aggregation of demand-side flexibility, defines an hourly reward to motivate consumers to participate in the provision of flexibility by reshaping their consumption. A mixed integer linear programming model is developed including the physically based behavior of demand-side resources consisting of shiftable loads, interruptible loads, thermostatically controlled loads, local generation, battery storage systems and electric vehicles. Each consumer is equipped with a home energy management system that performs the management of end-use loads according to consumer's preferences and restrictions, energy prices and any rewards that may exist. In this study, the potential of consumers to provide flexibility and their response to different reward signals are investigated considering different characteristics of the available energy resources, including load profiles and comfort preferences. Different reward values are defined to assess their impact on the amount of flexibility at the consumer and aggregator levels. Numerical results show the potential of different types of consumers to participate in demand response programs differ as their responsiveness to the rewards is not identical.","","978-1-7281-4701-7","10.1109/SEST48500.2020.9203476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9203476","aggregation;demand response;characterization of demand-side flexibility;mixed integer linear programming","Load modeling;Real-time systems;Optimization;Planning;Batteries;Power demand;Mixed integer linear programming","battery storage plants;building management systems;contracts;demand side management;electric vehicles;integer programming;load regulation;numerical analysis;power system economics;pricing;tariffs;thermostats","day-ahead time-differentiated price tariffs;base energy cost;demand-side resources;home energy management system;energy prices;demand response programs;demand-side flexibility;contracts;third-party agent;mixed integer linear programming model;shiftable loads;interruptible loads;thermostatically controlled loads;local generation;battery storage systems;electric vehicles;energy resource;numerical analysis","","","","18","","22 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the scheme, a smart-contract-based secure edge computing architecture is designed by jointly considering the attack models and the characteristics of the 6G network infrastructures (e.g., satellites, drones, base stations and roadside units), where each network infrastructure manages a number of parking vehicles (PVs) to complete computing services collaboratively. With this architecture, based on the available computing resources owned by different network infrastructures, the collaborative computing resource allocation (CCRA) algorithm is designed to help each network infrastructure decide a customized service strategy (CSS) to satisfy the QoE of MVs. After deciding the CSSs, a model based on the second price sealed auction is formulated to describe the competition among the network infrastructures, where the Nash equilibrium of the game is obtained to guide their optimal bidding strategies (OBSs) to obtain the chance for completing the services.

We provide an extensive analysis of the Verifier's Dilemma, using a data-driven model-based approach that combines closed-form expressions, machine learning techniques and discrete-event simulation. We collect data from over 300,000 smart contracts and experimentally obtain their CPU execution times. Gaussian Mixture Models and Random Forest Regression transform the data into distributions and inputs suitable for the simulator. We show that, indeed, it is often economically rational not to verify, in particular for miners with less hashing power. We consider two approaches to mitigate the implications of the Verifier's Dilemma, namely parallelization and active insertion of invalid blocks, both will be shown to be effective.","1530-0889","978-1-7281-5809-9","10.1109/DSN48063.2020.00038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9153385","Ethereum;Smart Contract;Benchmark;Performance;Simulation;Verifier's Dilemma","Contracts;Closed-form solutions;Analytical models;Forestry;Cryptocurrency;Data collection","","","","","","28","","31 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Also, by informing the blacklisted Internet Protocol(IP), each IPS can share attack source information so that attack traffic blocking can be carried out on IPS that are closer to the source of the attack. Therefore, the attack traffic passing through the network can be drastically reduced because the attack traffic has been blocked on the IPS that is closer to the attack source. The blocking of existing DDoS attack traffic is generally carried out on each IPS without a mechanism to share information on the source of the attack so that each IPS cannot cooperate. Also, even though the DDoS attack traffic did not reach the server because it had been blocked by IPS, the attack traffic still flooded the network so that network performance was reduced. Through smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, it is possible to inform the source of the attack or blacklisted IP addresses without requiring additional infrastructure. The blacklisted IP address is used by IPS to detect and handle DDoS attacks. Through the blacklisted IP distribution scheme, testing and analysis are carried out to see information on the source of the attack on each IPS and the attack traffic that passes on the network. The result is that each IPS can have the same blacklisted IP so that each IPS can have the same attack source information. The results also showed that the attack traffic through the network infrastructure can be drastically reduced. Initially, the total number of attack packets had an average of 115,578 reduced to 27,165.","","978-1-7281-7726-7","10.1109/ITIS50118.2020.9320996","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9320996","DDoS;IPS;Blockchain;Blacklisted IP;Smart Contract","IP networks;Blockchain;Denial-of-service attack;Testing;Servers;Computer crime;Smart contracts","blockchains;computer network security;Internet;IP networks;telecommunication traffic","DDoS attacks;IPS snort;DDoS attack mitigation;attack source information;attack traffic blocking;blacklisted IP address;blacklisted IP distribution system;blockchain;intrusion prevention system;Internet Protocol","","","","21","","21 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The in-network cache, one of the important characteristics, makes data packets to be available from multiple locations on the Internet. Hence data access control and their enforcement mechanisms become even more critical in the NDNs. In this paper, we propose a novel encryption-based data access control scheme using Role-Based Encryption (RBE). The inheritance property of our scheme provides a natural way to achieve efficient data access control over hierarchical content. This in turn makes our scheme suitable for large scale real world content-centric applications and services such as Netflix. Further, the proposed scheme introduces an anonymous signature-based authentication mechanism to reject bogus data requests nearer to the source, thereby preventing them from entering the network. This in turn helps to mitigate better denial of service attacks. In addition, the signature mechanism supports unlinkability, which is essential to prevent leakages of individual user's access patterns. Another major feature of the proposed scheme is that it provides accountability of the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) using batch signature verification. Moreover, we have developed a transparent and secure dispute resolution and payment mechanism using smart-contract and blockchain technologies. We present a formal security analysis of our scheme to show it is provably secure against Chosen Plaintext Attacks. We also demonstrate that our scheme supports more functionalities than the existing schemes and its performance is better in terms of computation, communication and storage.","2575-8462","978-1-6654-3819-3","10.1109/SRDS53918.2021.00025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9603629","Named Data Networking;Access Control;Accountability;Data Encryption;Blockchain;Smart Contract","Access control;Handwriting recognition;Web and internet services;Smart contracts;Authentication;Network architecture;Internet","","","","","","24","","22 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Accordingly, delivering regular software updates is critical to secure IoT devices. Manufactures face two predominant challenges in providing software updates to IoT devices: 1) scalability of the current client-server model and 2) integrity of the distributed updates - exacerbated due to the devices' computing power and lightweight cryptographic primitives. Motivated by these limitations, we propose CrowdPatching, a blockchain-based decentralized protocol, allowing manufacturers to delegate the delivery of software updates to self-interested distributors in exchange for cryptocurrency. Manufacturers announce updates by deploying a smart contract (SC), which in turn will issue cryptocurrency payments to any distributor who provides an unforgeable proof-of-delivery. The latter is provided by IoT devices authorizing the SC to issue payment to a distributor when the required conditions are met. These conditions include the requirement for a distributor to generate a zero-knowledge proof, generated with a novel proving system called zk-SNARKs. Compared with related work, CrowdPatching protocol offers three main advantages. First, the number of distributors can scale indefinitely by enabling the addition of new distributors at any time after the initial distribution by manufacturers (i.e., redistribution among the distributor network). The latter is not possible in existing protocols and is not account for. Secondly, we leverage the recent common integration of gateway or Hub in IoT deployments in our protocol to make CrowdPatching feasible even for the more constraint IoT devices. Thirdly, the trustworthiness of distributors is considered in our protocol, rewarding the honest distributors' engagements. We provide both informal and formal security analysis of CrowdPatching using Tamarin Prover.","2643-7929","978-1-7281-8326-8","10.1109/NCA51143.2020.9306689","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9306689","Internet of Things (IoT);Secure Update Delivery;Blockchain;Smart Contracts;zk-SNARKs;Tamarin Prover","Protocols;Software;Cryptography;Proposals;Smart contracts;Scalability;Public key","client-server systems;computer network security;cryptographic protocols;Internet;Internet of Things;theorem proving","IoT deployments;constraint IoT devices;honest distributors;towards decentralized IoT updates delivery leveraging blockchain;zero-knowledge proof;regular software updates;manufactures;current client-server model;distributed updates;blockchain-based decentralized protocol;self-interested distributors;proof-of-delivery;CrowdPatching protocol;distributor network","","","","21","","5 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

If design defects persist in a cloud user identity authentication scheme, direct risks of sensitive data loss and severe information breach will be incurred. At present, the main problem of cloud user identity management system is that it relies too much on third-party services. Although some third-party-detachment schemes have been proposed in recent years, most of them still rely heavily on cloud server-centered design system. In this paper, a cloud user identity management protocol based on ethereum blockchain was proposed, followed by an establishment of a simple credit management system framework. The new protocol is an improved version of CIDM (Consolidated Identity Management) referred to as EIDM (Ethrerum-based Identity Management) protocol. In the improved protocol, JWT (JSON Web Token) in OAuth 2.0 was used to introduce smart contracts into EIDM protocol, and the credit management system was added to the system so that it can provide a credible identity authentication protocol for cloud users and service providers. The new protocol solves the problem of over-reliance on third parties in the existing identity management system solutions. In the end, an analysis on the security of the new protocol showed that the EIDM protocol proposed in this paper presents more diversified security guarantees relative to the CIDM protocol. The performance evaluation results also indicated that the new protocol demonstrates better practicability and flexibility.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2933989","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61572019); Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi(grant numbers:2019GY-028); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8792212","Cloud computing;identity management;blockchain;reputation;smart contract","Cloud computing;Identity management systems;Blockchain;Smart contracts;Authentication","authorisation;cloud computing;cryptographic protocols;data privacy;message authentication;mobile computing","Ethereum-based cloud user identity management protocol;cloud system;cloud user identity authentication scheme;cloud user identity management system;third-party-detachment schemes;cloud server-centered design system;simple credit management system framework;EIDM protocol;credible identity authentication protocol;cloud users;service providers;CIDM protocol;identity management system solutions;ethrerum-based identity management;consolidated identity management","","2","","26","CCBY","8 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose an educational resources-oriented fair recommendation system based on consortium blockchain to solve the above problems. Firstly, we unite schools, educational institutions and other organizations to build an education consortium blockchain. Then, experts and teachers extensively participate in the education consortium blockchain to make recommendations through the automatic execution of smart contracts. Besides, the data of the recommendation process is written into the blockchain ledger through the consensus mechanism, which allows participants to verify safely and reliably.

Additionally, the demands of rapid response in industrial IoT scenarios (e.g., edge computing scenarios) is hardly realized under a public blockchain. In this brief, we propose an IoT-applicable access control model under an original double-layer blockchain architecture, in which the mortgage/registration and control processes can be disaggregated. Depending on this architecture, the communication overhead for IoT devices is reduced and a rapid response is achieved. With linear secret sharing scheme, attribute-based access policies for resource objects are established to ensure fine-grained access control.

The reliability of data is an important guarantee of the autonomous management of IIoT. Tracing abnormal senders is a challenge when hiding their real identity. Therefore, we design the first permissioned blockchain-based anonymous and traceable aggregate signature (PBATAS) scheme for IIoT. Smart contracts are used to authenticate anonymous sources and share cryptographic materials among entities, providing reliable regulatory support for IIoT. The regulator can quickly trace the abnormal data sources recorded on the blockchain, which is practical for the anonymous IIoT environment.

However, centralized evidence collection and preservation minimizes the reliability of digital evidence. To resolve this severe problem, this paper proposes a novel digital forensic architecture using fast-growing Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Blockchain technology for Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud. In this proposed forensic architecture, the evidence is collected and preserved in the blockchain that is distributed among multiple peers. To protect the system from unauthorized users, Secure Ring Verification based Authentication (SRVA) scheme is proposed. To strengthen the cloud environment, secret keys are generated optimally by using Harmony Search Optimization (HSO) algorithm. All data are encrypted based on the sensitivity level and stored in the cloud server. For encryption, Sensitivity Aware Deep Elliptic Curve Cryptography (SA-DECC) algorithm is presented. For every data stored in the cloud, a block is created in the SDN controller and the history of data is recorded as metadata. In each block, the Merkle hash tree is built by using Secure Hashing Algorithm-3 (SHA-3). Our system allows users to trace their data by deploying Fuzzy based Smart Contracts (FCS). Finally, evidence analysis is enabled by constructing Logical Graph of Evidence (LGoE) collected from the blockchain. Experiments are conducted in an integrated environment of java (for cloud and blockchain) and network simulator-3.26 (for SDN). The extensive analysis shows that proposed forensic architecture shows promising results in Response time, Evidence insertion time, Evidence verification time, Communication overhead, Hash computation time, Key generation time, Encryption time, Decryption time and total change rate.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2946978","MehranNet ISP (Internet Service Provider), Langarud, Guilan, Iran; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8865056","Software-defined networking;blockchain;evidence collection;cloud forensics;security","Blockchain;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Digital forensics;Security;Smart contracts","cloud computing;computer crime;digital forensics;Java;public key cryptography;software defined networking","evidence verification time;evidence insertion time;fuzzy based smart contracts;secure hashing algorithm-3;sensitivity aware deep elliptic curve cryptography algorithm;secure ring verification;digital forensic architecture;hash computation time;IaaS cloud environment;digital forensics architecture;encryption time;key generation time;forensic architecture;integrated environment;evidence analysis;SDN controller;cloud server;sensitivity level;harmony search optimization algorithm;secret keys;authentication scheme;unauthorized users;multiple peers;infrastructure-as-a-service cloud;Blockchain technology;software-defined networking;digital evidence;centralized evidence collection;cyber-crimes;intelligent evolution;cloud forensics","","2","","48","CCBY","14 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

DApp fingerprinting can identify users' visits to specific DApps by analyzing the resulting network traffic, revealing much sensitive information about the users, such as their real identities, financial conditions and religious or political preferences. DApps deployed on the same platform usually adopt the same communication interface and similar traffic encryption settings, making the resulting traffic less discriminative. Existing encrypted traffic classification methods either require hand-crafted and fine-tuning features or suffer from low accuracy. It remains a challenging task to conduct DApp fingerprinting in an accurate and efficient way. In this paper, we present GraphDApp, a novel DApp fingerprinting method using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We propose a graph structure named Traffic Interaction Graph (TIG) as an information-rich representation of encrypted DApp flows, which implicitly reserves multiple dimensional features in bidirectional client-server interactions. Using TIG, we turn DApp fingerprinting into a graph classification problem and design a powerful GNN-based classifier. We collect real-world traffic datasets from 1,300 DApps with more than 169,000 flows. The experimental results show that GraphDApp is superior to the other state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy in both closed- and open-world scenarios.

Thus, detecting information leakage on Android is in urgent need. However, till now, there is still no complete vetting process applied to Android markets. State-of-the-art approaches for detecting Android information leakage apply dynamic analysis on user site, thus they introduce large runtime overhead to the Android apps. This paper proposes a new approach called Leak Miner, which detects leakage of sensitive information on Android with static taint analysis. Unlike dynamic approaches, Leak Miner analyzes Android apps on market site. Thus, it does not introduce runtime overhead to normal execution of target apps. Besides, Leak Miner can detect information leakage before apps are distributed to users, so malicious apps can be removed from market before users download them. Our evaluation result shows that Leak Miner can detect 145 true information leakages inside a 1750 app set.","","978-1-4673-4546-0","10.1109/WCSE.2012.26","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6394931","Information security;Mobile computing","Smart phones;Androids;Humanoid robots;Java;Context;Security;Runtime","data mining;operating systems (computers);program diagnostics;security of data","LeakMiner;information leakage detection;Android platform;static taint analysis;Android application market;dynamic analysis;Android apps;malicious apps","","82","1","10","","10 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Frequent incidences of fraudulent practices expose lack of transparency in agri-food supply chains, causing concerns related to economic losses, eroding consumer trust and enterprise brand value. Traditionally associated with cryptocurrencies, banking and finance, blockchains are now being applied in the agri-food sector to address supply chain-related challenges. This article examines the question: How blockchain technology facilitates transparency in agri-food supply chains? Primary attributes of blockchain, namely traceability, immutability, auditability, and provenance, promote transparency in supply chains. Using thematic analysis, the following three areas were identified for implementing blockchain in agri-food supply chains: first, agri-food distribution; second, agri-food origin and sourcing; third, agri-food safety and quality. By cross-mapping thematic areas with primary attributes, our analysis resulted in classification of 25 uses cases. Preliminary findings of this study highlight blockchain-enabled transparency via contemporary uses cases in conceptual, proof-of-concept and commercial stages. It is imperative to sift through the hype and scrutinize limitations of the technology which could interfere with its adoption, deployment, and scalability in agri-food supply chains.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2021.3110903","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9578927","Agri-food;blockchain;digital technologies;industry 4.0;provenance;supply chain (SC);thematic analysis;traceability;transparency;use cases.","Blockchains;Supply chains;Smart contracts;Codes;Peer-to-peer computing;Distributed ledger;Costs","","","","","","","IEEE","18 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

As of today, a swarm of robots is not able to communicate and perform tasks in transparent and autonomous ways. Many believe blockchain is the imminent future of distributed autonomous systems. A blockchain is a system of computers that stores and distributes data among all participants. Every single participant is a validator and protector of the data in the blockchain system. The data cannot be modified since all participants are storing and watching the exact same records. In this study, we will focus on blockchain applications in swarm robotics using Ethereum smart contracts because blockchain can make a swarm globally connected and secure. A decentralized application (DApp) is used to deploy surveillance missions. After mission deployment, the swarm uses blockchain to communicate and make decisions on appropriate tasks within Ethereum private networks. We conclude that, although blockchain enables a swarm to be globally connected and secure, there are performance limitations that can become a critical issue.","","978-1-7281-8373-2","10.1109/MCNA50957.2020.9264274","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9264274","Swarm robotics;blockchain;Ethereum Geth;surveillance;Edge","Blockchain;Smart contracts;Swarm robotics;Task analysis;Sensors;Supply chains;Robot sensing systems","distributed control;distributed processing;mobile robots;multi-robot systems;particle swarm optimisation;surveillance","surveillance missions deployment;swarm robotics systems;distributed autonomous systems;blockchain system;blockchain applications;mission deployment;swarm uses blockchain;decentralized application;Ethereum smart contracts","","","","19","","23 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

So far, many existing crowd-sourcing applications utilize a central server for deployment, which collects and processes data from a crowd of workers. However, this kind of centralized model also introduces security concerns, including data privacy, integrity of processed data, and single point of failure. In this paper, we propose a secure decentralized framework for truth discovery with a privacy-preserving and reliable realization. Instead of relying on the central servers (e.g., public cloud servers)to behave correctly, our framework delegates the data aggregation and processing tasks to distributed entities, whose behaviors are enforced and verified by utilizing the emerging blockchain-based smart contract technology. Meanwhile, as the blockchain lacks support for on-chain data confidentiality, we utilize the privacy-preserving solution and integrate it with blockchain for privacy protection. Moreover, given the decentralized nature of our framework, it also overcomes the limitation of single point of failure. We implement a prototype of our framework using Ethereum blockchain and demonstrate its practical performance.","","978-1-5386-7117-7","10.1109/CNS.2019.8802712","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8802712","","Blockchain;Task analysis;Smart contracts;Servers;Privacy;Conferences;Crowdsourcing","crowdsourcing;cryptography;data aggregation;data integrity;data privacy;distributed databases","secure decentralized truth discovery;reliable decentralized truth discovery;data privacy;secure decentralized framework;data aggregation;on-chain data confidentiality;privacy-preserving solution;privacy protection;Ethereum blockchain;crowd-sourcing applications;blockchain-based smart contract technology","","3","","27","","19 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A TTP can be a subject to a single point of failure, and it can be disrupted, compromised or hacked. A TTP can potentially misbehave and become corrupt in the future, even if it is trustworthy now.

However, cross-chain interoperability is one of the crucial challenges preventing widespread adoption of blockchain applications. Cross-chain interoperability represents the ability for one blockchain network to interact and share data with another blockchain network. Contemporary cross-chain interoperability solutions are centralized and require re-engineering of the core blockchain stack to enable inter-communication and data sharing among heterogeneous blockchain networks. In this paper, we propose an application-based cross-chain interoperability solution named appXchain which allows blockchain networks of any architecture type and industrial focus to inter-communicate, share data, and make requests. Our solution utilizes the decentralized applications as a distributed translation layer that is capable of communicating and understanding multiple blockchain networks, thereby delegating requests and parameters among them. The architecture uses incentivized verifier nodes that maintain the integrity of shared data facilitating them to be readable by the entities of their network. We define and describe the roles and requirements of major entities of inter-operating blockchain networks in the context of healthcare.

Since these servers are not reliable enough for keeping users' data, remote data auditing mechanisms are studied for mitigating the threat to data integrity. However, many traditional schemes achieve verifiable data integrity for users only without resolutions to data possession disputes, while others depend on centralized third-party auditors (TPAs) for credible arbitrations. Recently, the emergence of blockchain technology promotes inspiring countermeasures. In this article, we propose a decentralized arbitrable remote data auditing scheme for network storage service based on blockchain techniques. We use a smart contract to notarize integrity metadata of outsourced data recognized by users and servers on the blockchain, and also utilize the blockchain network as the self-recording channel for achieving non-repudiation verification interactions. We also propose a fairly arbitrable data auditing protocol with the support of the commutative hash technique, defending against dishonest provers and verifiers. Additionally, a decentralized adjudication mechanism is implemented by using the smart contract technique for creditably resolving data possession disputes without TPAs. The theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation reveal its effectiveness in undisputable data auditing and the limited requirement of costs.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2019.2953033","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61702562,61472451,B18059); Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST(grant numbers:2018QNRC001); Young Talents Plan of Hunan Province of China(grant numbers:2019RS2001); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8907495","Network storage as a service;blockchain;remote data auditing;decentralized arbitration;fair anti-cheating","Blockchain;Servers;Data integrity;Metadata;Smart contracts;Hash functions","auditing;cloud computing;data integrity;meta data;security of data;storage management","remote data auditing mechanisms;verifiable data integrity;credible arbitrations;blockchain technology;decentralized arbitrable remote data auditing scheme;network storage service;blockchain techniques;integrity metadata;outsourced data;blockchain network;fairly arbitrable data;decentralized adjudication mechanism;smart contract technique;data possession;network storage technology;TPA;third-party auditors","","36","","35","IEEE","20 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most existing solutions mainly focus on an honest-but-curious cloud server, while security designs against a malicious server have not drawn enough attention. Although there are a few works addressing the issue of verifiable designs that enable the data owner to verify the integrity of search results. Unfortunately, these verification schemes are not efficient and or applicable from one scenario to another. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose a publicly verifiable search framework for outsourced encrypted data based on blockchain. In our framework, we store the encrypted index in a decentralized blockchain (Ethereum) while outsourcing the corresponding encrypted data to the cloud or Interplanetary File System (IPFS). Thus, once a user is authorized, he/she can get the query results and check the query integrity efficiently by the designed smart contract anytime without data owner being online. Besides, to guarantee the privacy of the data user in the Ethereum, we construct a stealth authorization scheme to achieve access authorization delivery. The security analysis and performance evaluation show that the proposed scheme is secure and practical for verification of encrypted data.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-8088-9","10.1109/ICC.2019.8761146","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8761146","","Cryptography;Indexes;Cloud computing;Smart contracts;Servers;Authorization","authorisation;cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;outsourcing","privacy-preserving framework;outsourced encrypted data;honest-but-curious cloud server;data owner;publicly verifiable search framework;encrypted index;decentralized blockchain;data user;security analysis;verifiable search;encrypted data;performance evaluation;smart contract;Ethereum;interplanetary file system;IPFS;stealth authorization scheme","","4","","17","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, when applied to wireless communications, the performance of BC remains unknown, especially if running over contention-based networks. In this paper, we evaluate the latency performance of BC technology when the supporting communication platform is wireless, specifically we focus on IEEE 802.11ax, for the use case of users’ radio resource provisioning.

However, none of them are practical enough, as they either require some time-consuming cryptographic operations to achieve fairness between the user and worker, or cannot allow the user to outsource arbitrary polynomial to the worker, or need two non-collusive workers. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new outsourcing polynomial computation scheme by employing a variant of Horners method and the blockchain technology. Specifically, the former makes the computational cost on the worker side as low as possible, and the latter guarantees the fairness between the user and worker if the computing result can be publicly verified. To achieve the public verifiability property, we apply the sampling technique, which is effective in our proposal according to a game-theoretic analysis. Furthermore, we implement a prototype of our proposal and run it on an Ethereum test net.

In order to provide uninterrupted service to a cognitive cellular user, we propose elastic handoff as a composite framework of conventional cellular and voluntary spectrum handoffs. As with spectrum handoff, elastic handoff grants secondary users spectrum access while insulating them against the arrival of primary users. On the other hand, it is similar to cellular handoff in providing secondary users service assurance. The setup also offers users multiple network access choices, and affords carriers the means to generate additional revenue by capitalizing on excess capacity. We use a blockchain-based spectrum exchange and smart contracts to implement elastic handoff.

Moreover, we propose an aggregation strategy to verify and aggregate model parameters to ensure the accuracy of decision tree models. Finally, based on the SM2 public key cryptosystem, we protect data security and prevent data privacy leakage in edge services. Theoretical analysis and simulation experiments indicate that the BML-ES framework is secure, effective, and efficient, and is better suitable to improve the accuracy of edge services in IIoT.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2021.3097131","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1836205,U1905211,61772008,61872088,61662009); Science and Technology Major Support Program of Guizhou Province(grant numbers:20183001); Science and Technology Program of Guizhou Province(grant numbers:[2019]1098); Project of High-level Innovative Talents of Guizhou Province(grant numbers:[2020]6008); Project of Innovative Group in Guizhou Education Department(grant numbers:[2013]09); Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province(grant numbers:2019J01276); Guangxi Key Laboratory of Cryptography, and Information Security(grant numbers:GCIS202105); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9484832","Blockchain;edge services;Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT);machine learning;smart contract","Blockchain;Smart devices;Industrial Internet of Things;Data models;Computational modeling;Data processing;Task analysis","","","","","","46","IEEE","14 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Numerous cities around the world are launching blockchain initiatives as part of the overall efforts toward shaping the urban future. However, the infancy stage of the blockchain industry leads to a severe gap between the knowledge we have and the actions urban policy makers are taking. This paper is an effort to narrow this rift. We provide a systematic literature review on concrete blockchain use cases proposed by the research community. At the macro-level, we discuss and organize use cases from 159 selected papers into nine sectors recognized as crucial for sustainable and smart urban future. At the micro-level, we identify a component-based framework and analyze the design and prototypes of blockchain systems studied in a subset of 71 papers. The high-level use case review allows us to illustrate the relationship between them and the four pillars of urban sustainability: social, economic, environmental, and governmental. The system level analysis helps us highlight interesting inconsistencies between well-known blockchain applicability decision rules and the approaches taken by the literature. We also offer two classification methodologies for blockchain use cases and elaborate on how they can be applied to stimulate cross-sector insights in the blockchain knowledge domain.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2880744","Kong Family and Zhao Family Gifts; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8531608","Bitcoin;blockchain;computer networks;consensus;crypto token;distributed computing;Ethereum;Hyperledger Fabric;systematic literature review;smart city;smart contract;system analysis and design;peer-to-peer computing;urban sustainability;use case","Peer-to-peer computing;Urban areas;Bitcoin;Bibliographies;Sustainable development","cryptocurrencies;environmental economics;government policies;reviews;socio-economic effects;sustainable development;town and country planning","governmental policy;economic factors;social factors;environmental factors;component-based framework;urban policy makers;blockchain industry;blockchain knowledge domain;urban sustainability;smart urban future;systematic literature review","","16","","263","OAPA","11 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper investigates strategies for load serving entities to hedge against such price risks. Specifically, we compute profit-maximizing portfolios of forward contract and call options as a function of uncertain aggregate user demand and wholesale electricity prices. We compare the profit to the case of Demand Response, where users are offered monetary incentives to temporarily reduce their consumption during periods of supply shortages. Using smart meter data of residential customers in California, we simulate optimal portfolios and derive conditions under which Demand Response outperforms call options and forward contracts. Our analysis suggests that Demand Response becomes more competitive as wholesale electricity prices increase.","","978-1-5090-2873-3","10.1109/CDC.2017.8263665","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8263665","","Forward contracts;Generators;Instruments;Load management;Portfolios;Companies","demand side management;power markets;pricing;smart meters;tariffs","load-serving entities;wholesale electricity market;forward contract;uncertain aggregate user demand;demand response;wholesale electricity prices;hedging strategies;profit-maximizing portfolios;electricity demand;quasifixed residential tariffs;smart meter data;residential customers;California","","5","","18","","22 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Currently, to reduce the maintenance cost of data, personal health records are usually outsourced to a third party such as the cloud service provider. In this case, patients may lose direct control over their personal health records and the semi-trusted cloud service provider may tamper with or reveal personal health records. Therefore, ensuring the privacy and integrity of personal health records and realizing the fine-grained access control are crucial issues when personal health records are shared. As a distributed architecture with decentralized and tamper-proof features, blockchain provides a new way to protect the personal health records sharing system. In this paper, we propose a new personal health records sharing scheme with data integrity verifiable based on blockchain. Aiming at the problems of privacy disclosure, limited keyword search ability and loss of control rights in the process of personal health record sharing, the new scheme uses searchable symmetric encryption and attribute-based encryption techniques to achieve privacy protection, keyword search, and fine-grained access control. Compared with the existing similar schemes, the new scheme allows patients to distribute attribute private key for users, avoiding many security problems caused by the existing of attribute authority in the scheme. Furthermore, the new scheme uses blockchain to manage keys in the scheme, avoiding the single point failure problem of centralized key management. In particular, the new scheme stores the hash values of encrypted personal health records in blockchain, and the related index set is stored in smart contract, which can further improve the efficiency of data integrity verification. Finally, performance evaluation and security analysis indicate that our scheme is secure and feasible for practical use.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2931531","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61572019); Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2016JZ001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8778648","Personal health records;blockchain;smart contract;searchable symmetric encryption;attribute-based encryption;data integrity verification","Encryption;Blockchain;Cloud computing;Servers;Data integrity","authorisation;cloud computing;cryptography;data integrity;data privacy;data protection;medical information systems;outsourcing","blockchain-based personal health records sharing scheme;personal health record sharing;encrypted personal health records;security analysis;performance evaluation;smart contract;data integrity verification;hash values;attribute authority;searchable symmetric encryption;privacy protection;fine-grained access control","","10","","43","CCBY","29 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This article proposes a blockchain-assisted adaptive model, namely SynergyChain, for improving the scalability and decentralization of the prosumer grouping mechanism in the context of peer-to-peer energy trading. Smart contracts are used for storing the transaction information and for the creation of the prosumer groups. SynergyChain integrates a reinforcement learning module to further improve the overall system performance and profitability by creating a self-adaptive grouping technique. The proposed SynergyChain is developed using Python and Solidity and has been tested using Ethereum test nets. The comprehensive analysis using the hourly energy consumption dataset shows a 39.7% improvement in the performance and scalability of the system as compared to the centralized systems.

Organizations need to pay attention to these technologies and keep up to date with the latest ones available because they can bring numerous benefits to the workings of the organization. A technology such as `cloud computing' has replaced the need for an organization to build a data centre, buy hardware, software, and other IT requirements. The use of cloud computing changes considerably the way IT services are used, especially for financial institutions such as banks. In the Sultanate of Oman, a number of banks are adopting cloud computing and experiencing its benefits. Therefore, the aims of the research are to explore their reasons for moving to cloud computing, its implementation in these banks, and how the move to the cloud has impacted their IT departments. To achieve the research aims interviews were conducted with domain experts, and it was found that cloud computing impacts the IT department of banks by shifting the roles and responsibilities of IT employees, and by helping them to focus more on providing better services rather than on technical issues. In addition, it was found that the main reason for moving to the cloud was the cost-saving associated with it. Before implementing cloud computing the banks evaluated the risks and benefits of adopting it, and then they signed a contract with the cloud provider. The implementation of cloud computing in the bank was then the responsibility of the cloud provider. Based on the bank's regulations, each bank found its own way of protecting its data, either by specifying strict SLA, or by signing a nondisclosure agreement.","","978-1-4673-9584-7","10.1109/ICBDSC.2016.7460344","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7460344","cloud computing;financial institutions;technology;technical issues","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Companies;Hardware;Software as a service","bank data processing;cloud computing;contracts;data protection;information technology;personnel;risk analysis","cloud computing impact;Oman Financial institutions;IT services;banks;IT departments;IT employees;cost-saving;risk evaluation;contract;cloud provider;data protection;SLA;nondisclosure agreement","","","","58","","28 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Several new projects have been emerging almost daily, with an impetus that was not seen since the days of the dawn of the Internet. However, the need of being timely on the market and the lack of experience in a brand new field led to epic disasters, such as those of DAO in 2016 and of Parity Ethereum wallet in 2017. Also, there have been several hacks successfully performed on cryptocurrency exchanges, the biggest being those of MtGox in 2014 (350 million US$), Bitfinex in 2016 (72 million US$), and Coincheck in 2017 (400 million US$). The application of sound SE practices to Blockchain software development, both for Smart Contract and generic Blockchain software, might be crucial to the success of this new field. Here the issues are the need for specific analysis and design methods, quality control through testing and metrics, security assessment and overall development process. At the same time, Blockchain development offers new opportunities, such as the certification of empirical data used for experiment; the ability to design processes where developers are paid upon completion of their tasks through Blockchain tokens, after acceptance tests performed using Smart Contracts; and more sound techniques enabling pay-per-use software, again using tokens.","","978-1-5386-5986-1","10.1109/IWBOSE.2018.8327564","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8327564","Blockchain; Smart Contracts; DistributedLedgers","","","","","5","","","","29 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To be effective in identifying and defeating cyber attacks, cyber analysts require novel distributed detection and reaction methodologies based on information security techniques that can automatically analyse incident reports and securely share analysis results between Critical Infrastructure stakeholders. Our goal is to provide solutions in real-time that could replace human input for cyber incident analysis tasks (triage) to classify cyber incident reports, find related reports in a fast and scalable way, eliminate irrelevant information, and automate reporting life- cycle management. Our effective and fast incident management method is based on artificial intelligence and can support cyber analysts in establishing cyber situational awareness, and allow them to quickly adopt suitable countermeasures in the case of an attack. In this paper, we evaluate deep autoencoder neural network supported by Blockchain technology as a system for incident classification and management, and assess its accuracy and performance. This approach should reduce the number of manual operations and save storage space. We used a Blockchain smart contract technique to provide an automated trusted system for incident management workflow that allows automatic acquisition, classification and enrichment of incident data. We demonstrate how the presented techniques can be applied to support incident handling tasks performed by security operation centres.","2325-5374","978-9-9499-9043-6","10.23919/CYCON.2018.8405028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8405028","cyber threat intelligence;neural network;blockchain","Contracts;Tools;Neural networks;Task analysis;Cyberattack","cryptography;neural nets","blockchain based technique;cyber threat intelligence;cyber attacks;information security techniques;cyber incident analysis tasks;artificial intelligence;cyber situational awareness;deep autoencoder neural network;incident classification;incident management workflow;security operation centres;life-cycle management;critical infrastructure protection;distributed detection methodology;distributed reaction methodology;blockchain smart contract technique","","2","","18","","9 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the applications in dimension are limited due to sparse availability of data and computing resources, also the required expertise of data understanding, modeling and training is not common yet. These limitations are forcing a barrier in the widespread use of deep learning applications in healthcare. In this research we propose a decentralized transfer learning mechanism based on smart contracts using private blockchain. The idea is to involve various stakeholders which includes data scientists, deep learning experts, dataset holders and deep learning infrastructure providers into a single trustless deep learning-based analytics system. The framework will allow sharing of data, and expertise in the field of deep learning, along with processing power to solve a single task in a decentralized manner. The sharing mechanism will be based on smart contracts to ensure the intellectual property of an individual remains protected. The framework once deployed on public blockchain can turn transfer learning into a new domain of research and business and will define a new era of shared computing for various domains. The research will directly impact people working in isolation to come together and create opportunities for better analytics and optimized predictions for scientific society.","1976-7684","978-1-7281-4199-2","10.1109/ICOIN48656.2020.9016456","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9016456","Transfer Learning;Deep Learning;blockchain;Intellectual Property;IP Protection","Machine learning;Task analysis;Data models;Training;Medical services","contracts;health care;industrial property;learning (artificial intelligence);private key cryptography;public key cryptography","predictive healthcare;preventive healthcare;deep learning applications;decentralized transfer learning mechanism;smart contracts;deep learning experts;deep learning infrastructure providers;trustless deep learning-based analytics system;IPFS;IPFS;private blockchain;intellectual property","","3","","25","","2 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the current blockchain data supervision is insufficient and the data cannot be modified once it is on the blockchain, which will cause the blockchain system to face various problems such as illegal information cannot be deleted and breach of smart contract cannot be fixed in time. To address these issues, we propose an anonymous editable blockchain scheme based on the reconstruction of the blockchain structure of the SpaceMint combining with the certificateless aggregate signature algorithm. Users register with their real identities and use pseudonyms in the system to achieve their anonymity. If the number of users who agree to edit meets the threshold, the data on the blockchain can be modified or deleted, and our scheme has the function of accountability for malicious behavior. The security analysis show that the proposed certificateless aggregate signature algorithm enjoys the unforgeability under the adaptive selected message attack. Moreover, the method of setting the threshold of related users is adopted to guarantee the effectiveness and security of editing blockchain data. At last, we evaluate the performance of our certificateless aggregate signature algorithm and related schemes in theoretical analysis and experimental simulation, which demonstrates our scheme is feasible and efficient in storage, bandwidth and computational cost.","","978-1-6654-1411-1","10.1109/ICNLP52887.2021.00016","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9537874","editable blockchain;certificateless aggregate signature;accountability;anonymity","Analytical models;Law;Aggregates;Smart contracts;Natural language processing;Blockchains;Registers","blockchains;digital signatures;telecommunication security","anonymous editable blockchain scheme;blockchain technology;traditional centralized data storage methods;people reliable data storage services;blockchain system;blockchain structure;certificateless aggregate signature algorithm;blockchain data supervision;decentralized features;nontamperable features;illegal information;smart contract;SpaceMint;malicious behavior;adaptive selected message attack","","","","28","","17 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper describes a process of forward-contracting for production capacity while considering the full range of operational uncertainties in generation, demand, forecasts, prices, and the risks of unmet demand or excess generation in real time. RLD accounts for reducing uncertainty, increasing costs, and the opportunity for corrective action at future decision points as one approaches that moment. The stochastic formulation of RLD integrates multiple uncertainties into a unified framework and accepts all kinds of probability distributions. This dynamic optimization approach is comprehensive and considers the flexibility of recourse actions taken at later decision stages, when updated information and improved forecasts become available. For instance, Smart Grid sensor data can be used to update the conditional probability distributions in the formulation. A reliability constraint is accommodated directly in terms of the power balance between supply and demand in real time. Alternative quantitative measures of the risk of power imbalance can be incorporated. For example, optimization can be conducted under the requirement that the risk of power imbalance in real time should be less than 0.1% (or any number).","1944-9925","978-1-4673-2729-9","10.1109/PESGM.2012.6344589","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6344589","Wind Energy;Power system economics;Risk analysis;Optimal Control;Optimal scheduling;Stochastic systems","Educational institutions;Uncertainty;Wind forecasting;Reliability;Real-time systems;Economics;Wind power generation","dynamic programming;power generation dispatch;power generation economics;power generation reliability;risk analysis;smart power grids;statistical distributions;stochastic processes;supply and demand","risk limiting dispatch;RLD;forward-contracting process;stochastic formulation;dynamic optimization approach;smart grid sensor data;conditional probability distributions;reliability constraint;power balance;supply and demand","","6","","6","","10 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, we need to protect user's privacy when broadcasting the message. Second, participants usually lack the enthusiasm to reply to the announcement. To solve these two problems, we propose a novel blockchain-based incentive announcement system that not only allows participants to anonymously announce their message on the blockchain in a non-trusted environment, but also motivates witnesses to respond to the request of the traffic information with incentive mechanism.

Owing to its immutability property and consensus protocol, blockchain offers a new solution for trusted storage and computation services. To scale up the services, prior research has suggested a hybrid storage architecture, where only small meta-data are stored onchain and the raw data are outsourced to off-chain storage. To protect data integrity, a cryptographic proof can be constructed online for queries over the data stored in the system. However, the previous schemes only support simple key-value queries. In this paper, we take the first step toward studying authenticated range queries in the hybrid-storage blockchain. The key challenge lies in how to design an authenticated data structure (ADS) that can be efficiently maintained by the blockchain, in which a unique gas cost model is employed. By analyzing the performance of the existing techniques, we propose a novel ADS, called GEM<sup>2</sup>-tree, which is not only gas-efficient but also effective in supporting authenticated queries. To further reduce the ADS maintenance cost without sacrificing much the query performance, we also propose an optimized structure, GEM<sup>2</sup>*-tree, by designing a two-level index structure. Theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation validate the performance of the proposed ADSs.","2375-026X","978-1-5386-7474-1","10.1109/ICDE.2019.00080","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8731412","Blockchain;Smart contract;Range query;Authenticated query","Blockchain;Smart contracts;Cryptography;Data structures;Indexes;Data models","cryptography;data integrity;data structures;distributed databases;outsourcing;query processing;storage management","gas-efficient structure;authenticated range queries;blockchain technology;immutability property;consensus protocol;trusted storage;hybrid storage architecture;meta-data;data integrity;hybrid-storage blockchain;authenticated data structure;unique gas cost model;ADS maintenance cost;GEM2-tree","","6","","36","","6 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cloud Computing achieves coherence and economic of scale by means of shared resources. The growth of cloud computing depends on the high availability of low cost computers, storage devices and networks as well as hardware virtualization and utility computing. Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a service commitment tool between a cloud service provider and a cloud customer. Using SLA in cloud computing, reduce the chances of disappointing the cloud customer and manage the expectation between the service provider and the customer. The challenge is, it is very difficult to handle all request by the cloud providers at a time during peak hours and to keep up SLA. So when there is an uneven request arrival pattern, the cloud resources may either be underutilized or over-utilized. In order to balance the load, the load balancer plays the major role in cloud computing. The load balancing algorithm equalizes the workload and computing resources in a cloud computing environment. It allows an organization to manage their workload demands by allocating resources among multiple servers and thus it minimizes the response time, minimize the waiting time, maximize the throughput time, maximize the resource utilization and minimize the communication delays of the server by meeting the SLA. The major goal of this study is to review both the existing static and dynamic load balancing algorithms proposed till now and to design and implement a Load balancer that uses a Meta Heuristics approach - Ant Colony Optimization technique to perform balancing the load so that the SLA is met evenly without any issues. Each of the load balancing algorithms is compared with other algorithms theoretically and experimentally one of it is tested with the proposed system using AWS Cloud PaaS (Platform as a Service).","","978-1-5386-9432-9","10.1109/I2C2SW45816.2018.8997138","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8997138","AWS PaaS;Cloud Computing;Load Balancing;Service Level Agreement;Static and Dynamic Load Balancing","Cloud computing;Load management;Heuristic algorithms;Servers;Prediction algorithms;Task analysis;Round robin","ant colony optimisation;cloud computing;contracts;resource allocation;virtualisation","load balancing algorithms;SLA;AWS Cloud PaaS;hardware virtualization;utility computing;cloud service provider;cloud resources;cloud computing;public cloud-service provider;service level agreement;metaheuristics approach;ant colony optimization technique","","","","9","","13 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing data auditing schemes have done a lot of work in terms of functionality, implementation, and security. As we can see, all of these schemes are based on the auditing framework proposed by Ateniese et al., which uses random sampling to probabilistically check whether the data is integrity or not. But multiple repeated sampling may lead to an intersection between the challenge sets selected each time, reducing the probability of detection, and the time for detecting corrupted blocks will be indefinite. If the corrupted data is not found for a long time, the data remedial measures will become invalid, resulting in permanent data loss. To address the above problem, we designed an efficient sampling verification algorithm. Based on this algorithm, the auditing scheme is further optimized, and a dynamic auditing function has been developed for the scheme to facilitate data owners to update data. Through the security analysis, our scheme is soundness.

Hence, we seek refuge to blockchain technology to eradicate such third parties and facilitate a transparent and automated pay per use licensing mechanism. A blockchain is a distributed public ledger whose records are added based on peer review and majority consensus of its participants, that cannot be tampered or modified later.

In previous works we quantitatively evaluated the performance of five interaction models devised with industrial partners using the agent-based testbed DSIMA. Simulation results showed that these interaction models relying on active network management suffer from a lack of coordination between the distribution and the transmission system operator, activating flexibility simultaneously in opposite directions. This paper introduces a new interaction model fixing this issue based on dynamic access bounds to the network changing throughout the day and preventing the activation of flexibility leading to congestions. This new interaction model is implemented in DSIMA and compared to a model restricting the grid users to a very restrictive but safe access range. Results show that this new model allows to safely increase by 55 % the amount of distributed generation in the network.","","978-1-5090-3358-4","10.1109/ISGTEurope.2016.7856191","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7856191","distribution networks;market design;load flexibility;demand-side management;agent-based model;smart grid","Dynamic range;Load modeling;Proposals;Contracts;Computational modeling;Analytical models;Power system dynamics","demand side management;distributed power generation;distribution networks;power grids","distribution network;interaction model;agent-based testbed DSIMA;active network management;transmission system operator;distribution system operator;power grid;distributed generation","","4","","11","","16 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It was observed that millions of people become ill or die from eating infected, spoiled, or intoxicated food and that these problems are directly linked to the registration and communication areas of the participants in the supply chain. It was concluded that combining technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Blockchain is an extremely attractive option for the transparent tracking of food from its production to its sale and consumption; likewise, using smart contracts ensures compliance with all the conditions necessary for its consumption. Finally, it should be mentioned that, by being able to track in seconds, the reduction of time and operating costs is imminent.","","978-1-7281-9377-9","10.1109/INTERCON50315.2020.9220244","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9220244","Blockchain;food;salubrity;social programs;traceability","","contracts;cost reduction;cryptography;distributed databases;food processing industry;food safety;Internet of Things;production engineering computing;supply chain management","blockchain;digital food traceability;transparent food traceability;Peruvian social programs;food industry;communication areas;registration areas;supply chain;internet of things;operating costs reduction;smart contracts","","","","23","","12 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unfortunately, behind its potentials, blockchain also possessed many challenges and limitations. The highlighted problem is the usability aspect of blockchain technology examined from developer and user perspective. This paper tried to address this problem by proposing query functionalities, with the help of query layer system, to facilitate the developer and the user to access blockchain data easily. There are three main query functionalities that will be discussed in this paper: (1) finding blockchain data based on multiple search parameters (retrieval query), (2) providing simple statistical analysis from a collection of blockchain data (aggregate query) and (3) sorting blockchain data according to its blockchain component (ranking query). For the implementation stage, Ethereum is used as platform to provide blockchain network, MongoDB is used as cloud storage service and REST API is used as web services. For the testing stage, throughput and time response are used to evaluate the performance of the developed query functionalities in the query layer system. The results are: (1) the throughput of query layer system is lower than Ethereum service for blockchain data retrieval and (2) the time response of query layer system is affected by the number of thread and the amount of data stored in cloud storage.","","978-1-5386-6670-8","10.1109/ISESD.2018.8605476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8605476","blockchain;query;Ethereum;cloud storage","Blockchain;Usability;Cloud computing;Bitcoin;Contracts;Synchronization;Web services","application program interfaces;cloud computing;cryptography;distributed databases;query processing;statistical analysis;Web services","blockchain technology;query layer system;multiple search parameters;retrieval query;aggregate query;blockchain component;ranking query;blockchain network;blockchain data retrieval;query support;data processing;Ethereum blockchain;query functionalities","","","","13","","10 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some even believe that basically everything can be tokenized, meaning that it can be represented by a tradable digital token. With decentralized P2P networks that hold and distribute the tokens, one can build various decentralized applications around them. As a digital asset on top of a cryptocurrency, crypto tokens are managed by a smart contract, most commonly on Ethereum. A widespread high-level categorization of tokens distinguishes between payment tokens, security tokens, and utility tokens. The need for clarifying the differences lies in the fact that in most jurisdictions, security tokens are more heavily regulated than other tokens. In this work, we contribute to the detection and classification of crypto tokens from bytecode. First, we examine how ideas on regulation are currently incorporated into respective standards. Then, we discuss methods for identifying deployed token contracts from bytecode. Furthermore, we analyze deployed contracts regarding the standards to which they comply, and the type of token they may represent. Moreover, we investigate the actual usage of tokens.

Utilizing the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and smart contracts, BlockRoam can significantly shorten the information exchanging delay, thereby addressing the roaming fraud problems. Through intensive analysis, we show that the security and performance of such PoS-based blockchain network can be further enhanced by incentivizing more users (e.g., subscribers) to participate in the network. Moreover, users in such networks often join stake pools (e.g., formed by MSPs) to increase their profits. Therefore, we develop an economic model based on Stackelberg game to jointly maximize the profits of the network users and the stake pool, thereby encouraging user participation.

In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized blockchain-based medical data marketplace in which medical record sellers can sell their data to interested buyers, e.g., pharmaceutical corporations. Sellers use a smart contract to exchange their records with buyers for a digital currency. In our model, sellers can enforce flexible access control policy on the encrypted records while allowing the buyers to verify the correctness of the encrypted records without revealing any information about the records using the developed zk-SNARK protocol.

A dual storage structure of “database + blockchain” on-chain and off-chain traceability information is constructed to reduce load pressure of the chain and realize efficient information query.

Sharing health data is considered to be a critical approach to improve the quality of healthcare service and reduce medical costs. However, EMRs are fragmented across decentralized hospitals, which hinders data sharing and puts patients' privacy at risks. To address these issues, we propose a blockchain based privacy-preserving data sharing for EMRs, called BPDS. In BPDS, the original EMRs are stored securely in the cloud and the indexes are reserved in a tamper-proof consortium blockchain. By this means, the risk of the medical data leakage could be greatly reduced, and at the same time, the indexes in blockchain ensure that the EMRs can not be modified arbitrarily. Secure data sharing can be accomplished automatically according to the predefined access permissions of patients through the smart contracts of blockchain. Besides, the joint-design of the CP-ABE-based access control mechanism and the content extraction signature scheme provides strong privacy preservation in data sharing. Security analysis shows that BPDS is a secure and effective way to realize data sharing for EMRs.","2576-6813","978-1-5386-4727-1","10.1109/GLOCOM.2018.8647713","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8647713","","Blockchain;Medical services;Data privacy;Smart contracts;Cloud computing;Access control","authorisation;cloud computing;data privacy;distributed databases;electronic health records;health care;hospitals","BPDS;EMR;blockchain based privacy-preserving data sharing;electronic medical record;healthcare data;tamper-proof consortium blockchain;medical data leakage;hospitals;smart contract;CP-ABE-based access control mechanism;content extraction signature scheme","","36","","21","","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The classic example, McKibben muscles, is part of a broader class of cylindrical soft actuators known as fiber-reinforced elastomeric enclosures (FREEs). These actuators can be designed to twist while extending or contracting. Using a circuit of conductive, electrically insulated wire as the reinforcing fibers allows one to measure the motion of the actuator with the circuit inductance. These sensors, developed previously for McKibben muscles, are known as “Smart Braids.” This paper extends the concept of Smart Braids to the broader class of two-fiber-family cylindrical FREEs. A dimensionless model for the inductance of Smart Braid FREEs is presented that can be scaled to specific sensor geometries. This model depends only on the ratio of the fiber lengths in the two families and the angle of one of the fibers. The model was validated both numerically and experimentally, predicting the sensitivity of experimental sensors accurately, the largest errors being -11% and 9%. The model presented in this paper will enable high-level design decisions for Smart Braid FREES and optimization without computationally expensive direct numerical simulation.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2018.2802640","Toyota Research Institute; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship(grant numbers:DGE 1256260); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8281451","Pneumatic actuators;soft robotics;electromechanical sensors;inductive transducers;intelligent actuators;hydraulic actuators","Actuators;Inductance;Intelligent sensors;Geometry;Numerical models;Muscles","elastomers;electroactive polymer actuators;fibre reinforced composites;muscle;numerical analysis;pneumatic actuators","fiber-reinforced elastomeric enclosures;inextensible fibers;elastomeric fluid;McKibben muscles;cylindrical soft actuators;reinforcing fibers;circuit inductance;dimensionless model;specific sensor geometries;fiber lengths;high-level design decisions;smart braid inductance sensors;two-fiber-family cylindrical FREE;smart braid FREE","","4","","30","IEEE","5 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper studies the outsourcing strategy considering patent licensing in an electronic product supply chain composed of a patent-holding firm, an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and a contract manufacturer (CM). In addition to outsourcing manufacturing to the CM, OEM also considers outsourcing the patent license obtaining as well. We construct two outsourcing modes, called Turnkey and Consignment. No matter under which outsourcing mode, the patent-holding firm will charge unit royalty and a fixed fee paid in a lump sum. The results show that the OEM tends to choose Consignment without considering fixed fees, while the CM prefers Turnkey. When considering fixed fees, the patent-holding firm could align their preferences by coordinating fixed fees borne by OEM and CM. What's more, considering the environmental pollution caused by the production of electronic products, both strategies may lead to higher social welfare than the other strategy.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2996947","Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71774019,71803197); Talent Project of Revitalizing Liaoning(grant numbers:XLYC1807097); Ministry of Education Project of Humanities and Social Sciences(grant numbers:18YJC630094); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:31511910801); Soft Science Project of Technological Innovation in Hubei Province(grant numbers:2019ADC029); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9099291","OEM;patent licensing;outsourcing;coopetition supply chain","Patents;Licenses;Outsourcing;Supply chains;Manufacturing","contracts;electronic products;electronics industry;industrial pollution;outsourcing;patents;risk analysis;smart phones;supply chain management;supply chains","consignment;social welfare;turnkey;environmental pollution;contract manufacturer;infringement risks;smartphone;outsourcing manufacturing;original equipment manufacturer;electronics industry;outsourcing production activities;electronic product supply chain;patent licensing;patent-holding firm;OEM","","","","35","CCBY","25 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, mobile virtual network operators who provide data plans to their own customers at retail prices have emerged in the mobile market. In today's mobile market, customers can therefore choose their preferred data plan from a number of alternatives. There is, however, limited knowledge about how sensitively customers react to changed pricing for a data plan. In this paper, we focus on tiered data plans, i.e., specific pairing of price and data capacity, and empirically analyze the utility for customers of the tiered data plans by applying choice-based conjoint analysis.

Although many existing proposals and industrial tools support the definition of pricing and billing of cloud services, there is a lack in terms of customisation and automated monitoring tools integrated with the billing process. In this article, we provide a flexible billing proposal supporting CA that considers not only SLA terms but also customisable pricing and billing terms, possibly including compensations (i.e. discounts or overcharges) that apply when specified conditions are met. In addition, we developed an automated monitoring and analysis tool that we validate in a real-world industrial scenario.

Emergency message dissemination is usually carried out by broadcasting. However, high vehicle density and mobility lead to challenges in message dissemination such as broadcasting storm and low probability of packet reception. This paper proposes a federated learning based blockchain-assisted message dissemination solution. Similar to the incentive-based Proof-of-Work consensus in blockchain, vehicles compete to become a relay node (miner) by processing the proposed Proofof-Federated-Learning (PoFL) consensus which is embedded in the smart contract of blockchain. Both theoretical and practical analysis of the proposed solution are provided. Specifically, the proposed blockchain based federated learning results in more vehicles uploading their models in a given time, which can potentially lead to a more accurate model in less time as compared to the same solution without using blockchain. It also outperforms other blockchain approaches in reducing 65.2% of time delay in consensus, improving at least 8.2% message delivery rate and preserving privacy of neighbour vehicle more efficiently. The economic model to incentivize vehicles participating in federated learning and message dissemination is further analysed using Stackelberg game. The analysis of asymptotic complexity proves PoFL as the most scalable solution compared to other consensus algorithms in vehicular networks.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2021.3132226","Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality(grant numbers:L191001); Agency for Science Technology and Research(grant numbers:A19D6a0053); Newton Advanced Fellowship(grant numbers:62061130221); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61822101,62173012,U20A20155); H2020 Marie Skodowska-Curie Actions(grant numbers:101006411); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9633160","blockchain;federated learning;smart contract","Biological system modeling;Blockchains;Relays;Fuzzy logic;Economics;Data models;Analytical models","","","","","","","IEEE","2 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Nevertheless, in application of DR programs, there are many uncertain factors which cannot be reflected in conventional optimization approaches. In this paper, the interruptible load optimization is carried out considering the uncertainties of customer response and total interruptible capacity requirement. The probability distribution of customer response can be deduced according to historical data. So the expected value of settling accounts as compensation or penalty to customers is calculated and minimized as one of the objective functions. The sum of variances is minimized as another objective function. The uncertainty of total interruptible capacity requirement is considered in the constraints, which is described as the confidence level. This optimization problem is called chance constrained programming because of the random variables in the constraints, which can be transformed to its deterministic equivalents. Example analysis demonstrates that the proposed optimization method can consider the coordination of economy and reliability in interrupting the customer loads and satisfy the confidence level.","2378-8542","978-1-4799-1300-8","10.1109/ISGT-Asia.2014.6873873","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6873873","Demand Response;Interruptible Load;Uncertainty analysis;Chance constrained programming","Optimization;Uncertainty;Biological system modeling;Asia;Contracts;Load modeling;Probabilistic logic","constraint handling;consumer behaviour;demand side management;optimisation;probability;supply and demand;uncertainty handling","deterministic equivalent;random variable;chance constrained programming;optimization problem;confidence level;probability distribution;total interruptible capacity requirement;customer response;interruptible load optimization;alternative energy source;demand side resource;power supply;power demand;DR program;smart grid;demand response program;uncertain optimization decision","","4","","15","","11 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The overall framework could be characterized as a secure, stochastic, combined unit commitment and AC optimal power flow problem, solving for an optimal state-dependent schedule over a pre-specified time horizon. Uncertainty is modeled to expose the scenarios that are critical for maintaining system security, while properly representing the stochastic cost. The optimal amount of locational reserves needed to cover a credible set of contingencies in each time period is determined, as well as load-following reserves required for ramping between time periods. The models for centrally-dispatched storage and time-flexible demands allow for optimal tradeoffs between arbitraging across time, mitigating uncertainty and covering contingencies. This paper details the proposed problem formulation and outlines potential approaches to solving it. An implementation based on a DC power flow model solves systems of modest size and can be used to demonstrate the value of the proposed stochastic framework.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2013.2281001","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6670209","Energy storage;optimization;power engineering computing;power generation dispatch;power system analysis computing;power system economics;power system planning;power system reliability;power system simulation;renewable energy sources;smart grids;uncertainty;wind energy","Energy storage;Uncertainty;Planning;Stochastic processes;Optimization;Contracts;Indexes","energy consumption;energy storage;load flow;load shedding;power generation dispatch;power generation planning;power system security","systems secure planning;systems secure operations;stochastic optimization framework;electricity network;independent system operator;planning horizon;electricity consumption;ancillary services;electricity generation;load-shedding;load-shifting;combined unit commitment;AC optimal power flow problem;optimal state-dependent schedule;system security;stochastic cost;centrally-dispatched storage;time-Ωexible demands;optimal tradeoffs;DC power flow model;stochastic framework;active demand","","100","","21","","25 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

More seriously, the cloud-based centralized management mode is vulnerable to cyber-attacks, which usually leads to privacy leakage. However, previous studies seldom focus on the privacy issue of the charging system for EVs. In this article, a decentralized and privacy-preserving charging scheme for EVs is proposed, which is based on blockchain and fog computing. In this scheme, fog computing is introduced to provide local computing with low latency. Specifically, a fog computing network, which is composed of fog computing nodes (FCNs), is used to provide localized services. Besides, a flexible consortium blockchain architecture is proposed. The blockchain system is deployed on the distributed FCNs, providing a decentralized and secure storage environment.

The aim of this paper is to outsource network coverage of a specific area according to a desired quality of service requirement and to enable various entities in the network to have intelligence to make autonomous decisions using blockchain and auction mechanisms. In this regard, by considering a multiple-UAV network where each UAV is associated to its own controlling operator, this paper addresses two major challenges: the selection of the UAV for the desired quality of network coverage and the development of a distributed and autonomous real-time monitoring framework for the enforcement of service level agreement (SLA). For a suitable UAV selection, we employ a reputation-based auction mechanism to model the interaction between the business agent who is interested in outsourcing the network coverage and the UAV operators serving in closeby areas. In addition, theoretical analysis is performed to show that the proposed auction mechanism attains a dominant strategy equilibrium.

The decentralized feature of blockchain overcomes the security and data reliability issues in IoT. However, on the other hand supply chain disruptions are causing huge impact on the logistics network. For creating resilient logistics network, all the parties across the supply chain (beyond tier 1) must be collaborated in order to trust each stakeholder. Based on these issues I devised two research questions: Research methods include preliminary analysis of the literature review for theoretical knowledge.

The current approach for IoT data trading relies on a centralized third-party entity to negotiate between data consumers and data providers, which is inefficient and insecure on a large scale. In comparison, a decentralized approach based on distributed ledger technologies (DLT) enables data trading while ensuring trust, security, and privacy. However, due to the lack of understanding of the communication efficiency between sellers and buyers, there is still a significant gap in benchmarking the data trading protocols in IoT environments. Motivated by this knowledge gap, we introduce a model for DLT-based IoT data trading over the narrowband Internet-of-Things (NB-IoT) system, intended to support massive environmental sensing.

This technology has the ability to run smart contracts as well as register users. There are several consensus algorithms used in blockchains. Many researchers are looking into the consensus algorithm in order to ensure the security and authenticity of transaction information in blockchains. In determining which consensus algorithm research areas should be examined, several existing papers from other researchers have been analyzed. This study is motivated by the need to determine the best consensus key. Thus, this study will examine the comparison of the two consensus algorithms which are Proof of Stake (PoS) and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) algorithms. A further focus of this research study is on the parameters that are being used by these two algorithms. Analyses are done based on the number of miners and the number of created blocks to determine how long is necessary to produce a new block. The measurements were conducted through the simulation tool, which is Ethereum in a private network. The impact of parameters was assessed and analyzed based on the results. In addition, we conclude by determining their scalability as well as their efficiency. As the results show, DPoS is much better than PoS when it comes to producing a new block, with a percentage difference of 68%-73% between them. For future work, the algorithm studied can be extended to the Dual Delegated Proof of Stake (DDPoS) and the relationship and comparison between Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) and Dual Delegated Proof of Stake (DDPoS) can be discussed. Furthermore, the key parameters of the analysis can be extended as well such as the power of the consumptions.","","978-1-6654-4303-6","10.1109/ICoDSA53588.2021.9617549","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9617549","blockchain;consensus;PoS;DPoS","Scalability;Software algorithms;Smart contracts;Consensus algorithm;Tools;Time measurement;Blockchains","","","","","","18","","3 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional machine learning-based intelligent control methods are restricted by insufficient data. Owing to lacking effective incentives and trust, data from different urban rail lines or operators cannot be shared directly. In this paper, we propose a distributed federal learning method for accurate prediction of rail transit passenger flow based on blockchain. The proposed method performs distributed machine learning without a trusted central server. The blockchain smart contract is used to realize the management of the entire federal learning. Considering the limitations of the traditional time series model, we choose the distributed long and short term memory (LSTM) networks as the supervised learning model for passenger flow prediction. In addition, we establish an incentive mechanism to reward those participants who contribute to the model.

With the advancement in technologies, the use of IoTs devices also increases. However, security risks regarding service provisioning and data sharing also increases. There are many existing security approaches. However, these approaches are not suitable for IoTs devices due to their limited storage and computation resources. These secure approaches also require a specific hardware. With the invention of blockchain technologies, many security risks are eliminated. Blockchain also supports data sharing mechanism. In this paper, we proposed a secure service providing mechanism for IoTs using blockchain. We introduced cloud nodes for maintaining the validity states of edge service providers. The edge node reputation is considered as a service rating given by end users. Incentive is given to edge servers after validation of service codes. Incentive is in the form of cryptocurrency. Incentive and edge node reputation values are stored in cloud node and are updated with respect to time. Smart contract is proposed to check the validity state of the edge servers. Smart contract is also used for the comparison and verification of the service codes provided by edge servers.

Currently, the data collection is done either manual or unsupervised that poses trust, legitimacy and accuracy issues such as duplicated or falsified vehicular data records, tampered safety checks and meddled driving history, etc. Hence, a strong tool that can protect the vehicular data; log the changes for audit purposes and eventually build the trust in the system is necessary. We propose the use of blockchain technology for these needs. The proposed solution involves connecting an IoT module to a car data port to collect rich telemetric data; analyze the driving behaviors on various fronts and storing the outcomes to a blockchain.

IoT is bringing new wireless sensor use cases by taking advantage of the computing power and flexibility provided by Edge and Cloud Computing. However, the software and hardware resources used within such applications must perform correctly and optimally. Especially in applications where a failure of resources can be critical. Service Level Agreements (SLA) where the performance requirements of such applications are defined, need to be specified in a standard way that reflects the end-to-end nature of IoT application domains, accounting for the Quality of Service (QoS) metrics within every layer including the Edge, Network Gateways, and Cloud. In this paper, we propose a conceptual model that captures the key entities of an SLA and their relationships, as a prior step for end-to-end SLA specification and composition. Service level objective (SLO) terms are also considered to express the QoS constraints. Moreover, we propose a new SLA grammar which considers workflow activities and the multi-layered nature of IoT applications. Accordingly, we develop a tool for SLA specification and composition that can be used as a template to generate SLAs in a machine-readable format. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed specification language through a literature survey that includes an SLA language comparison analysis, and via reflecting the user satisfaction results of a usability study.","","978-1-5386-7879-4","10.1109/HPCS.2018.00147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8514452","","Quality of service;Monitoring;Real-time systems;Cloud computing;Measurement;Hardware;Internet of Things","cloud computing;contracts;distributed processing;grammars;health care;Internet of Things;internetworking;quality of service;smart cities;specification languages","edge computing;user satisfaction;network gateways;QOS;quality of service;smart cities;end-to-end service level agreement specification;software resources;cloud computing;SLA language comparison analysis;SLA grammar;hardware resources;wireless sensor use cases;environmental monitoring;healthcare monitoring;IoT application","","1","","26","","1 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this context, guarantees that the computational results are delivered within the promised time and budget must be provided despite the limited information available about the location and ownership of resources. Providers might claim to execute the services to get compensated for the computation even though returning incomplete or incorrect results. In this paper, we define a model to predict provider reliability, that is, the probability of failure-free execution of computational tasks and correctness of the computed outputs, by extracting the potential dependencies between providers from historical log traces. This model can then be utilized in the definition of provider reputation or the scheduling of new services. Indeed, we propose a probabilistic scheduler that chooses the providers that meet the reliability constraints among others. Finally, we validate the proposed solutions with real traces from a decentralized cloud provider and hint at the benefits of predicting reliability in this context.","","978-1-7281-6095-5","10.1109/CCGrid49817.2020.00-91","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9139618","Cloud Computing;Reliability;Smart Contracts;Distributed Ledgers;Blockchain;Distributed Management","Task analysis;Reliability;Contracts;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Predictive models","cloud computing;cryptography;distributed databases;probability","reliability management;blockchain-based decentralized multicloud;cloud infrastructure costs;geographically distributed providers;computational resources;provider reliability;computational tasks;provider reputation;decentralized cloud provider","","1","","34","","14 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose EduRSS, a blockchain-based storage and sharing scheme for educational records is proposed, which combines blockchain, storage servers, and cryptography techniques to create a reliable and safe environment. In our proposal, the blockchain technology is used to ensure the security and reliability of data storage, while the smart contracts on the blockchain are used to regulate the process of storage and sharing. More precisely, the off-chain storage servers store the original educational records in encrypted form, while the hash information of the records is stored on the blockchain. The off-chain records are anchored periodically with the hash information on the blockchain to ensure the security of data storage. Cryptography techniques are utilized to handle records encryption and messages digital signature. To assess the effectiveness of EduRSS, we designed and tested a proof of concept of this scheme.

However, the proliferation of blockchain technology has led to the need of supporting transactions across multiple networks requiring interoperability. Thus far, minimal analysis has been dedicated to the interoperability scenario and in particular the prevention of double-spending attacks across interoperable blockchain networks. In this paper, we propose the use of neutral observers to monitor transactions that span multiple blockchains and design a protocol that obviates the double-spending problem across interoperable blockchain networks. We show that the observers, can detect double spending, while remaining honest to the protocol as it is more profitable to them than colluding due to our proposed disincentivization scheme. Leveraging Ethereum's smart-contract functionality, we simulate our proposed disincentivization scheme and show its cost-effectiveness.","","978-1-7281-6741-1","10.1109/TPS-ISA48467.2019.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9014380","blockchains;interoperable-blockchains;cryptocurrency;double spending;game theory;ethereum;smart contracts;attacks;cyber security","Observers;Peer-to-peer computing;Contracts;Interoperability;Game theory;Servers","computer crime;cryptocurrencies;cryptographic protocols;data privacy;open systems","disincentivization scheme;double spending;double-spending problem;multiple blockchains;interoperable blockchain networks;double-spending attacks;interoperability scenario;interoperability;blockchain technology;decentralized cryptocurrency applications;interoperable blockchains;double spend attacks","","1","","67","","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The increasing scale and scope of applications make a great demand of IoT data exchange in recent years. Meanwhile, a number of IoT data exchange platforms which dedicated to connecting various and distributed data sources are emerging. In such a platform, service providers can search and exchange the data sets that they need. However, the centralized infrastructure cannot provide enough trust as the third-party intermediaries for data exchange. As a result, most platforms unable to satisfy the complex requirements due to few institutions and individuals are willing to share their IoT data sets in such an untrustworthy environment. This paper proposes a decentralized solution based on the blockchain for IoT data trusted exchange. Specifically, In this paper, the basic principles of blockchain and corresponding key technologies are expounded through in-depth analysis of three main reliable requirements in IoT data exchange. Besides, this paper provides an architecture of above solution and detailed design of its main trust component. Finally, it realizes a prototype by using Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts and presents its auditable, transparent, decentralized features visually.","","978-1-5090-6352-9","10.1109/CompComm.2017.8322729","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8322729","IoT data;Trusted Exchange;Blockchain;Smart Contracts","Contracts;Data privacy;Permission;Peer-to-peer computing;Cloud computing;Electronic mail","electronic data interchange;Internet of Things;security of data;trusted computing","untrustworthy environment;Internet of Things;IoT data trusted exchange;Ethereum blockchain;decentralized solution;IoT data sets;distributed data sources;IoT data exchange platforms","","20","","23","","26 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular traditional energy trading systems provide a centralized approach and connectivity among the different participating trusted users. Recently Blockchain Technology shows a potential solution to address critical challenges such as gapped communications, security in an untrusted decentralized environment, inefficient transactions retrieval (low throughput, high latency, high CPU and memory utilization, etc.), and scattered energy records. In this paper a framework is proposed, to record the energy transactions, a JavaScript-based smart contract is deployed over the Hyperledger Sawtooth Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET). Additionally, the proposed framework is shown as a working prototype, and the performances are evaluated taking transaction per second, read and write latency, read write throughput, the number of successful and failed transactions, CPU utilization, network traffic input, and output. Also, it is shown that PoET's performance is better than PoW for multi-hosting environments. It has been observed that out of 1000 transactions sent for each round by clients through Hyperledger Caliper and REST API services, PoET could able to perform 946 transactions successfully, whereas PoW completed only 627 transactions. The results obtained in various rounds of evaluation affirm the superiority of the framework.","","978-1-7281-9951-1","10.1109/GUCON50781.2021.9573668","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9573668","Blockchain;Hyperledger Sawtooth;Peer to Peer energy trading;Batch;Transaction;Journal","Supply and demand;Distributed ledger;Smart contracts;Prototypes;Telecommunication traffic;Benchmark testing;Throughput","","","","","","16","","2 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing symbolic analysis tools have demonstrated to be efficient in detecting many of the security vulnerabilities, but by virtue of the complex nature of the analysis they perform to detect vulnerable paths, there is a considerable increase in search time with an increase in depth. Cryptocurrencies have recently achieved the milestone of a USD 2 trillion market cap and with such a high volume of assets involved, the need for an efficient and scalable security vulnerability detection tool in an ever-increasing list of tokens becomes of utmost priority. This paper proposes a deep learning based approach for the prediction of security vulnerabilities in ERC-20 token smart contracts. The proposal proposed by this paper is based on the use of Long Short-Term Memory neural network architecture on smart contract opcodes which are in form of sequential data.

Proof-of-work is the basis of most popular cryptocurrencies and smart contract systems, where participating miners are required to solve difficult mathematical problems to validate transactions. One of the major challenges that proof-of-work faces is the 51% attack, i.e., if an adversary controls more than half of the computation power, he/she can control the blockchain construction and determine which blocks will be included. This is not a major concern when the number of miners is large. However, for an early stage blockchain system with a limited number of users, it is relatively easy for an attacker to launch the 51% attack. To mitigate such risk, we propose a new hybrid blockchain construction scheme that uses the combination of proof-of-work and the stake, which is the number of coins produced by a miner, to determine whether this miner is allowed to construct a block. We prove that stakes play an important role in the hybrid scheme at the beginning, so that an attacker is not able to launch the 51% attack even if he/she controls the majority of the computational power. Meanwhile, the hybrid scheme will converge to pure proof-of-work after sufficiently many blocks are generated, and thus captures the desired properties of proof-of-work. Most importantly, such a convergence is ""smooth"" in the sense that neither changes in the rules nor parameters are introduced, and thus no hard/soft-forks will be triggered. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the new scheme using simulations with different configurations, which can help a designer to select adequate parameters for a specific blockchain application.","2325-6664","978-1-5386-6553-4","10.1109/DSN-W.2018.00050","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8416235","blockchain, proof-of-work, early-stage protection, asymptotic analysis","Bitcoin;Contracts;Computational modeling;Protocols;Switches","cryptography;electronic money","proof-of-work based public blockchain;early stage blockchain system;hybrid blockchain construction scheme;Bitcoin;cryptocurrencies;smart contract systems","","3","","25","","23 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The scheme operates in two phases. In the first phase, based on the area density, and the number of users, UAVs swarms are mounted with thermal imaging sensors that monitor the body temperature of persons. The collected data are sent to ground stations in real-time, through 6G network services. Once, the images are analyzed, the details of potential COVID-19 patients are identified, and their travel and contact records are fetched and stored in BC. Then, in the second phase, the contact-tracing information is validated in BC. The proposed scheme is simulated for smart contracts (SC) functionalities, UAV observations, latency, spectral efficiency, and transaction and signing costs. The obtained results indicate the scheme viability. For example, 6G has a low latency of 330.8 milliseconds (ms), which outperforms 1200.1 ms in fifth-generation (5G) channels. The observed spectral efficiency of 6G channels is 5-10× higher than 5G, and the average signing and transaction cost is 3.473 seconds (s), and 6.873 s respectively, which outperforms the conventional schemes.","","978-1-6654-1450-0","10.1109/ICIEM51511.2021.9445332","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9445332","Blockchain;6G;UAV;Contact Tracing;Data dissemination","6G mobile communication;Temperature sensors;COVID-19;Temperature measurement;Spectral efficiency;5G mobile communication;Surveillance","6G mobile communication;autonomous aerial vehicles;blockchains;contracts;diseases;epidemics;image sensors;infrared imaging;medical image processing;medical robotics;robot vision;surveillance","BloCoV6;blockchain;COVID-19 pandemic;trust-based contact-tracing ecosystem;thermal imaging sensors;6G network services;COVID-19 patients;sixth-generation assisted unmanned aerial vehicle contact tracing;6G-assisted UAV contact tracing;UAV swarms;smart contracts;image analysis;person surveillance","","","","19","","4 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, there are few effective methods and tools for testing DApps and bugs can be easily introduced by inexperienced developers. The existing testing techniques either focus on testing front-end programs or back-end code but ignore the interaction between them, which makes it difficult to apply the techniques directly on DApp. In this paper, we present an automated testing technique for DApps which works in a two-phase manner. First, we employ random events to infer an abstract relation between browser-side events and blockchain-side contracts. Second, our technique generates a set of test cases under the guidance of inferred relations and orders the test cases based on a read-write graph. We also use taint analysis to track data flow of the smart contract and feed it to the generation procedure for following test cases. We have developed a tool called Sungari to implement our approach, and evaluated it on representative real-world DApps. The preliminary evaluation results demonstrated the potential of Sungari in achieving a significant optimization compared to random testing approaches.","2643-7171","978-1-7281-1519-1","10.1109/ICPC.2019.00048","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8813282","Decentralized Application;Blockchain;Smart Contract;Dynamic Testing","","distributed databases;program debugging;program testing;security of data","blockchain-based decentralized applications;DApp;front-end programs;back-end code;automated testing technique;blockchain-side contracts;inferred relations;real-world DApps;random testing approaches;bug testing","","5","","27","","29 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This fog node in turn may offload the task to a neighboring fog node or the cloud-based on an optimal node selection policy. Several such node selection policies have been proposed that facilitate the selection of an optimal node, minimizing delay and energy consumption. However, one crucial assumption of these schemes is that all the networked fog nodes are authorized part of the fog network. This assumption is not valid, especially in a cooperative fog computing environment like a smart city, where fog nodes of multiple applications cooperate to meet their latency and computation requirements. In this paper, we propose a secure task-offloading framework for a distributed fog computing environment based on smart-contracts on the blockchain. The proposed framework allows a fog-node to securely offload tasks to a neighboring fog node, even if no prior trust-relation exists. The security analysis of the proposed framework shows how non-authenticated fog nodes are prevented from taking up offloading tasks.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-8298-8","10.1109/GLOBECOM42002.2020.9322509","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9322509","Cooperative Fog Computing;Fog Security;Task offloading;Blockchain","Peer-to-peer computing;Blockchain;Task analysis;Security;Internet of Things;Cloud computing;Smart contracts","cloud computing;Internet of Things;mobile computing;security of data","secure task-offloading framework;fog computing architecture;computation requirements;offloading tasks;neighboring fog node;optimal node selection policy;networked fog nodes;fog network;distributed fog computing environment;nonauthenticated fog nodes","","","","11","","25 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Blockchain applies the distributed ledger to store transaction histories, and the information is stored across a network of computers instead of on a single server. This facilitates the development of a new set of applications such as distributed file storage systems where users can rent out their storage in return for a premium. The distributed file storage systems provide more privacy and security compared to the centralized storage models as there is no need to have a trusted party. New schemes have been developed for distributed file storage systems on top of the blockchain platform, however, the problem of task/service allocation in these models have not been studied before. In this paper, we study the task/service allocation in the distributed file storage systems considering the challenge of computation cost. First, we formalize the problem of task/service allocation in a decentralized storage network, and then we discuss different approaches to allocate storage tasks to storage servers in an efficient manner.

In particular, the framework enables a simplified user experience through automation, supports modularisation and reuse of complex decision making and machine learning capabilities, and allows for proactive behaviour facilitating autonomy.

Existing gas metering systems mainly focus on measuring the amount of gas flowing through an microelectro mechanical system (MEMS) thermal gas flow sensor and simply ignore the detailed gas composition. From computational fluid mechanics simulations, however, we discover that gases with different compositions will cause different effects on the reading of an MEMS sensor. Based on a thorough analysis of the working principle of MEMS thermal gas flow sensor, we propose an innovative mechanism to compensate the errors caused by different types of natural gases on the sensor's reading. The proposed solution first measures the physical property of metered gas to derive the composition correction coefficient that will then be used to correct the meter's reading errors, considering the relation between the calorific value and physical property of natural gases. In this way, the proposed solution realizes a real-time multicomposition gas metering via thermal gas flow sensors. We implement and evaluate the proposed gas metering technique in various Internet of Things systems, including industrial flow metering, gas metering in smart home, and gas metering in low-power wide-area networks. Experiment results verify the innovative design and confirm that the proposed solution features high sensitivity, high precision, and high range ratio.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2017.2676678","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7867850","Hardware;Internet of Things (IoT);low-power electronics;sensor systems;wireless sensor networks","Natural gas;Gases;Micromechanical devices;Temperature sensors;Heating;Real-time systems","computational fluid dynamics;flow measurement;flow sensors;flowmeters;intelligent sensors;microsensors;natural gas technology","contracted meter readers;natural gas usage data;smart natural gas metering;microelectro mechanical system thermal gas flow sensor;detailed gas composition;computational fluid mechanics simulations;MEMS sensor;composition correction coefficient;real-time multicomposition gas metering;industrial flow metering;Internet of Things systems","","21","","23","IEEE","1 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The computation of exact betweenness centrality is prohibitively expensive for large networks, given a worst-case complexity of O(N<sub>*</sub>E), where N is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges in the network. Accordingly, a multitude of approximation algorithms has been proposed in the literature. Obtaining an overview of the state of the art is difficult, given a combination of numerous algorithms, parameters, and network topologies. In this paper, we report on the results of the probably largest benchmark performed in this field. Specifically, we select 100 networks with distinct topologies and scales, covering various domains. We devise and compare eight selected measures to evaluate the accuracy of the approximation, compared with the exact betweenness computation. All experiments, including those to obtain the exact betweenness values, have been performed on one computer using a single thread, in order to provide a fair comparison. We implemented typical approximation methods and report sensitivity analysis results with a variety of parameters. We find that a uniformly random sampling method, one of the earliest proposed methods in this field, still delivers the best performance, nicely addressing a sweet spot between quality and runtime complexity. In addition, we carried out robustness experiments based on the ranking order of approximated betweenness, in order to show the effect of different approximations on a real-world task. Our study aims at being a reference for choosing a betweenness approximation method, with consideration of network type, the required level of accuracy, and available computational resources.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2927681","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61861136005,61601013,61851110763,71731001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8758412","Complex networks;network topology;approximation algorithms;experimental review;betweenness centrality","Resource management;Contracts;Optimization;Delays;Access control;Smart grids;Machine-to-machine communications","approximation theory;complex networks;computational complexity;graph theory;network theory (graphs);sampling methods;sensitivity analysis;telecommunication network topology","complex networks;worst-case complexity;network topologies;uniformly random sampling method;runtime complexity;betweenness approximation method;betweenness approximation algorithms;betweenness centrality;sensitivity analysis;computational resources","","","","40","CCBY","9 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recently, there is a growing interest to design dynamic SSE schemes with forward security. That is, the server cannot learn the association between the updated data and any query made in the past. However, due to the complexity of update operations, this security property introduces a great challenge of designing verifiable SSE schemes. It is difficult to verify the correctness of updated search results while preserving forward privacy. In this work, we explore how blockchain techniques can help us achieve a verifiable and dynamic SSE construction with forward security. First, we propose a new dynamic SSE scheme based on blockchain techniques, and apply it as the underlying building blocks to preserve forward-secure updates. Second, we resort to the emerging smart contract technique to customize a verification scheme, making updated results easily verifiable. Based on this new primitive, the robustness of the encrypted search service is ensured and forward security is preserved for update operations. Finally, we implement the prototype in Python and Solidity, and conduct performance evaluations on Ethereum.

To do so, a cooperative Stackelberg game is formulated, in which the centralized power system acts as the leader that needs to decide on a price at the peak demand period to incentivize prosumers to not seek any energy from it. The prosumers, on the other hand, act as followers and respond to the leader's decision by forming suitable coalitions with neighboring prosumers in order to participate in P2P energy trading to meet their energy demand. The properties of the proposed Stackelberg game are studied. It is shown that the game has a unique and stable Stackelberg equilibrium, as a result of the stability of prosumers' coalitions. At the equilibrium, the leader chooses its strategy using a derived closed-form expression, while the prosumers choose their equilibrium coalition structure. An algorithm is proposed that enables the centralized power system and the prosumers to reach the equilibrium solution.

We propose a modeling, analysis and design framework for the LSE that accomplishes this goal by solving a hierarchy of two control problems. The first control problem consists of determining an optimal aggregate power trajectory given the price forecasts. The second problem is that of controlling the set-points of the TCL population so as to drive their total power consumption to follow the optimal power trajectory. We show how the LSE can solve these control problems while guaranteeing privacy and contractual comfort bounds for the TCL states.

To accommodate the large volume of data, there is a surge of interest in the design of distributed machine learning, among which stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is one of the mostly adopted methods. Nonetheless, distributed machine learning methods may be vulnerable to Byzantine attack, in which the adversary can deliberately share falsified information to disrupt the intended machine learning procedures. In this work, two asynchronous Byzantine tolerant SGD algorithms are proposed, in which the honest collaborative workers are assumed to store the model parameters derived from their own local data and use them as the ground truth. The proposed algorithms can deal with an arbitrary number of Byzantine attackers and are provably convergent.

Each entity generates and registers its own identifier and credential (public key) to the blockchain such that any entity can obtain the other entity’s public key. When the corresponding private key is compromised, the key rotation to generate and register a new key pair should be performed. However, the current approach for cryptographically binding a decentralized identifier with a public key induces a serious security problem that results in both identity-stealing attacks and multiple identifiers for a single entity. A new decentralized identity to address the security problem above is proposed herein, which is based on a newly proposed cryptographic primitive (infinite one-way hash chain), as well as its security analysis and performance evaluation on Hyperledger Fabric and Contiki Cooja simulator. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed decentralized identity to various security protocols, an authenticated key exchange protocol is also designed.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3121722","National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:NRF-2021R1A2C100327611); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9583584","decentralized identity;blockchain. root-of-trust;infinite one-way hash chain;key rotation;identity-stealing attack;Hyperledger Fabric.","Security;Cryptography;Internet of Things;Blockchains;Smart contracts;Registers;Performance evaluation","","","","","","","IEEE","21 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

One application area of interest for blockchain is securing heterogenous networks. This paper explores the security challenges in a heterogonous network of IoT devices and whether blockchain can be a viable solution.

Our definition is not the only way of understanding Web3.0, yet, it captures the fundamental and defining trait of Web3.0, and meanwhile it is has two desirable properties. Under this definition, we articulate three key infrastructural enablers for Web3.0: individual blockchains, federated or centralized platforms capable of publishing verifiable states, and an interoperability platform to hyperconnect those state publishers. While innovations in all categories are necessary to fully enable Web3.0, in this paper, we present a design for the third enabler, namely HyperService, that delivers interoperability and programmability across heterogeneous blockchains and state publishers. HyperService is powered by two innovative designs: a developer-facing programming framework that allows developers to build cross-chain applications in a unified programming model; and a secure blockchain-facing cryptography protocol that provably realizes those applications on blockchains. We implement a prototype of HyperService in 62,000 lines of code to demonstrate its practicality, usability, and scalability.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2021.3079315","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9428608","","Blockchain;Interoperability;Smart contracts;Protocols;Programming;Technological innovation;Stakeholders","","","","","","","IEEE","11 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Large scale, diversity and high sensitivity on EHR data collected from the personal intelligent medical sensors intrigue strong security and privacy preservation. As an authentication protocol can effectively identify the legality of the access entities, many authentication approaches for SEHR system have been proposed. However, few of them are suitable for such situation where an authentication message need to be generated by two parties, for example, doctors need to gain authenticaion from patients when accessing to EHRs. A limitation of using secret sharing scheme is the requirement of a trusted third party to recover the original private key. Therefore, we focus on the specific case of two participants (i.e., no trusted majority) and present a collaborative authentication protocol for SEHR system. Our protocol is provable secure under the hard problem assumptions and meets all the security requirements, especially private key protection.

Numerical results based on a real-time implementation on a private Ethereum network having smart contract demonstrated that the auction-based mechanism achieves social welfare maximization with privacy protection of online transactions between EVs and the SPs. The results obtained show that the rate of convergence, scalability metric average latency, and standard deviation of the energy transactions have been improved by approximately 18.18%, 15%, and 28.1%, respectively in comparison to the existing schemes.

Recently, various approaches that prevent or mitigate abuse of Tor have been proposed in the literature. This paper, which presents one of the approaches, addresses an IP traceback problem. In our model, onion routers that voluntarily participate in attacker tracing detect attack packets (packets carrying an attacker's code or data) recorded in the log files by sharing necessary information with an attacked server over an Ethereum blockchain network. The detection algorithm in this paper uses the statistics of packet travel and relay times and outputs attack-packet candidates. The proposed method attaches a reliability degree to each candidate, which is based on the upper bounds of its Type I and II error rates. A smart contract running on the blockchain network ranks the detection results from onion routers according to the reliability degrees.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3010756","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9145750","Ethereum;IP traceback;log analysis;network security;Tor","Servers;IP networks;Routing protocols;Contracts;Cryptography;Reliability","computer network reliability;cryptocurrencies;cryptography;distributed databases;IP networks;statistics;telecommunication network routing;Web sites","cyber attackers;criminal activity detection;IP traceback problem;Ethereum blockchain network;network systems;censorship circumvention;log file analysis;website attacker tracing;attack packet detection;the onion router analysis;Tor analysis;attack-packet detection;reliability","","1","","39","CCBY","21 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Consensus mechanisms are a critical component of a Blockchain system's long-term stability. Consensus forms the core of blockchain technology. Therefore, a range of consensus protocols has been introduced to maximize Blockchain systems' efficiency and meet application domains' individual needs. This research paper describes the layered architecture of Blockchain. A comprehensive review of mainstream consensus protocols mainly Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), Proof of Activity (PoA) is presented in the paper. These mainstream consensus protocols have been explained and detailed performance analysis of these consensus protocols has been done. We have proposed a performance matrix of these consensus protocols based on different parameters like Degree of decentralization, Latency, Fault Tolerance Rate, Scalability, etc. Consensus protocols being the core of a strong fault-tolerant secured blockchain system, the proposed work intends to help inappropriate protocol selection and further research on strengthening trust and ownership in the technology.

First of all, the high existence rate of malicious nodes in the chain made it difficult to well purify the network environment, meanwhile the malicious nodes cannot be easily dealt with. Secondly, the correlation between nodes can still be discovered through analysis. As a result, the privacy of users' information cannot be well protected. This paper proposes a distributed identity authentication scheme based on Zero-knowledge proof, which uses face recognition technology to ensure the uniqueness and legitimacy of identity and control the generating of malicious nodes; Zero-knowledge proof algorithm is used to encrypt and support face data to prevent user identity information from being disclosed.

Although the iPhone and Samsung smartphone magnetometer sensors in this study have a nominal sensitivity of ±150 nT, this “digitization”noise level is not a Gaussian process and cannot be further reduced by co-adding more measurements to obtain √N improvements. Moreover, there are a variety of systematic effects including apparently uncontrollable glitches and “dc”baseline changes that have amplitudes of ±2000 nT during long-term measurement operations. These systematic variations appear to mask the detection of all but the strongest geomagnetic storms with K > 8. It is possible that other existing smartphones outside this study have improved magnetic sensors, and that future improvements in sensor design may change these conclusions, so a continued study of this issue is warranted.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2863949","NASA Space Science Education Consortium through ADNET contract SESDA-IV(grant numbers:80GSFC17C0003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8425973","Smart devices;wireless sensor networks;event detection;knowledge engineering;crowd-sourcing;data analysis;physics education;student experiments;geophysics;geomagnetism;magnetic field measurements;Magnetometers","Magnetometers;Magnetic field measurement;Magnetic sensors;Magnetosphere;Storms;Observatories","magnetic field measurement;magnetic sensors;magnetic storms;magnetometers;smart phones","geomagnetic storm detection;Samsung smartphone magnetometer sensors;iPhone smartphone magnetometer sensors;magnetic storm event measurement;magnetic storm event detection;magnetic sensor design;long-term measurement operations;Gaussian process;smartphone technology","","2","","23","USGov","6 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The initial period of time has multiple sources of conflicting information coming in and creating confusion about the situation. The most important immediate requirement is to create a traversal map, highlighting navigable paths to victims of the disaster and possible hazardous locations. Due to infrastructure damage, it is hard for existing centralized geospatial portals to quickly update and provide this information, which has become outdated. IoT solutions that can be deployed without extensive preparation provide the capability to quickly acquire and disseminate essential information to rescue teams. In this paper, we present a decentralized system, named DEIMOSBC, that is able to provide such a mapping service faster and more reliably, utilizing the work of volunteers and relying on a blockchain backend that is based on an IoT system. Our solution utilizes the availability of modern smartphones with GPS receivers and processing capabilities to collect sequences of GPS locations and chain them into trajectories. These trajectory data are submitted as entries into a blockchain after cleaning them through a purpose-built smart contract. DEIMOSBC relies on the inherent robustness and distributed nature of a blockchain to make collating and assembling a map from these paths more accurate and less susceptible to disruption. We describe how DEIMOSBC would work for a hypothetical disaster scenario of a Category 5 hurricane striking an area of the Gulf of Mexico.","","978-1-6654-3924-4","10.1109/BRAINS52497.2021.9569794","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9569794","Blockchain;crowdsourcing;Internet of Things;disaster management;map building","Smart contracts;Receivers;Robustness;Hurricanes;Blockchains;Trajectory;Geospatial analysis","","","","","","9","","25 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, they are regulated and tracked across the healthcare sector to protect the health of the general public which is a highly prioritized rule in the health professional’s code of ethics. Healthcare centers that provide controlled medication to patients are still using manual papers to record controlled drugs production, delivery, prescription, administration, and disposal which causes delays in the system. Moreover, instances of controlled drugs misuse, abuse, and diversion still exist, which shows how the currently used system is inefficient in detecting such activities. Therefore, to ensure that the public health is safe and secure, an end-to-end system that tracks the whole healthcare supply chain is necessary. In this paper, we introduce a private Ethereum blockchain-based solution for the management of controlled medication.

In this paper, we propose energy-aware dynamic node management technology for online MapReduce jobs by powering on/off nodes in Hadoop cluster to reduce energy consumption while meet user's Service Level Agreements (SLA). Under the dynamic node management policy, the time-varying workload is predicted by extracting the MapReduce job history information continuously. And then, the energy-aware dynamic node management with deadline-driven is used to keep the proper number of nodes for MapReduce tasks based on the average execution time of containers and predictive workloads. Finally, the nodes which have been kept in idle state for threshold duration are turned off to reduce energy costs. We perform extensive simulations on a Yarn Scheduler Load Simulator (SLS) to exploit the energy consumption, the violations on SLA and execution time for each big data application in a period of time. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed policy to achieve energy savings over comparable four policies with respect to meeting SLA.","","978-1-5090-4297-5","10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS.2016.0059","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7828400","big data;MapReduce;Energy efficency;dynamic management;resource provision","Containers;Big data applications;Energy consumption;Dynamic scheduling;Yarn;Predictive models;Heuristic algorithms","Big Data;cloud computing;computer centres;contracts;parallel processing;power aware computing;resource allocation;scheduling;statistical analysis","energy-aware dynamic resource allocation;energy-aware dynamic node management;Hadoop YARN cluster;Big Data;cloud data center;MapReduce job;service level agreement;SLA;time-varying workload prediction;YARN scheduler load simulator;SLS","","7","","17","","26 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Additionally, the existence of a central entity, such as news agencies, could lead to fraud in the news broadcasting process, e.g. generating fake news and publishing them for their benefits. Since Blockchain technology provides a reliable decentralized network, it can be used to publish news. In addition, Blockchain with the help of decentralized applications and smart contracts can provide a platform in which fake news can be detected through public participation.

This paper identifies and classifies real-life blockchain transactions embedding metadata of a number of major protocols running essentially over the bitcoin blockchain. The empirical analysis here presents the evolution of metadata utilization in the recent years, and the discussion suggests steps towards preventing criminal use.

GenMinimax is characterized by three rate zones with the narrowest in the middle, called threshold band, constituting the attraction zone where the lowest rate is charged. The scheme is designed so that the threshold band envelops a negotiated reference consumption profile. We consider a cooperative group of customers pooling together their flexible loads and participating in the energy market via an aggregator. The aggregator computes an optimal daily profile taking into account the gross daily demand from the consumer group and the energy market's expected conditions and opportunities, and assigns prices and rate zones accordingly. The consumer group reacts by deferring and curtailing the flexible loads in order to minimize their daily cost consisting of the energy bill, the utility cost, and the curtailment reward. We model the consumers' response and interaction with the aggregator as a two-stage sequential optimization problem. We perform sensitivity analysis over the most significant parameter combinations through two scenarios and five cases. We compare the performance of our scheme to that of time-of-use (TOU) and real time pricing (RTP). Using a 40-home aggregate energy profile, we show that consumers can match a test supply profile with 5% maximum error and 2% average error while TOU and RTP can lead, respectively, to 163% and 97% maximum error, and 37% and 25% average error.","1949-3061","","10.1109/TSG.2016.2602870","DARPA; NSF; DOE; PITA; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7552513","Retail electricity pricing;demand response;stochastic generation","Pricing;Load modeling;Uncertainty;Optimization;Aggregates;Electronic mail;Contracts","demand side management;minimax techniques;power markets;pricing;retailing;sensitivity analysis","test supply profile;generalized minimax;self-enforcing pricing scheme;GenMinimax;rate zones;attraction zone;lowest rate;negotiated reference consumption profile;flexible loads;energy market;aggregator;optimal daily profile;daily cost;utility cost;curtailment reward;two-stage sequential optimization problem;time pricing;consumer group;electricity retail pricing scheme;threshold band;gross daily demand;home aggregate energy profile","","6","","44","IEEE","25 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper takes the intelligent transportation sensor network as an example and proposes a blockchain-based Internet of Vehicles (IoV) data secure sharing scheme (called IoVChain), which implements automatic registration, rapid authentication, and reliable sharing method of IoV data through smart contract. The smart contract performs homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proof processing on the sensitive part of the data, and this part exists in the form of ciphertext on the blockchain. We adopt PBFT consensus mechanism to ensure the consistency of the entire network ledger, and all the IoV data processing and usage procedure is stored in the Merkle-tree-based block, which cannot be tampered with. Compared with the centralized IoV data management solution, the IoVChain scheme avoids the risk of single point of failure, and keeps the IoV data credible, available, and tamper-resistant under the premise of privacy and security, so that the data can be traced when needed. We have implemented the IoVChain scheme based on the consortium blockchain for trusted and secure sharing of IoV data.

Despite the prospect of ad dissemination in vehicular networks, it faces challenges upon deployment especially on security and privacy. Particularly, vehicles may collude to defraud the advertiser to obtain rewards without disseminating ads, which may cause unfair “free-riding” issue in these activities. Furthermore, concerns on possible privacy leakage may discourage vehicles to participate in the process of ad dissemination. In addition, external DDoS attacks and internal single point of failure may also affect service availability. To address these issues, we explore the potential of blockchain technology to construct a fair and anonymous scheme for advertising in vehicular networks. We first present the overview of the blockchain-based ad dissemination framework. Then, under the framework, we design a concrete, fair and anonymous scheme. To ensure fairness, we utilize the Merkle hash tree together with smart contracts to achieve the “proof-of-ad-receiving” property (i.e., check whether a vehicle indeed receives an ad without deception or introducing significant storage cost) to mitigate the “free-riding” attack. On the other hand, any ad receiver who acquires a dissemination reward per ad more than once can be effectively detected and will be punished which is achieved by using smart contracts. Additionally, the proposed scheme can protect vehicles' privacy in terms of anonymity and conditional linkability based on zero-knowledge proof techniques. Lastly, extensive security analysis and implementations demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the scheme.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2019.2940148","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11871248,61872153,61972178); Jinan University; National Key Research and Development Plan of China(grant numbers:2017YFB0802203,2018YFB1003701); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1736203,61825203,61732021); Guangdong Provincial Special Funds for Applied Technology Research and Development and Transformation of Important Scientific and Technological Achieve(grant numbers:2016B010124009,2017B010124002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8827301","Ad dissemination;blockchain;privacy preser-vation;fairness;vehicular networks","Blockchain;Privacy;Smart contracts;Receivers;Computer crime;Advertising","cryptography;data privacy;distributed databases;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security;trees (mathematics);vehicular ad hoc networks","proof-of-ad-receiving property;anonymous ad dissemination;vehicular networks;advertisement dissemination;disseminating ads;privacy leakage;DDoS attacks;blockchain technology;blockchain-based ad dissemination framework;vehicle-to-vehicle communications;vehicle-to-infrastructure communications","","17","","37","IEEE","9 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a result, Edge Computing (EC) has emerged to address these issues, by placing part of the cloud resources (e.g., computation, storage, logic) closer to the edge of the network, which allows faster and context dependent data analysis and storage. However, as EC infrastructures grow, different providers who do not necessarily trust each other need to collaborate in order serve different IoT devices. In this context, EC infrastructures, IoT devices and the data transiting the network all need to be subject to identity and provenance checks, in order to increase trust and accountability. Each device/data in the network needs to be identified and the provenance of its actions needs to be tracked. In this paper, we propose a blockchain container based architecture that implements the W3C-PROV Data Model, to track identities and provenance of all orchestration decisions of a business network. This architecture provides new forms of interaction between the different stakeholders, which supports trustworthy transactions and leads to a new decentralized interaction model for IoT based applications.","","978-1-5386-9585-2","10.1109/IoTSMS.2018.8554470","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8554470","blockchain;edge computing;containers;provenance;smart contracts","Containers;Edge computing;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Peer-to-peer computing","cloud computing;data analysis;Internet of Things;open systems;trusted computing","business network;trustworthy transactions;IoT based applications;decentralized interaction model;stakeholders;W3C-PROV data model;verity;IoT devices;Internet of Things devices;blockchain container based architecture;accountability;EC infrastructures;context dependent data analysis;cloud resources;velocity;volume;permissioned blockchain;container based edge computing;trustworthy orchestration","","4","","20","","2 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it remains a challenging task to design effective incentives that encourage secure and collaborative data sharing in multiple clouds. In this paper, we propose a reliable collaboration model consisting of three types of participants, which include data owners, miners, and third parties, where the data is shared via blockchain and recorded by a smart contract. In general, these participants may acquire and store the sharing of data using their private or public clouds.

A novel efficient resource management policy for virtualized data centers which optimizes the number of resources to meet requirements of dynamic workloads without migration is proposed in this paper. The proposed approach contains an experiment based prediction module. Energy-performance trade off relies on comparison of the predicted and the active number of servers periodically.

EBAS proactively scales resources at the CPU core level in terms of both the number and frequency of cores. It incorporates the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) technique to dynamically adjust CPU frequencies. The proactive decisions on resource scaling are enabled primarily by the CPU usage prediction model and the workload consolidation model of EBAS. The experimental results show that EBAS can save energy on average by 14% compared with the Linux governor. In particular, EBAS contributes to enhancing DVFS by making it aware of SLA conditions, which leads to savings of computing power and in turn energy.","","978-1-5090-4297-5","10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS.2016.0123","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7828464","Auto-Scaling;Energy Efficiency;Cloud Data Centers;Docker Containers;Resource Provisioning","Predictive models;Computational modeling;Energy consumption;Forecasting;Power demand;Time-frequency analysis;Prediction algorithms","cloud computing;computer centres;contracts;energy conservation;Linux;power aware computing;resource allocation","SLA-aware resource scaling;energy efficiency;cloud data centers;CDC;resource provisioning;energy efficiency;energy-based auto scaling;EBAS;resource auto-scaling;service level agreement;CPU core level;dynamic voltage and frequency scaling;DVFS;CPU frequencies;CPU usage prediction model;workload consolidation model;Linux governor;SLA conditions","","","","23","","26 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fog Computing is proposed to be an extension of cloud computing architecture where the resources are brought near the end users. Fog computing, in contrast to cloud computing provides services along with the computing resources. To borrow the services, the enterprises have to pay according to their usage of the services or resources. In this paper, two nature inspired algorithms are compared to determine the efficient management of resources so that the cost of resources can be minimized and the billing can be achieved through calculation of the utilized resources. Pigeon Inspired Optimization (PIO) and Enhanced Differential Evolution (EDE) are used to determine the energy consumed by the cloudlets or edge nodes that in turn can be used for estimating the bill through the Time of Use pricing variable. We evaluate both of the aforementioned technique to determine their performance regarding the bill calculation on the basis of usage of fog servers. Simulation results demonstrate that PIO gives significantly better results than EDE in terms of resource utilization whereas for bill reduction EDE outperforms PIO based technique.","","978-1-5386-8000-1","10.1109/SmartCloud.2018.00022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8513720","Cloud computing, Fog computing, Bio-inspired Algorithms, Utility, Pricing","Cloud computing;Edge computing;Optimization;Pricing;Estimation;Task analysis;Computer architecture","cloud computing;contracts;evolutionary computation;optimisation;pricing;resource allocation","fog computing;computing resources;nature inspired algorithms;fog servers;resource utilization;utility price estimation;large-scale enterprises;Internet service providers;cloud computing architecture;resources utilization;bio-inspired optimization techniques;information and communication technologies;service level agreements;resource sharing;pigeon inspired optimization;enhanced differential evolution;cloudlets;time of use pricing","","","","21","","28 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, none of existing solutions consider the underlying incentive issues behind a rational server who is motivated to collect users' data but tries to evade the replication checking in order to save storage resources. In this article, we propose the first decentralized system for proofs of data retrievability and replication-BOSSA, which is incentive-compatible for each party and realizes automated auditing atop off-the-shelf blockchain platforms.

Fortunately, the blockchain revolution facilitates innovative solutions. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based fair nonrepudiation service provisioning scheme for IIoT scenarios in which the blockchain is used as a service publisher and an evidence recorder. Each service is separately delivered via on-chain and off-chain channels with mandatory evidence submissions for nonrepudiation purpose. Moreover, a homomorphic-hash-based service verification method is designed that can function with mere on-chain evidence. And an impartial smart contract is implemented to resolve disputes.

Yet, effective sharing and collaboration are rare. A gamut of legislative acts, executive orders, academic works, and private sector initiatives have discussed aspects of the problem and aimed to be the catalyst needed to fix the situation. But almost 30 years since these efforts started, the state of sharing and collaboration is still technically complicated, slow, untrusted, and impeded by bureaucratic woes. This work identifies the challenges of sharing security artifacts and uses real-world examples to illustrate our findings. Based on this knowledge, we propose a new model for sharing and collaboration, CARE. The CARE architecture eases many of the privacy, secrecy, lineage, and structure issues that plague current sharing communities and platforms. We then build upon this foundation to introduce a marketplace based on smart contracts with transactional privacy over a distributed blockchain. Therefore, CARE incentivizes sharing, combats free riding, and provides an immutable ledger for the attribution of events. This paradigm shift, overcomes the challenges of sharing while providing new opportunities for business models, insurance risk assessments, and government backed incentivisation.","","978-1-5386-7975-3","10.1109/Cybermatics_2018.2018.00240","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8726690","Threat Intelligence;Information Sharing;Malware;Computer Security","Collaboration;Computer security;Privacy;Tools;Business;Computational modeling","data privacy;legislation;risk management","CARE architecture;collaborative analysis;security analytics;security practitioners;legislative acts;executive orders;security information;security artifacts;distributed blockchain;time 30.0 year","","1","1","57","","3 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For example, several recent news items show that a considerable number of registered drivers whose licenses have been revoked are still taking RHS orders on the respective platforms; this phenomenon directly leads to insecurity on part of its users and the bad reputation of the ride-hailing service provider(SP). The traditional solution to solve this problem is to periodically check the validity of the drivers' licenses; however, it is a considerably time-consuming and costly process since the SPs have to manually interact with the governing authorities. Therefore, in this paper, we have presented an auditable self-sovereign identity system (named AudiSSI), which provides an efficient approach for the SPs to manage their registered drivers' qualifications in a decentralized and automatic manner. Further, we propose a safety guarantee insurance to enable the RHS rider to check their driver's qualifications before the trip starts. We designed an incentive mechanism and have provided a game-theoretical analysis.

MCS has been widely adopted in smart cities, personal health care, and environment monitor areas. MCS applications recruit participants to obtain sensory data from the target area by allocating reward to them. Reward mechanisms are crucial in stimulating participants to join and provide sensory data. However, while the MCS applications execute the reward mechanisms, sensory data and personal private information can be in great danger because of malicious task initiators/participants and hackers. This article proposes a novel blockchain-based MCS framework that preserves privacy and secures both the sensing process and the incentive mechanism by leveraging the emergent blockchain technology. Moreover, to provide a fair incentive mechanism, this article has considered an MCS scenario as a sensory data market, where the market separates the participants into two categories: monthly-pay participants and instant-pay participants. By analyzing two different kinds of participants and the task initiator, this article proposes an incentive mechanism aided by a three-stage Stackelberg game. Through theoretical analysis and simulation, the evaluation addresses two aspects: the reward mechanism and the performance of the blockchain-based MCS. The proposed reward mechanism achieves up to a 10% improvement of the task initiator's utility compared with a traditional Stackelberg game. It can also maintain the required market share for monthly-pay participants while achieving sustainable sensory data provision. The evaluation of the blockchain-based MCS shows that the latency increases in a tolerable manner as the number of participants grows. Finally, this article discusses the future challenges of blockchain-based MCS.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2019.2956629","H2020 LEIT Information and Communication Technologies(grant numbers:780139); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8956044","Blockchain;mobile crowdsensing (MCS);reward mechanism;sensory data market;Stackelberg game","Sensors;Blockchain;Task analysis;Security;Resource management;Smart contracts;Privacy","cryptography;cyber-physical systems;data privacy;distributed databases;game theory;mobile computing","three-stage Stackelberg game;blockchain-based MCS framework;cyber-physical-social systems;mobile crowdsensing;blockchain-based reward mechanism;sustainable sensory data provision;instant-pay participants;monthly-pay participants;sensory data market;fair incentive mechanism","","5","","44","IEEE","10 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This objective would be accomplished by establishing an IoT infrastructure for the collection of the huge amount of available shop floor data, which can be analyzed, considering data analytics algorithms, predictive maintenance models and forecasting techniques, to perform the machine/system health assessment and prediction of maintenance needs, e.g. by detecting earlier the occurrence of possible failures and consequently the need to implement maintenance interventions. The scheduling of predictive maintenance needs will be integrated with the existing maintenance planning tools, and especially synchronized with the production planning tools to achieve a nondisruptive maintenance impact in the production system.

IoT devices are characterized by relatively low computing capabilities and low power consumption, as well as sporadic and low-bandwidth wireless connectivity. An IoT device connects to one or more validator nodes to observe or modify the state of the accounts. In order to interact with the most recent state of accounts, a device needs to be synchronized with the blockchain copy stored by the validator nodes.

These enable the application of radially folding structures in domains including fluidics, medical stents, and auxetic materials. A compact form of elastic deployment utilizing linkage strain energy is proposed using beam theory analysis. Elastic strain energy is also shown to produce bistable folding behavior, with two low energy states at full contraction and full expansion, and a bistable switching point at some intermediate position. Polymeric smart materials are investigated for driving active folding. These materials can be readily exploited through the features of the folding structure including its ability to resolve 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D actuation strains into a more effective single degree-of-freedom linear, areal, volumetric or rotational output. The elastic and solid-state nature of many polymeric smart materials means they can implement elastic deployment and bistability. A thermally-activated shape memory polymer is shown to fold a 4-segment structure from expanded to contracted states. Experimental testing of an 8-segment dielectric elastomer actuator prototype demonstrates that radially folding structures can resolve large biaxial planar strains generated by dielectric elastomers into a single linear or rotational output stroke.","1941-014X","","10.1109/TMECH.2011.2153867","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5783933","Bistable mechanism;dielectric elastomer actuator;shape memory polymer;smart structure","Polymers;Couplings;Actuators;Intelligent structures","","","","15","1","17","IEEE","6 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Knowing the rental behavior pattern and forecasting the demand become more important for rental businesses. To this end, in this paper, we aim to analyze the rental mobility pattern by examining multiple factors in a holistic manner. A special goal is to predict the demand of a given region. Specifically, we first analyze regular mobility based on real trips of rental cars. Then, we extract key features from multiple types of rental-related data, such as rental behavior profiles and geo-social information of regions. Next, based on these features, we develop a multi-task learning based regression approach for predicting rental cars' demand. This approach can effectively learn not only fundamental features but also relationships between regions by considering multiple factors. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world rental trip data collected in Beijing. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for forecasting rental demand in the real world.","","978-1-5386-0435-9","10.1109/UIC-ATC.2017.8397484","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8397484","","Automobiles;Feature extraction;Companies;Data mining;Urban areas;Contracts","intelligent transportation systems;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;public transport;regression analysis;rental","temporal travel patterns;spatial travel patterns;car rental demand forecasting;geosocial information;multitask learning based regression approach;rental behavior profiles;rental-related data;rental cars;holistic manner;rental mobility pattern;rental businesses;rental behavior pattern;rental car industry;shared mobility services","","","","31","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, utilizing the advantages of blockchain, distributed personal data markets have recently been considered because all participants behave selfishly for their profits in the markets. Since the participants may behave maliciously, it is necessary to prevent such behavior, and one of the considered approaches is putting additional deposits as a penalty into blockchain smart contracts. Since data brokers give various advantages to maintain personal data trading markets, many studies have considered both data brokers and blockchain at the same time. However, those studies have mainly focused on putting deposits into data buyers/sellers but not data brokers. However, since data brokers are also major players in the market, it is necessary to consider deposit decision models for data brokers. Hence, this paper proposes a deposit decision model for data brokers in distributed personal data markets using blockchain. Particularly, this paper proposes a profit model with deposits depending on their behavior for handling contracts and a credit level model that puts fewer deposits for a data broker with a higher credit level to motivate the data brokers’ truthful behavior. With the analysis of the proposed models, this paper shows that the models are feasible to motivate data brokers’ truthful behavior by allocating deposits for not only a large enough penalty but also a fair enough incentive.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3104870","Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP) Grant through Korean Government [Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT)] (Development of 5G-IoT Trustworthy AI-Data Commons Framework, 50%)(grant numbers:2020-0-00048); Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI) Grant through Korean Government (Core Technology Research on Trust Data Connectome, 50%)(grant numbers:21ZR1330); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9514497","Personal data market;data broker;blockchain;deposit","Data models;Blockchains;Biological system modeling;Analytical models;Solid modeling;Smart contracts;Pricing","","","","","","30","CCBY","16 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As the change of consensus mechanism is an extremely delicate matter, this improvement will be achieved through different phases, the first of which is the implementation of the Beacon Chain. For this, a specification has been developed, and multiple groups have implemented clients to run the new protocol.

Aggregators, which act as mediators between end-users and distribution system operator (DSO), play an important role here. The aggregator contracts the end-users for DR programs, plans ahead for times when customers should shift their load, and controls the load shifts in the running time. In this paper, our main focus is on planning the end-users for load shifting. Here, we first define and formulate the flexibilities (e.g., Stamina, repetition, and capacity) related to the dynamic loads such as space heating systems (SHSs) in detached houses. Assuming some end-users being contracted for DR program, based on estimation of their house characteristics and load flexibilities, an algorithm is then proposed to plan the SHSs for load shifting. In this algorithm the states in which a flexible load can be planned, kept in backup, or unavailable are considered by the aggregator. Another algorithm has been proposed here to deal with the different sources of uncertainties (which cause some of the planned SHSs to become unavailable). Numerical results are presented at the end, which discuss performance of the proposed strategy in terms of load flexibilities, load shifts in response to DR signals, and sensitivity analysis. Here, how to estimate the houses characteristics is a difficult issue, and we approximate them based on available models in the literature.","","978-1-5386-0943-9","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2017.8340694","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8340694","","Planning;Load modeling;Space heating;Tin;Uncertainty;Heuristic algorithms","demand side management;power distribution planning;sensitivity analysis;space heating","load shifts;aggregator;DR program;load shifting;dynamic loads;flexible load;demand response programs;end-users;sensitivity analysis;DR signals;detached houses;SHS;space heating systems;DSO;distribution system operator;load flexibility modeling;demand response resources planning;load reductions","","2","","13","","19 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, a serious problem is data integrity in the sense that data owners lose their physical control over the remote-stored data. Existing provable data possession protocols are overwhelmingly designed for centralized storage such as cloud, in which the server is assumed dishonest but the client is reliable. Moreover, the centralized storage suffers single-point-of-failure threat. In this paper, to deal with these issues, we propose the notion of IntegrityChain, a decentralized storage framework supporting provable data possession (PDP) based on blockchain. We formalize the system model, in which a data owner can store files to the peers in a blockchain network and check the integrity of the outsourced data periodically by paying some cryptocurrencies while the hosts can earn money if honestly provide storage service and will be punished by losing the pre-made deposit if data loss happens. In the security model, we consider the fairness in trading between a host and a data user and the soundness of the underlying decentralized PDP in this system. We come up with a concrete construction by borrowing the idea of multi-replica PDP and proof-of-retrievability and present the security analysis of the proposal. The evaluation for the construction contain two segments: the offchain part, in which we implement the algorithms locally to test the time consumption, and onchain part, in which we program a smart contract and launch it in a test network to test the gas cost for the functions.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2020.2986664","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2017YFB0802000); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872229,61671377,U19B2021); Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi(grant numbers:2020ZDLGY09-06); Basic Research Program of Qinghai Province (2020-ZJ-701); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9060815","Outsourced storage;data integrity;blockchain;smart contract;cryptocurrency","Protocols;Servers;Cloud computing;Cryptography;Data integrity","cryptography;data integrity;distributed databases;outsourcing;storage management","IntegrityChain;outsourced storage;data owner;remote storage resources;data integrity;remote-stored data;provable data possession protocols;centralized storage;decentralized storage framework;outsourced data;storage service;data loss;data user;blockchain;PDP;security analysis","","1","","38","IEEE","8 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Aggregators are meant to contribute to the increase of the share of demand side flexibility provided by relatively small residential and commercial resources. In particular, distribution system operators may benefit from the activation of such flexibility in order to alleviate congestions in load areas operated by them. A specific flexibility product is studied in this paper in which the capacity for a specified generation/demand modification is previously procured for a specific period of time but the activation is optionally triggered by a control signal from the flexibility buyer at short notice. When delivering flexibility, aggregators need to have tools to correct bad performance of flexibility resources due to technical issues arising in real-time domain in order to remain qualified players for flexibility trading. In this paper, an algorithm to allocate flexibility volumes among available resources connected to the same load area is developed. The algorithm corrects possible failures to deliver by means of the verification of energy measurements from the aggregator's resources portfolio.

However, the problem with the SIP protocol is that it was not designed to be secure by nature as the HTTP digest authentication used in SIP is insecure, making it vulnerable to a variety of attacks. The current solutions rely on several standardised encryption protocols, such as TLS and IPsec, to protect SIP registration messages. However, the current centralised solutions do not scale well and cause algorithm overload when encoding and decoding SIP messages. In trying to rectify this issue, we propose in this paper a blockchain-based lightweight authentication mechanism, which involves a decentralised identity model to authenticate the SIP client to the SIP server. Our mechanism uses a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain to ensure trust, accountability and preserves user privacy. We provided a proof-of-concept implementation to demonstrate our work. Further analysis of this approach's usability, mainly CPU and memory usage, was conducted comparing to IPsec and TLS. Then we discussed our system's security and presented a security analysis. Our analysis proves that our approach satisfies the SIP protocol security requirements.","2768-0029","978-1-6654-0722-9","10.1109/CSNet52717.2021.9614646","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9614646","Voice over IP (VoIP);SIP protocol;Blockchain technology","Privacy;Smart contracts;Authentication;Encoding;Blockchains;Encryption;Security","","","","","","25","","23 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By combining the MA-CPABE and proxy re-encryption, the rights owner can flexibly sell the copyright to different users with once encryption by an agent who cannot access any information related to digital content when changing the ciphertext access policy as required. By using the smart contract of Ethereum, a fair trade of the decryption keys between the rights owner and rights requester is implemented. In order to further improve fairness, another blockchain is used as a ledge to store information related to digital rights, which greatly reduces the storage overhead in public blockchain. Security analysis shows that our scheme can provide IND-CPA security, resist collusion attacks, and protect the user’s privacy.

This rapid growth has fueled incredible transformations over the past decade. Nowadays, there exist insurance products for most high-value assets such as vehicles, jewellery, health/life, and homes. Insurance companies are at the forefront in adopting cutting-edge operations, processes, and mathematical models to maximize profit whilst servicing their customers claims. Traditional methods that are exclusively based on human-in-the-loop models are very time-consuming and inaccurate. In this paper, we develop a secure and automated insurance system framework that reduces human interaction, secures the insurance activities, alerts and informs about risky customers, detects fraudulent claims, and reduces monetary loss for the insurance sector. After presenting the blockchain-based framework to enable secure transactions and data sharing among different interacting agents within the insurance network, we propose to employ the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine learning algorithm for the aforementioned insurance services and compare its performances with those of other state-of-the-art algorithms. The obtained results reveal that, when applied to an auto insurance dataset, the XGboost achieves high performance gains compared to other existing learning algorithms. For instance, it reaches 7% higher accuracy compared to decision tree models when detecting fraudulent claims.

The main advantage of using only the data center signals of modern vehicles is economical. The classification of the driving behavior and the warning to the driver of dangerous behaviors without the need to add extra hardware (and their software) to the vehicle, would allow the direct integration of these classifiers into the current vehicles without incurring a greater cost in the manufacture of the vehicles and therefore be an added value.

In specific, mobile users are incentivized to collect and share private data values (e.g., current locations) to fulfill a commonly interested task released by a customer, and the crowdsensing server computes aggregate statistics over the values of mobile users (e.g., the most popular location) for the customer. By utilizing the ElGamal encryption, the server learns nearly nothing about the private data or the statistical result. The correctness of aggregate statistics can be publicly verified by using a new efficient and verifiable computation approach. Moreover, the fairness of incentive is guaranteed based on the public blockchain in the presence of greedy service provider, customers, and mobile users, who may launch payment-escaping, payment-reduction, free-riding, double-reporting, and Sybil attacks to corrupt reward distribution.

For example, blockchain-based process execution allows, at least conceptually, for cross-organizational compatibility, data integration, and integrity assurance without the need for a centralized trusted operator. However, most business processes run in agile and rapidly changing business environments. Updating a decentralized process requires continuous and extensive consensus-building efforts. Reflecting all organizations' business requirements is hardly practicable. Hence, in many real-life scenarios, to support cases with initially unforeseen properties, organizations can allow to bypass the decentralized process and fall-back to local variants. Yet, the decision to bypass or update a given process can have significant social implications since it may encourage a social dynamic that encourages collective avoidance of the decentralized process. This paper proposes a multi-agent simulation system to assess the social consequences of approving a bypass under given conditions. The proposed simulation is intended to inform the decision-maker (human or machine) on whether to allow to bypass a process or not. Moreover, we present an architecture for the integration of multi-agent simulation system, local process engine, and decentralized process execution environment, and describe a possible implementation with a particular tool chain.","","978-1-5386-7325-6","10.1109/WI.2018.000-6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8609677","multi-agent systems, business process management, socio-technical systems","Organizations;Computer architecture;Task analysis;Standards organizations;Smart contracts;Multi-agent systems","business data processing;cryptography;data integration;data integrity;decision making;distributed databases;multi-agent systems;organisational aspects","business processes;bypassing decentralized processes;data integration;integrity assurance;cross-organizational compatibility;multiagent simulation system;business environments;blockchain-based process execution;decentralized process execution environment;local process engine","","","","38","","13 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to its decentralized nature, no one can monitor workers' behavior, and they may thus deviate protocols (e.g., participating without updating any models). To solve this problem, many researchers have proposed blockchain-enabled FL to reward workers (or users) with cryptocurrencies to encourage workers to follow the protocols. However, there is a lack of theoretical discussions concerning how such rewards impact workers' behavior and how much should be given to workers. In this article, we propose a mechanism-design-oriented FL protocol on a public blockchain network. Mechanism design (MD) is often used to make a rule intended to achieve a specific goal. With MD in mind, we introduce the concept of competition into blockchain-based FL so that only workers who have contributed well can obtain rewards, which naturally prevents workers from deviating from the protocol. We then mathematically answer the following questions with contest theory, a novel field of study in economics: i) What behavior will workers take?; ii) how much effort should workers exert to maximize their profits?; iii) how many workers should be rewarded?; and iv) what is the best proportion for reward distribution?","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3043037","A*STAR’s through the Project P20-O1-068USV Blockchain-based Federated Learning Platform with Mechanism Design(grant numbers:SC26/19-331190); KAKENHI from MEXT/JSPS, Japan(grant numbers:18K18162); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9285269","Federated learning;decentralized deep learning;blockchain;mechanism design;contest theory","Blockchain;Biological system modeling;Data models;Cryptography;Smart contracts;Task analysis;Protocols","cryptocurrencies;distributed databases;learning (artificial intelligence);personnel","blockchain-enabled FL;mechanism-design-oriented FL protocol;public blockchain network;blockchain-based FL;blockchain-enabled federated learning;decentralized deep learning technique;cryptocurrencies","","1","","36","CCBY","7 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, there is one missing aspect of the deepfake problem, which is `authentication'. Instead of attempting to detect what content is fake, in this paper, we focus on techniques to provide tamper-proof evidence of what content is real. Blockchain has been advocated to be helpful with the authentication aspect of many real-world scenarios. Despite the scattered efforts around such solutions, there are no studies that can shed light on where it makes sense to adopt blockchain technology to better take on the deepfake problem.

In this paper, Crowd Sensing (CS) is used to collect sensed data with a large number of mobile devices equipped with sensors to ensure reliability and sensing range. In order to solve single point of failure caused by the vulnerability of the cluster in CS, we used the characteristics of blockchain (i.e. de-centralization and de-trust) to ensure the security and correctness of the spectrum trading process. Specifically, a Blockchain Based Spectrum Sensing (BBSS) system is proposed, in which requester recruit sensing workers to involve in spectrum sensing, sensing workers obtain benefits by participating in spectrum sensing and miner verifies and packages transactions into the blockchain. In particular, the recruitment and sensing worker's response is modeled as a Reward-Sensing-time game, and the strategy of requester is the total reward R, and the strategy of sensing worker is the sensing time t. We proved that both of them can adopt strategies to maximize their own benefits. Simulation results show that requester benefit increases with the growing number of sensing workers, but the amplification is smaller and smaller. A certain sensing worker who adopted strategy can achieve larger benefit compared with random allocation of sensing time when the number of sensing workers is smaller (less than 500) in the system.","2693-2865","978-1-7281-5244-8","10.1109/ITAIC49862.2020.9338914","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9338914","crowd sensing;dynamic spectrum access;specrtum sensing;blockchain","Smart contracts;Blockchain;Games;Sensors;Security;Reliability;Task analysis","blockchains;cognitive radio;game theory;radio spectrum management;signal detection;telecommunication network reliability","blockchain;Spectrum Sensing system;sensing worker;Reward-Sensing-time game;sensing time t;Dynamic Spectrum Access;existing sensing technology;sensing nodes;narrow sensing range;Crowd Sensing;sensed data;reliability","","","","20","","3 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is attributed to two desirable features; its fixed-size proof and the very light computation load of the verifier. However, the computation load of the prover in QAP-based zkSNARKs is very heavy, even-though it is designed to be very efficient. This load can be beyond the prover’s computation power to handle, and has to be offloaded to some external servers. In the existing offloading solutions, either (i) the load of computation, offloaded to each sever, is a fraction of the prover’s primary computation (e.g., DZIK), however the servers need to be trusted, (ii) the servers are not required to be trusted, but the computation complexity imposed to each one is the same as the prover’s primary computation (e.g., Trinocchio).

The existing models based on the centralized certificate authority is a feasible method, but it is possible to experience a single point failure. Besides there is a mismatch between the models and real-life scenario since they are only suitable for single patient. Therefore, this paper proposes a practical medical file sharing scheme based on blockchain and decentralized attribute-based encryption. The blockchain is used to record application and grant of authorizations. Smart contracts provide an interactive platform for all users in the system. By utilizing decentralized attribute-based encryption, fine-grained access control of medical files is carried out to ensure privacy and security as well as avoiding single point failure. Attribute-based algorithm that support multi-person democratic decision making and dynamic personnel changes are designed to make the model much closer to the real scene.

Herein, this paper discusses an in-depth survey of a blockchain-based approach for malicious node detection, an exhaustive examination of the integration of blockchain techniques with WSNs (BWSN), and insights into this novel concept. This survey discusses the architecture, sector-wise applications, and uses of BWSN. Moreover, this survey describes malicious node detection based on BWSN in two parts: 1) the BWSN architecture for detecting the malicious nodes and 2) the smart contract aspects in malicious node detection. Next, this survey explains the contributions of blockchain for WSN data management, which involves online information aggregation and may include auditing, event logs, and storage for information analysis and offline query processing. This survey first presents the conventional WSN solutions then the blockchain-based WSN solutions for data management. Additionally, this survey discusses the contributions of blockchain for WSN security management. It first examines the centralized WSN models for security problems, followed by a discussion of the blockchain-based WSN solutions for security management, such as offering access control, preserving information integrity, guaranteeing privacy, and ensuring WSNs’ node longevity.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3111923","Korea Institute for Advancement of Technology (KIAT) grant funded by the Korea Government (MOTIE), The Competency Development Program for Industry Specialist(grant numbers:P0008703); Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), South Korea, under the Information Technology Research Center (ITRC) Support Program IITP-2021-2018-0-01799 supervised by the Institute for Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9535517","Wireless sensor networks (WSNs);blockchain technology;malicious node detection;network security management;distributed consensus algorithm","Wireless sensor networks;Blockchains;Peer-to-peer computing;Security;Computer architecture;Smart contracts;Security management","blockchains;decision making;query processing;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","malicious node detection;sensor nodes;malicious node discovery technologies;blockchain-based WSN solutions;blockchain-based wireless sensor networks;centralized decision-making approach;WSN security management;offline query processing","","","","159","CCBY","10 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving trust management system to evaluate the trustworthiness of vehicles by exploiting the recent advanced blockchain techniques. Specifically, we build up a trust evaluation blockchain, where the trustworthiness of an involved vehicle is evaluated by distributed road-side units (RSUs) based on the rating feedback from neighboring vehicles. To enable efficient and privacy-preserving trust evaluation, we deploy the feedback messages aggregation and trust evaluation on two smart contracts, which are executed and verified by distributed RSUs automatically. In particular, identity authentication based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) cryptosystem is introduced to prevent privacy leakage of vehicles.

Meanwhile, inherent vulnerabilities of IoT systems (including firmware and software) have been continually uncovered and thus the systems are always exposed to various attacks. The root cause of the issue is that IoT systems always have design flaws and implementation bugs. In particular, the released systems (e.g., by third-party marketplaces and IoT vendors) may be maliciously repackaged with malware. Unfortunately, IoT consumers are not able to effectively capture such vulnerabilities because of the limited detection capabilities. In this paper, we propose SmartCrowd, a blockchain-based platform that aims to outsource security detection of IoT systems to distributed detectors with strong detection incentives. SmartCrowd enables built-in accountability for IoT providers and authoritative references of detection results for IoT consumers. By building smart contracts, we can incentivize the efficient and high-coverage security detection of IoT systems, while providing decentralized and automated incentives for both IoT providers releasing secure IoT systems and detectors uncovering vulnerabilities. We present the security and theoretical analysis that demonstrates the security of SmartCrowd and the incentives for participators. We prototype SmartCrowd by using Ethereum and the experimental results show that SmartCrowd has both technical feasibility and financial benefits, which can be applied to build a secure IoT ecosystem.","2575-8411","978-1-7281-2519-0","10.1109/ICDCS.2019.00113","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8884853","Incentives, Blockchain, Decentralization, Automation, IoT System Detection","Detectors;Blockchain;Security;Ecosystems;Smart contracts;Malware","cloud computing;computer network security;Internet of Things;invasive software;mobile computing;peer-to-peer computing","IoT providers;secure IoT systems;SmartCrowd;secure IoT ecosystem;distributed IoT system detection;Internet of Things devices;IoT vendors;IoT consumers;coverage security detection;Ethereum","","5","","53","","31 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consequently consortiums are exploring private blockchains to keep their membership and transactions private. However, private blockchains do not provide adequate protection against potential collusion by consortium members to revert the state of the blockchain. To countenance this, the private blockchain state may be ""pinned"" to a tamper resistant public blockchain. Existing solutions offering pinning to the public blockchain would reveal the transaction rate of the private blockchain, and do not provide a mechanism to contest the validity of a pin. Moreover, they require that all transactions and members of the private blockchain be revealed. These challenges are hampering the wider adoption of private blockchain technology. We describe the primary author's ""Anonymous State Pinning approach"", which overcomes these limitations and present a security proof to demonstrate pins can be challenged without compromising these properties. We perform a gas cost analysis of the implementation to estimate the operating cost of this technology, which shows that pinning a private blockchain at the rate of one pin per hour would cost US$508 per year. A hierarchical pinning approach is proposed which would allow many private blockchains to pin to a management blockchain which would then pin to Ethereum MainNet.

While it is valuable, traditional crowdsourcing systems lock computation resources inside each individual system where tasks cannot reach numerous potential workers among the other systems. Therefore, there is a great need to build a federated platform for different crowdsourcing systems to share resources. However, the security issue lies in the center of constructing the federated crowdsourcing platform. Although many studies are focusing on privacy-preserving crowdsourcing, existing solutions require a trusted third party to perform the key management, which is not applicable in our federated platform. The reason is that it is difficult for a third party to be trusted by various systems. In this paper, we present a secure crowdsourcing framework as our initial effort toward this direction, which bridges together the recent advancements of blockchain and cryptographic techniques. Our proposed design, named PFcrowd, allows different crowdsourcing systems to perform encrypted task-worker matching over the blockchain platform without involving any third-party authority. The core idea is to utilize the blockchain to assist the federated crowdsourcing by moving the task recommendation algorithm to the trusted smart contract. To avoid third-party involvement, we first leverage the re-writable deterministic hashing (RDH) technique to convert the problem of federated task-worker matching into the secure query authorization. We then devise a secure scheme based on RDH and searchable encryption (SE) to support privacy-preserving task-worker matching via the smart contract. We formally analyze the security of our proposed scheme and implement the system prototype on Ethereum. Extensive evaluations of real-world datasets demonstrate the efficiency of our design.","1548-615X","978-1-7281-6887-6","10.1109/IWQoS49365.2020.9212891","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9212891","Federated Crowdsourcing;Re-writable Deterministic Hashing;Searchable Encryption;Blockchain","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Indexes;Cryptography;Authorization;Contracts","authorisation;crowdsourcing;cryptocurrencies;cryptography;distributed databases;file organisation","federated crowdsourcing framework;computation resources;federated crowdsourcing platform;privacy-preserving crowdsourcing;secure crowdsourcing framework;encrypted task-worker matching;blockchain platform;third-party authority;task recommendation algorithm;privacy-preserving task-worker matching;query authorization security;federated task-worker matching platform;cryptographic techniques;searchable encryption;SE;PFcrowd;RDH technique;rewritable deterministic hashing technique;Ethereum","","3","","52","","6 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Also, in project activities there are capital costs that include infrastructure as well as technology costs, operational expenses and several direct and indirect expenses. Block chain technology can play a vital role in these transactions and can have wide scope in the area of logistics particularly in supply order processing including smart contracting, supply chain management, energy management, assets transfer, part processing, design, patent handling, electronic commerce, digital strategies and in ERP methodologies. While the idea of such a system is proposed to be the most preferred mode of transactions with data security and traceability and decentralization there are several challenges that need to be addressed before its implementation in totality.

In this paper, we propose a Machine Learning Regression-based gas price predicting approach (MLR), aiming to find the lowest transaction gas price in the next block for carrying out economical Ethereum transaction. Specifically, we identify five influencing factors (i.e., difficulty, block gas limit, transaction gas limit, ether price, and miner reward) from the Ethereum transacting process and resort the classic machine learning regression to build the predicting model.

The main challenge posed to the region's electricity sector is the large investment gap needed to finance new power projects. The employment of new and innovative financing options is required to bridge this investment gap. Independent power projects have become one of the fastest-growing sources of new finance in the region. However, their development is constrained by the limited availability of debt finance for project implementation. The limited capital and bureaucratic burden of traditional financial institutions coupled with the high risks in the region ensures that the debt finance required by independent power projects is raised only after an arduous voyage and at high interest rates. We address these challenges by proposing a novel decentralized finance instrument, a blockchain special purpose vehicle that streamlines the processes in the financial layer of a traditional special purpose vehicle-finance mobilization, revenue collection, and revenue disbursal. Specifically, the proposed decentralized finance instrument facilitates the mobilization of finance for the special purpose vehicle from a location-independent crowd, revenue collection from the electricity off taker in a risk-mitigated manner, and disbursal of eventual project revenues to investors.","","978-1-7281-2956-3","10.1109/ENERGYCon48941.2020.9236599","Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9236599","Decentralized Finance;Blockchain;Smart Contracts and Renewable Electricity","Instruments;Employment;Finance;Blockchain;Africa;Reliability;Investment","cryptocurrencies;financial management;investment;renewable energy sources;risk analysis","social development;human development;electricity sector;investment gap;innovative financing options;independent power projects;debt finance;traditional financial institutions;high interest rates;novel decentralized finance instrument;blockchain special purpose vehicle;finance mobilization;revenue collection;location-independent crowd;eventual project revenues;sub-Saharan Africa;economic development;independent renewable electricity project financing;risk-mitigation;eventual project revenue disbursal","","2","","20","","29 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For discriminating between different components, a filter exhibits a frequency-selective response that, however, is not able to distinguish between different signals whose spectrum falls within the passband of the filter itself. In this regard, some electromagnetic structures exhibiting, at the same frequency, different responses depending on the waveform of the incoming waves have been recently proposed. In this communication, we extend the aforementioned approach to the case of a standard waveguide filtering module. In particular, by loading a bandpass filtering iris with a proper lumped-element circuit, we design a waveguide component able to distinguish between different pulsed waves, even at the same frequency, depending on their pulsewidth. Moreover, by using this filter for capping an open-ended rectangular waveguide, a radiating element with both frequency- and time-domain selectivity properties is presented. The structures discussed in this communication may pave the way to a new class of microwave systems that, being both frequency selective and time selective, are less sensitive to noise and interferences.","1558-2221","","10.1109/TAP.2020.2977761","Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research(grant numbers:PRIN 2017 Project (protocol number 2017HZJXSZ)); frame of the activities of the research contract CYBER-PHYSICAL ELECTROMAGNETIC VISION: Context-Aware Electromagnetic Sensing and Smart Reaction; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9028087","Filtering modules;time-domain response;waveguide components;waveform selectivity","Electromagnetic waveguides;Iris;Microwave filters;Band-pass filters;Time-domain analysis;RLC circuits","antenna radiation patterns;aperture antennas;band-pass filters;microwave antennas;microwave filters;rectangular waveguides;time-frequency analysis;waveguide antennas;waveguide filters","aperture antennas;time-domain selectivity properties;microwave systems;signal-to-noise ratio;unwanted interferences;frequency-selective response;electromagnetic structures;standard waveguide filtering module;lumped-element circuit;rectangular waveguide components;bandpass filtering iris modules;frequency-domain selectivity properties","","5","","20","IEEE","9 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Among others, one kind of such systems is the popular crowdsensing systems which promise convenient data collection and aggregation. Although promising, leveraging public blockchains to build crowdsensing systems is non-trivial and has to overcome several barriers. First, public blockchains are transparent and lack support for data privacy. Second, participants from the open blockchain environment may misbehave in serving crowdsensing applications, like providing invalid data or doing aggregation incorrectly. Further, on-chain processing incurs monetary cost, so simply putting all workload on-chain is highly uneconomical and a delicate joint on-chain and off-chain design is required. In this paper, we take the first research attempt and explore a new design point to bridge public blockchains with crowdsensing systems. We propose a framework for building private, robust, and verifiable blockchain-empowered crowdsensing systems. It features an open service paradigm where blockchain nodes can rent out their computing resources to serve crowdsensing applications, with custom and full-fledged mechanisms to foster a healthy and economical ecosystem and to simultaneously tackle the challenges of data privacy, robustness against misbehaving participants, and service correctness assurance.

Furthermore, the existing crowdsensing quality control methods are mostly based on a central platform, which is not completely trusted in reality and results in the existence of fraud and other problems. To solve these two questions, a crowdsensing quality control model based on a two-consensus blockchain is proposed in this paper. First, the idea of a blockchain is introduced into this model. The credit-based verifier selection mechanism and the two-consensus approach are proposed to realize the nonrepudiation and nontampering of information in crowdsensing. Then, to help task publishers obtain higher-quality sensing data, the methods of node matching and QGE are proposed. The former method uses the idea of the calculation of matching degree to select workers, and the latter uses the idea of clustering and fuzzy theories to evaluate the quality of the sensing data.

Blockchain technology presents an opportunity for the real estate sector as it has the potential to bring about more efficient transactions. This study examines two approaches to executing real estate transactions; the South African case and an international blockchain technology use case. Two conceptual models are presented using Business Process Modelling and Notation. Document review was employed in order to provide sufficient information on the real estate transactions. The findings show that the South African real estate transaction process is inefficient as it is manual, involves paper-based documents and relies heavily on third parties which result in numerous bottlenecks. The study revealed that blockchain-based transactions are more efficient and reduce reliance on third parties and manual processes.

It promises building better trust, transparency, and integrity without a third-party and the risk of censorship. These remarkable advantages do however come at a price. The blockchain ecosystem is riddled with human-centric and economical issues for its participants, leading to unintended consequences in decentralized networks. Gamified software engineering is a growing field that in particular taps into gamification technology, the application of game mechanics in non-game contexts, to address human-related concerns. There are currently no studies around blockchain that have been identified to have a clear view of existing research and solutions for utilizing the gamification in the emerging blockchain systems.

Therefore, knowledge trading is needed for paid sharing in edge-AI enabled IoT. Most existing works only focus on knowledge generation rather than trading in IoT. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a peer-to-peer (P2P) knowledge market to make knowledge tradable in edge-AI enabled IoT.

Moreover, we develop a knowledge consortium blockchain for secure and efficient knowledge management and trading for the market, which includes a new cryptographic currency knowledge coin, smart contracts, and a new consensus mechanism proof of trading.

A Data Center Network (DCN) constitutes the communicational backbone of a data center, ascertaining the performance boundaries for cloud infrastructure. The DCN needs to be robust to failures and uncertainties to deliver the required Quality of Service (QoS) level and satisfy Service Level Agreement (SLA). In this paper, we analyze robustness of the state-of-the-art DCNs. Our major contributions are: (a) we present multi-layered graph modeling of various DCNs; (b) we study the classical robustness metrics considering various failure scenarios to perform a comparative analysis; (c) we present the inadequacy of the classical network robustness metrics to appropriately evaluate the DCN robustness; and (d) we propose new procedures to quantify the DCN robustness. Currently, there is no detailed study available centering the DCN robustness.

The instrument is being developed by a European industrial consortium under ESA GSTP contract. The onboard data handling system is made for realtime data processing, enabling Level-2 generation onboard and therefore drastically reducing the amount of data to be downloaded and processed. It is designed to be operated upon nano- (such as CubeSats) or micro-satellites, or also on board larger platforms. The instrument will have unprecedented low mass and low power consumption. This hyperspectral imager will achieve a performance level high enough to reliably accomplish the tasks of early warnings via change detection monitoring, providing situational awareness to the end user The target platform of the current study is a 3U CubeSat, where 1U is dedicated to the HyperCube accommodation. The possibility of fitting within the cubic centimeter order of magnitude is provided by the state-of-art and extremely lightweighted reflective optics and telescope design operating in the VNIR range, made possible thanks to new technologies and materials, such as single point diamond turning and RSA aluminum. The signal-to-noise ratio, the spectral resolution, the ground sampling distance and the spectral bandwidth are sufficient for early warning of many natural events, e.g. flooding, forest fires, landslides, stress on vegetation. Furthermore, any other variation of the soil spectral signature, as for example illegal dumps, can also be detected. If used onboard larger satellites, the very wide swath, the L2 realtime data processing and the minimal impact at system level make the HyperCube attractive as an ancillary instrument providing real time phenomena information either to the larger primary payload or to a ground control room. This enables smart operational planning for large payloads.","","978-1-4799-7569-3","10.1109/MetroAeroSpace.2015.7180716","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7180716","hyperspectral;cubesat;remote sensing;early warning","Hypercubes;Optical filters;Hyperspectral imaging;Mirrors;Telescopes;Optical diffraction","geophysical image processing;geophysical techniques;hyperspectral imaging;image resolution;remote sensing","intelligent hyperspectral imager;European industrial consortium;ESA GSTP contract;onboard data handling system;realtime data processing;level-2 generation;CubeSats;microsatellites;power consumption;early warnings;change detection monitoring;situational awareness;HyperCube accommodation;VNIR range;RSA aluminum;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral resolution;ground sampling distance;spectral bandwidth;natural events;flooding;forest fires;landslides;vegetation;stress analysis;soil spectral signature;L2 realtime data processing;ancillary instrument;real time phenomena information;primary payload;ground control room;operational payload planning","","2","","3","","6 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

From IPFS we use the IPFS hash to the transaction into the block of the Blockchain. Together with IPFS, IDS and a Customized Authenticator Service (CAS) we propose a model for authentication and integrity management.

However, this trend is also raising the risk of potential data manipulation attacks. In decentralized networks, defense mechanisms against external entities have been widely enabled while protection against insider attackers is still the weakest link of the chain. Most of the platforms are based on the assumption that all the insider nodes are trustworthy. However, these nodes are exploiting of this assumption to lead manipulation attacks and violate data integrity and reliability without being detected. To address this problem, we propose a secure decentralized management system able to detect insider malicious nodes. Our proposal is based on a three layer architecture: storage layer, blockchain based network layer and IoT devices layer. In this paper, we mainly focus on the network layer where we propose to integrate a decentralized trust based authorization module. This latter allows updating dynamically the nodes access rights by observing and evaluating their behavior. To this aim, we combine probabilistic modelling and stochastic modelling to classify and predict the nodes behavior. Conducted performance evaluation and security analysis show that our proposition provides efficient detection of malicious nodes compared to other trust based management approaches.","2160-4894","978-1-7281-9722-7","10.1109/WiMob50308.2020.9253441","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9253441","Security;trust;authorization;On-Off attack;blockchain;smart contract;Markov chain","Blockchain;Authorization;Permission;Medical services;Stochastic processes;Probabilistic logic","authorisation;computer network security;data integrity;health care;Internet of Things;medical information systems;stochastic processes;trusted computing","stochastic approach;enhanced trust management;decentralized healthcare environment;medical institutions;IoT platforms;healthcare treatment abilities;data manipulation attacks;decentralized networks;defense mechanisms;external entities;insider attackers;data integrity;reliability;secure decentralized management system;insider malicious nodes;storage layer;blockchain based network layer;IoT devices layer;decentralized trust based authorization module;probabilistic modelling modelling;stochastic modelling;security analysis;trust based management approaches","","","","11","","13 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, autonomy of the vehicle and lack of recharging stations are barriers that need to be overcome in order to make the service reliable and broadly accepted. To tackle this problem, French GreenFeed project is working to define and implement an interoperable and universal architecture to allow EV-recharge roaming. In this work, we consider such architecture and focus on issues faced by the e-mobility operator (EMO) and identified by the GreenFeed project. The EMO, a key actor in the architecture, maintains contracts with EV users to allow EV recharge at any geographical place (recharge roaming) through agreements with charging infrastructure operators. The interest of the EMO is to schedule the recharge demands and fulfil the contracts while maximizing its revenue. We analyse different online EV recharge scheduling under different pricing models, agreed between the EV users and the EMO, to study their impact on the EMO's revenues. In this analysis, we assume recharges arriving at random times and requesting a certain amount of energy during a fixed time period. We simulate a scenario with real day-ahead hourly electricity prices over two years and different scheduling polices to illustrate the feasibility of online recharge scheduling.","","978-1-4673-7194-0","10.1109/ISCC.2015.7405497","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7405497","","Pricing;Green products;Computer architecture;Scheduling;Processor scheduling;Batteries;Mathematical model","electric vehicles;environmental factors;open systems;pricing;scheduling;smart cities","online electric vehicle recharge scheduling;e-mobility operator pricing model;EV users;clean transportation technology;clear environmental;future modern smart cities;EV recharging station;French GreenFeed project;interoperable architecture;universal architecture;EV-recharge roaming;EMO revenue;day-ahead hourly electricity price","","","","28","","15 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The design of such complex networked systems demand a more rigorous approach to the modeling and analysis at a higher level of abstraction, which can be inherited from the field of formal methods in software engineering for safety critical systems. Presently, network or security engineers do not use a formal method based software engineering approach to design and build cybersecurity systems. Thus, we propose a software engineering based formal approach to model and analyze cybersecurity, that along with identification of concrete requirements enables automated analysis to guarantee cybersecurity properties are satisfied within the network. In this research paper, we discuss an ontology guided assume-guarantee based formal approach to model and analyze a designed network. To enable this approach, a domain specific language is designed that allows association of assumptions with components in the network that allows verifying the satisfaction of contracts that are guarantees. The formal language designed includes reserved words are guided by the CyberSecurity domain and the semantic reasoning is based on formal architectural representation.","","978-1-7281-3885-5","10.1109/UEMCON47517.2019.8992971","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8992971","Cybersecurity;Formal Methods;Assurance;Design analysis;Ontology;Confidentiality","","formal languages;formal specification;formal verification;ontologies (artificial intelligence);security of data;software engineering;specification languages","CyberSecurity domain;formal language;designed network;cybersecurity properties;cybersecurity systems;formal method based software engineering approach;security engineers;safety critical systems;modeling analysis;complex networked systems;networked devices interact;robust security policies;security algorithms;smart devices;complex components;cybersecurity solutions;assume-guarantee reasoning;formal architectural representation;semantic reasoning","","","","28","","13 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this series, a recently emerging IDM system is Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) which offers greater control and access to users regarding their identity. This distinctive feature of the SSI IDM system represents a major development towards the availability of sovereign identity to users. uPort is an emerging open-source identity management system providing sovereign identity to users, organisations, and other entities. As an emerging identity management system, it requires meticulous analysis of its architecture, working, operational services, efficiency, advantages and limitations. Therefore, this paper contributes towards achieving all of these objectives. Firstly, it presents the architecture and working of the uPort identity management system.

Registration, authentication and key agreement protocols are considered the most important protocols in any cellular network, since the subscriber and the network trust each other and share a symmetric key. Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) developed security specifications for the user authentication with the provider. However, many researchers targeted these protocols and concluded that there are still some security issues and proposed authentication and key agreement protocols. On the other hand, blockchain is considered one of the emerging technologies that will have a great impact on our life in the coming days. Blockchain grants its security properties such as authenticity and integrity to various applications such as bitcoin, smart contracts, etc. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a novel, efficient and secure authentication and key agreement protocol for 5G networks using blockchain. Our security analysis illustrates that the proposed scheme is secure and withstands the known attacks; denial of service, distributed denial of service, man in the middle, hijacking and compromising attacks. Furthermore, our performance evaluation shows that the proposed scheme is more efficient than the current scheme and also other schemes since it preserves the small battery properties of the user equipment and also preserves the bandwidth of the network.","","978-1-7281-4821-2","10.1109/ICIoT48696.2020.9089507","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9089507","5G;AKA;blockchain;registration;authentication;security;key management;public key;signature","5G mobile communication;Protocols;Authentication;Public key;Cellular networks","3G mobile communication;5G mobile communication;cellular radio;cryptocurrencies;cryptographic protocols;message authentication;private key cryptography;telecommunication security","key agreement protocol;network trust;symmetric key;Third Generation Partnership Project;security specifications;user authentication;security properties;5G networks;security analysis;blockchain-based authentication;fifth generation cellular network;security consideration;3GPP;authentication protocols;bitcoin;smart contracts;distributed denial of service;compromising attacks;hijacking attacks;battery properties","","4","","23","","11 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To guarantee the security requirements of SGIN, anonymous authentication is an essential approach to addressing severe threats such as unauthorized access and impersonation attack, while payment is another common method in service-oriented applications in order to encourage companies to participate and also prevent insider attackers from enjoying services without paying. Existing anonymous authentication protocols for SGIN either require users to involve in heavy computation especially in dynamic scenarios, or do not consider cross-domain authentication. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of cross-company satellite services, and then address the cross-domain authentication and billing issues in SGIN, i.e., we propose a decentralized anonymous authentication scheme supporting fast handover and also achieve fairness for the billing procedures. To reduce the authentication delays, the authentication process is delegated from ground to satellites, such that users can arbitrarily switch the satellite networks belonging to different companies. Specifically, users can be anonymously authenticated by showing the knowledge of a secret bound with a randomized verifiable credential and connect to different satellite networks through a fast handover authentication protocol building on a blockchain. Even all companies collude, they cannot forge a valid identity credential and access records for a user. In addition, we provide a fair billing mechanism that can prevent malicious users and greedy satellite companies from manipulating the network accessing fees based on a well-designed smart contract. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme is secure and efficient through security analysis and performance evaluation.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2021.3091775","National Key R&D Plan of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1005600,2017YFB0802200,2018YFB1003701); Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020B0101360001); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071122,62072215,U1736203,61825203,61732021,61702222,61877029,61932010,61932011); Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou of China(grant numbers:202007040004,201802010061); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9463706","Space-ground networks;handover authentication;cross-company;fair billing","Satellites;Authentication;Companies;Blockchain;Security;Privacy;Handover","authorisation;blockchains;cryptographic protocols;mobile satellite communication;mobility management (mobile radio);telecommunication security","space-ground integrated network;SGIN;global coverage;security requirements;unauthorized access;impersonation attack;service-oriented applications;insider attackers;anonymous authentication protocols;cross-domain authentication;cross-company satellite services;decentralized anonymous authentication scheme;billing procedures;authentication delays;authentication process;satellite networks;fast handover authentication protocol;access records;fair billing mechanism;malicious users;greedy satellite companies;network accessing fees;secret bound;blockchain;identity credential;smart contract;security analysis;performance evaluation","","","","38","IEEE","23 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Trusting a third party has its own ramifications and results in a centralized architecture; therefore, this article addresses these issues by designing a Blockchain-based distributed IoT architecture that uses hash chains for secure key management. The proposed architecture exploits the key characteristics of the Blockchain technology, such as openness, immutability, traceability, and fault tolerance, to ensure data privacy in IoT scenarios and, thus, provides a secure environment for communication. This article also proposes a scheme for secure and efficient key generation and management for mutual authentication between communication entities.

Most permissioned blockchains rely on a Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI)as cryptographic tools to provide security services such as identity authentication and data confidentiality. Using PKI to validate transactions includes validating digital certificates of endorsement peers which creates an overhead in the system. Because public-key operations are computationally intensive, they limit the scalability of blockchain applications. Due to a large modulus size and expensive modular exponentiation operations, public-key operations such as RSA become slower than polynomial-based schemes, which involve a smaller modulus size and a less smaller number of modular multiplications. For instance, the 2048-bit RSA is approximately 15,728 times slower than a polynomial with a degree of 50 and 128-bit modulus size. In this paper, we propose a lightweight polynomial-based key management scheme in the context of a permissioned blockchain. Our scheme involves computationally less intensive polynomial evaluation operations such as additions and multiplications that result in a faster processing compared with public-key schemes. In addition, our proposed solution reduces the overhead of processing transactions and improves the system scalability.

Most of the real-world DApps exercise little of their potential power. The key reason is that the current permissioned blockchain systems suffer from poor performance and lack of confidentiality. To address this issue, we present Hybridchain, a system that combines blockchain with Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). Hybridchain decouples computation from consensus and adopts hierarchical network to minimize the computational burden and latency of on-chain execution by performing most of the heavy-weight computation off-chain. Hybridchain leverages secure communication protocols to enable each participant to share transaction data in a secure way.

However, there are still several problems, such as transparency of state channel networks, transaction traceability, and the incapability that the off-chain state is transferred back on the blockchain network in an ad-hoc manner. To solve the aforementioned problems, we propose a novel state channel solution in the form of a State Channel as a Service, which, although off-chain, still incorporates a secure distributed and decentralized network. This solves the challenge of transparency and traceability while giving users the confidence that only the valid last off-chain state is transferred back on the blockchain network. With the proposed solution, there is no need for users to monitor state channel activities for possible malicious actions. Implementation was performed in the form of a payment channel system, presenting a potential use case for the SCaaS. Furthermore, we performed a security and performance analysis, which shows that the solution is secure and by a factor of 12 more efficient than the classical on-chain payment systems.

Traditional data integrity verification methods generally use encryption techniques to protect data in the cloud, relying on trusted Third Party Auditors (TPAs). Blockchain based data integrity schemes can successfully avoid the trust problem of TPAs, however, they have to face the problems of large computational and communication overhead. To address the issues above, we propose a Blockchain and Bilinear mapping based Data Integrity Scheme (BB-DIS) for large-scale IoT data. In our BB-DIS, IoT data is sliced into shards and homomorphic verifiable tags (HVTs) are generated for sampling verification. Data integrity can be achieved according to the characteristics of bilinear mapping in the form of blockchain transactions. Performance analysis of BB-DIS including feasibility, security, dynamicity and complexity is also discussed in detail. A prototype system of BB-DIS is then presented to illustrate how to implement our verification scheme.

However, researchers faced some challenges to use blockchain in IoT, e.g., latency, hardware and energy constraints, and performance requirements. One of the prominent solutions is the appendable-block blockchain, which uses a hierarchical peer-to-peer (p2p) gateway-based architecture. Additionally, current proposals present simplified evaluation scenarios, usually performed in controlled environments, which do not include important network features, for example, latency. Consequently, a model to evaluate a geographically distributed environment, for example, in a situation in which health data have to be collected from different countries in a pandemic situation, can help to understand the behavior and possible flaws of blockchains. In order to evaluate appendable-block blockchains in a realistic scenario, this paper presents an analysis of different consensus algorithms in geographically distributed hosts, in which latency can impact the performance of main operations in a blockchain, such as block and transaction insertion.","","978-1-7281-7127-2","10.1109/BlackSeaCom48709.2020.9235000","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9235000","Blockchain;appendable-block;performance evaluation;consensus algorithms;geo-distributed IoT","Blockchain;Logic gates;Consensus algorithm;Smart contracts;Proposals;Distributed ledger;Performance evaluation","distributed processing;Internet of Things;internetworking;peer-to-peer computing","block blockchain evaluation;geographically-distributed IoT networks;Things environments;IoT environments;different blockchain characteristics;energy constraints;performance requirements;appendable-block blockchain;peer-to-peer gateway-based architecture;current proposals;simplified evaluation scenarios;important network features;geographically distributed environment;different consensus algorithms;geographically distributed hosts;transaction insertion","","","","35","","27 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, most of the prevalent blockchain networks are built upon the consensus protocols under the crypto-puzzle framework known as proof-of-work. Such protocols face the inherent problem of transaction-processing bottleneck, as the networks achieve the decentralized consensus for transaction confirmation at the cost of very high latency. In this paper, we study the problem of consensus formation in a system of multiple throughput-scalable blockchains with sharded consensus. Specifically, the protocol design of sharded consensus not only enables parallelizing the process of transaction validation with sub-groups of processors, but also introduces the Byzantine consensus protocols for accelerating the consensus processes. By allowing different blockchains to impose different levels of processing fees and to have different transaction-generating rate, we aim to simulate the multi-service provision eco-systems based on blockchains in real world. We focus on the dynamics of blockchain-selection in the condition of a large population of consensus processors. Hence, we model the evolution of blockchain selection by the individual processors as an evolutionary game. Both the theoretical and the numerical analysis are provided regarding the evolutionary equilibria and the stability of the processors' strategies in a general case.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-8088-9","10.1109/ICC.2019.8761130","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8761130","","Blockchain;Program processors;Smart contracts;Peer-to-peer computing;Games;Cryptography","cryptocurrencies;evolutionary computation;game theory;protocols","evolutionary game;consensus provision;permissionless blockchain networks;blockchain selection;consensus processors;blockchain-selection;multiservice provision eco-systems;Byzantine consensus protocols;transaction validation;protocol design;sharded consensus;multiple throughput-scalable blockchains;consensus formation;transaction confirmation;transaction-processing bottleneck;crypto-puzzle framework;prevalent blockchain networks;autonomous systems;general-purpose transaction-driven;permissionless blockchains;decentralized consensus protocols","","3","","13","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, the probability of a node failure increases with the number of nodes. Apart from reducing the provider's computation power and jeopardizing the fulfillment of his contracts, this can also lead to computation time wasting when the crash occurs before finishing the task execution. In order to avoid this problem, efficient checkpoint infrastructures are required, especially in virtualized environments where these infrastructures must deal with huge virtual machine images. This paper proposes a smart checkpoint infrastructure for virtualized service providers. It uses Another Union File System to differentiate read-only from read-write parts in the virtual machine image. In this way, read-only parts can be checkpointed only once, while the rest of checkpoints must only save the modifications in read-write parts, thus reducing the time needed to make a checkpoint. The checkpoints are stored in a Hadoop Distributed File System. This allows resuming a task execution faster after a node crash and increasing the fault tolerance of the system, since checkpoints are distributed and replicated in all the nodes of the provider. This paper presents a running implementation of this infrastructure and its evaluation, demonstrating that it is an effective way to make faster checkpoints with low interference on task execution and efficient task recovery after a node failure.","2374-9709","978-1-4244-5367-2","10.1109/NOMS.2010.5488493","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5488493","","Fault tolerance;Computer crashes;Virtual machining;File systems;Contracts;Lead time reduction;Finishing;Interference;Quality of service;Image restoration","checkpointing;distributed databases;fault tolerant computing;task analysis;virtual machines","checkpoint based fault tolerant infrastructure;virtualized service provider;crash failure;omission failure;node failure;computation time wasting;computation power;checkpoint infrastructure;virtual machine image;union file system;read only part;read write part;Hadoop distributed file system;fault tolerance;task recovery;another union file system","","30","5","19","","17 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to nontrusted environments, it is difficult for vehicles to evaluate the credibility of the messages that they receive. Therefore, trust establishment in IoV is a key security concern that is constantly limited by scalability challenges. This article proposes a blockchain-based protocol for IoV using smart contracts, physical unclonable functions (PUFs), certificates, and a dynamic Proof-of-Work (dPoW) consensus algorithm. The blockchain, in conjunction with contracts, provides a secure framework for registering trusted vehicles and blocking malicious ones. PUFs are used to assign a unique identity to each vehicle via which trust is established. Certificates are issued by roadside units that preserve the privacy of vehicles, whereas the dPoW consensus allows the protocol to scale according to the incoming traffic generated by the vehicles. To demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of the proposed protocol, security and performance analyses are presented.

Although, there are many existing energy-aware approaches focusing on minimizing energy consumption while ignoring the SLA violation at the time of a virtual machine (VM) selection from overloaded hosts. Also, they do not consider that the current network traffic causes performance degradation and thus may not really reduce SLA violation under a variety of workloads. In this context, this paper proposes three adaptive models, namely, gradient descent-based regression (Gdr), maximize correlation percentage (MCP), and bandwidth-aware selection policy (Bw), that can significantly minimize energy consumption and SLA violation. Energy-aware methods for overloaded host detection and VM selection from an overloaded host are necessary to improve the energy efficiency and SLA violation of a cloud data center after migrating all VM from underloaded host turn to idle host, which switch to energy-saving mode is also beneficial. Gdr and MCP are adaptive energy-aware algorithms based on the robust regression model, for overloaded host detection. A Bw dynamic VM selection policy selects VM according to the network traffic from the overloaded host under SLAs. Experimental results on the real workload traces show that the proposed algorithms reduce energy consumption while maintaining the required performance levels in a cloud data center using a CloudSim simulator to validate the proposed algorithms.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2872750","National Key Research and Development Plan(grant numbers:2016YFB0800801); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672186,61472108); Australian Research Council(grant numbers:DPDP170103305); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8479359","Cloud computing;cloud data center;energy-efficiency;green computing;host overloaded detection;regression method;service level agreements","Cloud computing;Data centers;Heuristic algorithms;Servers;Energy consumption;Resource management;Dynamic scheduling","cloud computing;computer centres;contracts;energy conservation;energy consumption;power aware computing;regression analysis;resource allocation;virtual machines","energy-aware methods;overloaded host detection;energy efficiency;cloud data center;energy-saving mode;adaptive energy-aware algorithms;cloud computing;Bw dynamic VM selection policy;bandwidth-aware selection policy;virtual machine selection;SLA violation;large-scale cloud data centers;high energy consumption","","18","","32","OAPA","2 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, DOs, after their data are outsourced, do not have complete control of the data, and therefore, external systems are incorporated to manage the data. Several kinds of research refer to the use of encryption techniques to prevent unauthorized access to data but prove to be deficient in providing suitable solutions to the problem. In this article, we propose a secure fine-grain access control system for outsourced data, which supports read and write operations to the data. We make use of an attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme, which is regarded as a suitable scheme to achieve access control for security and privacy (confidentiality) of outsourced data. This article considers different categories of data users, and make provisions for distinct access roles and permissible actions on the outsourced data with dynamic and efficient policy updates to the corresponding ciphertext in cloud repositories. We adopt blockchain technologies to enhance traceability and visibility to enable control over outsourced data by a DO.

However, during this period, people must take precautions for safety purposes. One of the essential steps towards eliminating or reducing the effect of COVID-19 is maintaining social distancing while in public places. Some people are neglecting the social distancing norms while on the move. Still, no surveillance system exists, which monitors the people’s movement for social distancing and securely & efficiently shares the information with the concerned administration department. There also exists no penalty system which forces the people to ensure social distancing. Motivated from the aforementioned facts, in this paper, we present a blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI)-envisioned scheme for monitoring social distancing to combat COVID-19 situations. The proposed scheme uses fast region-based convolutional neural networks (RCNN) and you only look once (YOLO) models for the object (i.e., human) detection through the live video feed captured from the static CCTV cameras as well as lens-equipped drones. Further, the efficient euclidean distance calculation is embedded for calculating the distance between two humans. Blockchain technology ensures the secure and trusted exchange of information between the entities at the physical layer and the administration departments. Blockchain wallets are also used to pay the fine when people do not follow social distance norms. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated based on three broad parameters such as (i) human detection and violation identification, (ii) blockchain simulation and analysis, and (iii) network performance comparison. The parameters considered for (i) is confidence score, for (ii) are scalability, hash rate, and simulation interface, and for (iii) are network bandwidth, throughput, packet loss rate, and network latency.

The proposed methodology uses historical load and corresponding weather data to create a weather sensitive hourly demand model. This model uses 50 alternate weather scenarios to produce a probabilistic range of need attributes. Regression and artificial neural network based techniques for modelling were both evaluated.

Internet of Things involved in this transformation to provide an environment where a patient's vital parameters get transmitted by sensor devices via a gateway onto secure cloud-based platforms where it is stored, aggregated and analyzed. It also helps to store data for millions of patients and performs analysis in real time, ultimately promoting an evidence-based medicine system. Privacy and security are concerns in this environment. Based on the latest trends, this paper introduces a new healthcare paradigm named as SMEAD by developing an end-to-end secured system for assisting diabetic patients. It includes wearables to monitor different parameters thus observe and predict the diabetes status of the patient. The proposed system employs a MEDIBOX which is used to configure the dosage required and provides an alert to the users reminding them to take medication on time. In this case, the insulin dosage is maintained at suitable cooling conditions and is continuously monitored using the mentioned system. To keep all the data secure and to enable access to this data by the doctor and other trusted parties, a Blockchain-based disruptive technology is implemented which facilitates cryptographic security and formalized data access through smart contracts for medical communities. In case of an emergency like missing a dosage, abnormal blood sugar levels or any security lapse, an alert is sent to the caretakers via social networks like Twitter, Facebook or WhatsApp using mobile as a gateway which can continuously communicate the data over the internet that could save patients from fatal effects of the disease.","","978-1-5386-2347-3","10.1109/ANTS.2017.8384099","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8384099","Diabetics Monitoring;MEDIBOX;Blockchain;IOT;Mobile Phone","Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring;Diabetes;Medical diagnostic imaging;Security;Temperature sensors","artificial intelligence;cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;diseases;health care;Internet of Things;medical information systems;mobile computing;patient monitoring;social networking (online)","diagnostic tools;augmented intelligence;sensor devices;gateway;evidence-based medicine system;SMEAD;end-to-end secured system;diabetic patients;medication;insulin dosage;cryptographic security;formalized data access;secured mobile enabled assisting device;wearable health devices;mobile apps;cloud-based platforms;Internet of Things;MEDIBOX;blockchain-based disruptive technology;smart contracts;social networks;diabetics monitoring;patient assisting devices;privacy","","3","1","15","","14 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By providing a persistent, distributed, and append-only ledger, blockchains enable numerous applications such as distributed consensus, robustness against equivocation, and smart contracts. However, recent studies show that blockchain systems such as Bitcoin can be (mis) used to store arbitrary content. This has already been used to store arguably objectionable content on Bitcoin's blockchain. Already single instances of clearly objectionable or even illegal content can put the whole system at risk by making its node operators culpable. To overcome this imminent risk, we survey and discuss the design space of countermeasures against the insertion of such objectionable content. Our analysis shows a wide spectrum of potential countermeasures, which are often combinable for increased efficiency. First, we investigate special-purpose content detectors as an ad hoc mitigation. As they turn out to be easily evadable, we also investigate content-agnostic countermeasures. We find that mandatory minimum fees as well as mitigation of transaction manipulability via identifier commitments significantly raise the bar for inserting harmful content into a blockchain.","","978-1-5386-5008-0","10.1109/IC2E.2018.00070","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8360355","Bitcoin;blockchain;security;objectionable content;countermeasure","Bitcoin;Peer-to-peer computing;Public key;Face","Internet;risk management;security of data","imminent risk;increased efficiency;special-purpose content detectors;content-agnostic countermeasures;harmful content;blockchain systems;distributed consensus;smart contracts;arbitrary content;arguably objectionable content;clearly objectionable content;even illegal content;Bitcoin blockchain;unwanted blockchain content insertion thwarting;ad hoc mitigation;identifier commitments","","16","","29","","17 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To validate our model, we setup an HLF network in our lab and run workload using Hyperledger Caliper. From our analysis results, we find that time to complete the endorsement process is significantly affected by the number of peers and policies such as AND (). The performance bottleneck of the ordering service and ledger write can be mitigated using a larger block size, albeit with an increase in latency. For the committing peer, the transaction validation check (using Validation System Chaincode (VSCC)) is a time-consuming step, but its performance impact can be easily mitigated since it can be parallelized. However, its performance is critical, since it absorbs the shock of bursty block arrivals. We also analyze various what-if scenarios, such as peers processing transactions in a pipeline, and multiple endorsers per organization.","","978-1-5386-7659-2","10.1109/NCA.2018.8548070","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8548070","blockchain;hyperledger fabric;model validation;performance modeling;Stochastic Reward Nets","Fabrics;Peer-to-peer computing;Computational modeling;Throughput;Stochastic processes;Analytical models","electronic money;financial data processing;Markov processes;peer-to-peer computing;queueing theory","hyperledger fabric;stochastic reward nets;hyperledger caliper;mean queue length;performance model;modular architecture;smart contracts;distributed ledger platform;open-source implementation;permissioned blockchain network;performance modeling;performance impact;time-consuming step;transaction validation check;committing peer;larger block size;ordering service;performance bottleneck;endorsement process;HLF network;critical processing stages","","23","","29","","29 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To solve these two problems, an effective blockchain-based location-privacy-preserving crowdsensing model, CrowdBLPS, is proposed in this article. First, the idea of a blockchain is introduced into this model. The decentralized structure and the consensus approach are applied to realize the nonrepudiation and nontampering of information.

Despite its benefits for a wide range of applications, MCS lacks an efficient incentive mechanism, restricting the development of IoT applications, especially for Internet of Vehicles (IoV)-a typical example of IoT applications; this is because vehicles are usually reluctant to participate these sensing tasks. Moreover, in practice, some sensing tasks may arrive suddenly (called an emergent task) in the IoV environment, but the resources of a single vehicle may be insufficient to handle, and thus multivehicles collaboration is required. In this case, the incentive mechanisms for the participation of multiple vehicles and the task scheduling for their collaborations are collectively needed. To address this important problem, we first propose a new model for the scenario of two vehicles collaboration, considering the situation of the emergent appearance of a task. In this model, for a general sensing task, we propose a bidding mechanism to better encourage vehicles to contribute their resources, and the tasks for those vehicles are scheduled accordingly. Second, for an emergent task, a novel time-window-based method is devised to manage the tasks among vehicles and to incent the vehicles to participate.

Specifically, we are interested in situations where fairness among the agents contributing to the platform is needed. A notable example are platforms operated by public bodies, where fairness is a legal requirement. The design of such distributed systems is challenging due to the fact that we wish to simultaneously realise an efficient social sensing platform, but also deliver a predefined quality of service to the agents (for example, a fair opportunity to contribute to the platform). In this paper, we introduce iterated function systems (IFS) as a tool for the design and analysis of systems of this kind. We show how the IFS framework can be used to realise systems that deliver a predictable quality of service to agents, can be used to underpin contracts governing the interaction of agents with the social sensing platform, and which are efficient. To illustrate our design via a use case, we consider a large, high-density network of participating parked vehicles. When awoken by an administrative centre, this network proceeds to search for moving missing entities of interest using RFID-based techniques. We regulate which vehicles are actively searching for the moving entity of interest at any point in time. In doing so, we seek to equalise vehicular energy consumption across the network. This is illustrated through simulations of a search for a missing Alzheimer’s patient in Melbourne, Australia. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the efficacy of our system and the predictability of access of agents to the platform independent of initial conditions.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3085368","OP VVV(grant numbers:CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16 019/0000765); Science Foundation Ireland(grant numbers:16/IA/4610); European Regional Development Fund; Fundao de Amparo Pesquisa do Estado de So Paulo(grant numbers:2016/19504-7); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9445023","Smart Cities;Internet of Things (IoT);Social sensing;Radio Frequency Identification Systems;Ergodicity;Control theory.","Sensors;Automobiles;Internet of Things;Law;Tools;Stochastic systems;Prediction algorithms","","","","","","","IEEE","2 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The potential of the technology has been expanded and rebooted by Ethereum to support a broader range of applications through smart contracts. Transactions and contracts are activated every day in the Ethereum network and blocks are created at a very high rate. Often blocks are mined at conflicting times, which causes a split on the chain or a fork. Forks pose an inconsistency problem on the network until they are solved and the network agrees on the same instance of the blockchain. Transactions included on side forks, once the fork is resolved, are discarded and have to be mined again. Fork rates also impact the overall performance of the blockchain and the security of the system. This work studies how one of the main networking factors, namely communication delay, impacts forking of the blockchain. An analytical model for forking probability is presented. Furthermore, the impact of block distribution delays on the amount of forks is quantified using a private Ethereum blockchain in controlled experiments in a lab.","","978-3-8007-4948-5","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8835935","","","","","","","","","","16 Sep 2019","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

Hyperledger Fabric is one such permissioned blockchain platform and one of the Hyperledger projects hosted by the Linux Foundation.

As the performance of blockchain platform is a major concern for enterprise applications, in this work, we perform a comprehensive empirical study to characterize the performance of Hyperledger Fabric and identify potential performance bottlenecks to gain a better understanding of the system. We follow a two-phased approach. In the first phase, our goal is to understand the impact of various configuration parameters such as block size, endorsement policy, channels, resource allocation, state database choice on the transaction throughput & latency to provide various guidelines on configuring these parameters. In addition, we also aim to identify performance bottlenecks and hotspots. We observed that (1) endorsement policy verification, (2) sequential policy validation of transactions in a block, and (3) state validation and commit (with CouchDB) were the three major bottlenecks. In the second phase, we focus on optimizing Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 based on our observations. We introduced and studied various simple optimizations such as aggressive caching for endorsement policy verification in the cryptography component (3x improvement in the performance) and parallelizing endorsement policy verification (7x improvement). Further, we enhanced and measured the effect of an existing bulk read/write optimization for CouchDB during state validation & commit phase (2.5x improvement).

By leveraging blockchain, this paper puts forward a blockchain and FL fusioned framework to manage the security and trust issues when applying FL over mobile edge networks. First, a two-layered architecture is proposed that consists of two types of blockchains: local model update chain (LMUC) assisted by device-to-device (D2D) communication and global model update chain (GMUC) supporting task sharding. D2D-assisted LMUC is designed to chronologically and efficiently record all of the local model training results, which can help to form a long-term reputation of local devices. The GMUC is proposed to provide both security and efficiency by preventing mobile edge computing (MEC) nodes from malfunctioning and dividing it into logically-isolated FL task-specific chains. Then, a reputation-learning based incentive mechanism is introduced to make the participant local devices more trustful with the reward implemented by a smart contract. Finally, a case study is given to show that the proposed framework performs well in terms of FL learning accuracy and blockchain time delay.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.011.2000339","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9318246","","Blockchain;Computational modeling;Task analysis;Data models;Computer architecture;Security;Training","","","","","","","","8 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To address this issue, we propose an anonymous reputation management system based on dual blockchain architecture, where reputation scores are masked. More precisely, one chain is used to store and update reputation scores, and another chain is responsible for publishing tasks and storing task-related data. To anonymously update and verify the reputation scores without affecting their usages in data sensing process, a kind of ring signature and Pedersen commitment are employed in smart contracts. In addition, a Schnorr signature is generated to make the reputation scores verifiable in the MCS system.

However, RES generation is easily affected by the environment. Meanwhile, the load, such as electric vehicles (EVs) and prosumers, accounts for most low-carbon technology users. Their power is usually superimposed on peak loads without dispatching, which also exacerbates the instability of the power system. Current optimal dispatching mechanisms mainly rely on centralized organizations, while their dispatching process is not open and transparent. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based trustworthy dispatching approach for the distribution network in high renewable energy penetrated power systems. We first develop an optimal dispatching model considering EVs’ charging behavior and the prosumers’ economic benefits. With the model, prosumers can be dispatched to balance power and consume renewable energy, reducing the impact of disorderly charging on the grid and the abandonment of RES generation. An orderly charging iteration optimization (OCIO) algorithm is proposed to implement orderly EV charging while considering the charging cost and the period. We also propose a modified particle swarm optimization (mPSO) algorithm to publish dispatching tasks based on real-time power balance. Furthermore, blockchain is applied as an open and transparent ledger to record each entity’s power generation and consumption information, ensuring that the dispatching process is trustworthy. Finally, the effectiveness of the dispatching approach is verified in the modified IEEE 33-bus test system and Ethereum based smart contracts.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3117924","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9560154","Optimal dispatching;blockchain;electric vehicle;prosumer;renewable energy power generation.","Dispatching;Blockchains;Power system stability;Renewable energy sources;Distribution networks;Costs;Stability analysis","","","","","","","IEEE","6 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In this article, we study the joint computation-offloading and coin-loaning problem for blockchain-empowered MEC to minimize the total cost of all MEs. We introduce the banks that can provide loan services to the MEs to address the above two issues. We formulate the problem as a noncooperative game to model the competitions between the myopic MEs. By using a potential game method, we prove the existence of a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium (NE) and design a distributed algorithm to achieve the NE point with low computational complexity. We also provide an upper bound on the price of anarchy of the game by theoretical proof. Besides, two smart contracts are designed to automatically perform the computing resource trading and coin loaning processes.

First, it maps the internal constituents of Ethereum onto a layered architecture inspired in the ISO/OSI model, so that its provisioning organization can be better understood. Second, it employs the AKF Scale Cube to analyze the pros and cons of the present specification of Ethereum, as well as of the current improvement proposals, so that the scalability challenges can be reasoned about in an orderly fashion. Finally, it uses an extensible test environment with synthetic benchmarks so that the transaction throughput of the current implementation of Ethereum can be evaluated in a private scenario, when no smart contract is to run. Our conclusions suggest that Ethereum respects the scalability trilemma being versed on security and decentralization renouncing scalability. These limits can be mitigated by adopting novel solutions such as Plasma and Sharding which enable a significant increment of performance by partitioning the data, and, ultimately, unlocking parallel execution of the transactions.","2642-6587","978-1-7281-1442-2","10.1109/SOSE.2019.00031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8705874","Ethereum;Scalability;CaaS;Blockchain","Scalability;Blockchain;Proposals;Bitcoin;Computer architecture;Peer-to-peer computing;Throughput","cryptocurrencies;operating systems (computers)","Ethereum;decentralization renouncing scalability;permissionless Blockchain platforms;AKF scale cube;ISO-OSI model","","17","","24","","6 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

PM can be implemented by assembling a system of weak self-organizing computational elements, called particles, that can be programmed via distributed algorithms to collectively achieve some global task. Recent advances in the production of nanotechnologies have rendered such systems increasingly possible in practice, thus triggering research interests from many areas of computer science. The most established models for PM assume that particles: are modeled as finite state automata; are all identical, executing the same algorithm based on local observation of the surroundings; live and operate in the cells of a hexagonal grid; can move from one cell to another by repeatedly alternating between a contracted state (a particle occupies one cell) and an expanded state (a particle occupies two neighboring cells). Given these elementary features, it is rather hard to design distributed algorithms even for basic tasks and, in fact, all existing solutions to solve fundamental problems via PM have resorted to endowing PM systems with various capabilities to overcome such hardness, thus assuming quite unrealistic features. In this paper, we move toward more realistic computational models for PM. Specifically, we first introduce SILBOT, a new modeling approach that relaxes several assumptions used in previous ones. Second, we present a distributed algorithm to solve, in the SILBOT model, a foundational primitive for PM, namely Leader Election. This algorithm works in O(n) rounds for all initial configurations of n particles that are both connected (i.e. particles induce a connected graph) and compact (i.e. without holes, that is no empty cells surrounded by particles occur). As usual in asynchronous contexts, a round is intended as the time within which all particles have been activated at least once. Third, we show that, if the initial configuration admits holes, it is impossible to achieve leader election while preserving connectivity. Finally, by slightly empowering the robots, we design an algorithm to handle initial configurations admitting holes that in O(n<sup>2</sup>) rounds solves the leader election problem while obtaining also compaction.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3038174","Ministero dell’Istruzione, Università e Ricerca (MIUR) PRIN 2017 Project ALGADIMAR ‘‘Algorithms, Games, and Digital Markets’’; Gruppo Nazionale per il Calcolo Scientifico dell’Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica (GNCS-INdAM); Università di Pisa, Italy; Progetto PRA_2018_43; Project ‘‘ASSIOMI–Algorithms, Systems and Devices for Machine Monitoring and Diagnosing in Smart Factories (Algoritmi Sistemi e diSpositivI per mOnitoraggio e diagnostica di Macchine per le fabbriche Intelligenti); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9260223","Programmable matter;swarm robotics;self-organizing systems;leader election;compaction;finite automata;distributed algorithms","Voting;Computational modeling;Compaction;Task analysis;Solid modeling;Lattices;Delays","computational complexity;distributed algorithms","compaction;asynchronous silent programmable matter;distributed algorithm;finite state automata;computational models;SILBOT model;leader election problem;self organizing computational elements","","2","","38","CCBY","16 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

On the business side, rural area has a disadvantage in the competitiveness with the region near the huge market by the transportation cost. To increase competitiveness, the countryside has adopted greenhouse cultivation to maximize the winter crop yield when there is a low yield near the metropolitan area. In addition, most of the farming environments are set up and manipulated by farmers for themselves. Consequently, they need not only knowledge about farming but also Information and Communication Technology (ICT) ability to be able to understand information. However, it is inefficient for new farmers to acquire both ICT skills and agricultural knowledge, so recent smart farms use AI technology to analyze obtained data. As a first step, to provide expertise and support for new farmers, we propose a method to predict the optimal harvest date of eggplant combining past pattern and future feature variables. That is because estimating accurate harvest date is important for crops that have a short period of optimum size, weight or quality. The proposed model is composed of pattern analysis and solar radiation prediction models, and it forecasts the growth rate as a crop's response. We evaluated several methods and the result shows that the proposed method is an efficient tool for predicting the optimal harvest date in IoT-enabled smart greenhouse.

However, malicious attackers or semi-honest participants may undermine the digital forensic procedures. Enabling accountability and privacy-preservation while providing secure data access control in VDF is a non-trivial challenge. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we propose a blockchain-based decentralized solution for VDF named BB-VDF, in which the accountable protocols and privacy-preserving algorithm are constructed. The desirable security properties and fine-grained data access control are achieved based on smart contract and the customized cryptographic construction. Specifically, we design a distributed key-policy attribute based encryption scheme with partially hidden access structures, named DKP-ABE-H, to realize the secure fine-grained forensics data access control. Further, a novel smart contract is designed to model the forensics procedures as a finite state machine, which guarantees accountability that each participant performs auditable cooperation under tamper-resistant and traceable transactions.

A centralized data exchange is not desirable as it leads to a single performance bottleneck. Although a distributed data exchange removes the central bottleneck, it has network performance issues as data passes among multiple coordinators. A decentralized approach is the only solution that fully enables the realization of efficient IoT systems, since there is no single performance bottleneck and network overhead is minimized. In this paper, we present an approach that leverages the semantics of DX-MAN for realizing decentralized data flows in IoT systems. The algebraic semantics of such a model allows a well-defined structure of data flows which is easily analyzed by an algorithm that forms a direct relationship between data consumers and data producers. For the analysis, the algorithm takes advantage of the fact that DX-MAN separates control flow and data flow. Thus, our approach prevents passing data alongside control among multiple coordinators, so data is only read and written on a decentralized data space. We validate our approach using smart contracts on the Blockchain, and conducted experiments to quantitatively evaluate scalability. The results show that our approach scales well with the size of IoT systems.","","978-1-5386-4980-0","10.1109/WF-IoT.2019.8767238","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8767238","Internet of Things;decentralized data flows;Blockchain;DX-MAN;exogenous connectors;scalability;separation between control and data;algebraic service composition","Connectors;Internet of Things;Semantics;Distributed databases;Scalability;Sequential analysis;Analytical models","data flow computing;Internet of Things","DX-MAN;decentralized data flows;data consumers;control flow;multiple coordinators;decentralized data space;scalability;algebraic service compositions;single performance bottleneck;distributed data exchange;network performance issues;efficient IoT systems","","2","","18","","22 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The problem lies in the elimination of corruption through the formation and implementation of the state program Creation of Cyber Physical Space for Digital Monitoring Technological Processes and Optimal Resource Management in order to Achieve Socially Important Goals. The cyber technology for human-free managing social resources (staff and finance) includes two cloud service: 1) the distribution of government contracts and finance between the structures, undertakings and entities, based on competition of their competence matrices for a given metric; 2) allocation of staff vacancies in scalable social groups based on competition of the competence matrices of applicants for a given metric. The competence metric is a measuring method of the distance between objects or processes based on the use of the parameter vector that defines the space or a competence matrix of a person or social group in real time. A competence matrix is a model of integrated activity and skills of a person or social group at a given metric and time interval. As an alternative solution of the problem it is considered a cyber physical system for managing human and financial resources (Cyber Social Systems - CSS), as a scalable cloud service, available to the social groups, government agencies, private companies and private individuals; it provides lifelong monitoring competencies of corresponding subjects in real time in order to carry out cyber staff management through appropriate career, moral and material incentives according to the results of their constructive activity. The cyber social system is focused on the total destruction of the corruption in the actions of managers at all levels by eliminating the subjectivity in the management of human and financial resources on the basis of the transfer of the official functions to independent cloud cyber service. The system consists of two interacting components: 1) accumulative monitoring of all kinds of human (social group) activity that generates a competence matrix in real-time; 2) the optimal management through career, moral and material incentives of individuals and social formations based on the analysis and rating of the corresponding competence matrices. A cyber system is based on the use of the following technologies: Big Data, Internet of Things, Smart Everything, parallel virtual processors and focused on serving individuals, government agencies and companies. For each subject two unique metrics of competencies are generated: 1) the gold standard of indexes for each category of professional activity; 2) the current competence matrix of the subjects filled in the process of their life, which are ranked by metrical comparison or evaluation of the results of work with standard or better values.","","978-1-4799-7630-0","10.1109/EWDTS.2014.7027108","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7027108","","Companies;Monitoring;Educational institutions;Measurement;Personnel;Government;Ethics","Big Data;cloud computing;Internet of Things;parallel processing;socio-economic effects","cyber physical social systems;Ukraine;technological future;social future;economic future;state program;cyber physical space;digital monitoring technological processes;optimal resource management;socially important goals;human-free managing social resources;cyber technology;staff vacancies;scalable social groups;competence metric;competence matrix;cyber social systems;CSS;scalable cloud service;government agencies;private companies;private individuals;lifelong monitoring competencies;material incentives;corruption;independent cloud cyber service;big data;Internet of things;smart everything;parallel virtual processors","","6","","36","","2 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Security detection before system installation is not enough to ensure that IoT devices are always secure, because newly emerging vulnerabilities can still be exploited to launch attacks. To address this issue, retrospective detection is often required to trace the security status of IoT systems. Unfortunately, existing centralized detection mechanisms cannot easily provide a comprehensive security analysis. In particular, consumers cannot automatically receive security notification whenever a new vulnerability is uncovered. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-powered incentive platform, called SmartRetro, that can incentivize and attract more distributed detectors to participate in retrospective vulnerability detection and contribute their detection results. Leveraging smart contracts, consumers in SmartRetro receive automatic security feedback about their installed IoT systems. We perform the security and theoretical analysis to demonstrate that SmartRetro achieves our desirable security goals.We further implement SmartRetro prototype on Ethereum to evaluate its performance.

The overall scheme comprised components of system design, a demonstration phase and analysis of results. The demonstration took place between August 1997 and May 1998. Additionally, it was hoped to be able to assess the extent to which road tolling could contribute to the fulfilment of the traffic management and transport planning aims. LERTS was not designed to be a trial of technology since proven technology exists to implement road tolling. However, it was thought that in order to present a realistic scenario, a technological solution should be used to implement the trial. This would also allow the effect of fee collection, the use of smart card payment systems, and participant's attitudes towards them to be studied. Following the production of a specification and tender document, a contract for the implementation of the road pricing aspects of the demonstration was awarded to Micro-Design ASA of Trondheim, Norway. The scope of this contract was the supply and installation of three 5.8GHz microwave beacons, a smartcard-operated ticket machine to be installed in the new park-and-ride site, on-board units to be fitted into participant's cars, and a central management system to collect, collate and analyse data from the demonstration.","","","10.1049/ic:19990521","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=773106","","","road traffic","Leicester Environmental Road Tolling Scheme;electronic road tolling;urban area;smartcard-operated ticket machine;park-and-ride site;central management system","","","","","","6 Aug 2002","","","IET","IET Conferences"

There is continuous increase in water consumption by industries. Reusing wastewater can reduce water withdrawals from local water sources thus increasing water availability, lowering wastewater discharges and their pollutant load, reducing thermal energy consumption and, potentially, processing cost. Various ways have been implemented for recycling the generated wastewater. Wastewater must be reused for the benefit of mankind. In this paper we propose a wastewater recycle control system to efficiently manage the wastewater and coordinate it among the industries and the government. Blockchain technology has been deployed for storing data and developing an incentive model to encourage wastewater reuse. Tokens are provided to industries in proportion to quantity and quality of reused wastewater. Rules for issue and trade of these tokens are written as a smart contract. Unfortunately, providing such incentives also provides a motive for tampering the data on which these tokens are awarded. Anomaly detection algorithms are used to detect the potential frauds which take place in the system upon IoT meter data tampering. The system uses IoT meters that measure volume of wastewater generated and reused, along with quality metrics such as pH, hardness and oil content. Multiple machine learning algorithms are used to detect tampering- polynomial regression, DBSCAN, autoencoders and LSTM networks. Their performance has then been compared. A first implementation of this system and an evaluation of the system's performance are also presented.","","978-1-5386-5906-9","10.1109/ICCCNT45670.2019.8944586","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8944586","Wastewater Recycle and Reuse;IoT Meter;Blockchain;Anomaly Detection;Machine learning","Water conservation;Wastewater;Meters;Blockchain;Industries;Water pollution;Anomaly detection","costing;cryptography;distributed databases;energy consumption;environmental science computing;fraud;government;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);recycling;regression analysis;wastewater treatment;water conservation;water quality","water consumption;local water sources;thermal energy consumption;wastewater recycle control system;blockchain technology;anomaly detection algorithm;costing;government;wastewater quality;oil content;water hardness level;multiple machine learning algorithm;polynomial regression;LSTM network;DBSCAN;autoencoders;fraud detection;IoT meter data tampering","","1","","19","","30 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since many such mobile applications are computation-intensive, mobile edge computing (MEC), a promising computing paradigm that can provide on-demand computation resources (i.e., virtual machines (VMs)), is considered to adopt for allowing MUs to offload their computation tasks to EgSvrs in the proximity. Previous works have developed many schemes to schedule computation tasks to be offloaded to edge servers (EgSvrs). However, these developed schemes are centralized, which are vulnerable to congested coordination operations, and have no trustworthiness guarantee as well. In this paper, we propose to design a decentralized coordination scheme to orchestrate MUs and EgSvrs for scheduling computation tasks to their right VMs by taking advantage of blockchain technology. Specifically, we develop an efficient task-VM matching algorithm that jointly considers task execution time and energy consumption. Particularly, we prove the stability of the task-VM matching achieved by the developed matching algorithm. Besides, we further implement the developed task-VM matching algorithm on the blockchain by developing a smart matching contract to perform task-VM matching on the blockchain without trusted third parties.

But they suffer from certain limitations that make them undesirable in Surveillance applications. Among their limitations is the absence of scalability and security. Currently, these robots do not have framework that allows it to communicate with each other to execute missions autonomously and transparently. Blockchain is the new technology for distributed autonomous systems by providing set of computer nodes for data storage and distribution among the nodes in the system. Each participating node can protect and validate the data in the blockchain system. No modifications can be performed on the data records due to the fact that it is been watched by all the users. Based on the blockchain features, we focus on this research how blockchain applications can make swarm robots securely connected using Ethereum smart contracts. Starting with surveillance missions deployment task, we propose a decentralized application (DApp) for that. Then, blockchain is used by the swarms to establish the Ethereum private networks that allows them to communicate and carry out tasks. We set a test swarm robotics system and evaluate the blockchain for its performance, scalability, recoverability, and responsiveness. In conclusion, we found that blockchain enables a swarm to be globally securely connected, but there are still need for performance enhancement.","","978-1-7281-9664-0","10.1109/ICM50269.2020.9331824","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9331824","Blockchain;Decentralized;Geth applications;Ethereum","Surveillance;Scalability;Swarm robotics;Blockchain;Consensus algorithm;Task analysis;Robots","blockchains;collision avoidance;mobile robots;multi-robot systems;surveillance","computer nodes;data storage;participating node;blockchain system;data records;blockchain features;blockchain applications;swarm robots;surveillance missions deployment task;decentralized application;test swarm robotics system;surveillance applications;distributed autonomous systems;data protection","","","","16","","28 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the integration of blockchain in such networks, information of all granularity levels, from complete blocks to individual transactions, would be accessible to vehicles at any time. Specifically, the blockchain technology is expected to improve the security, immutability, and decentralization of cellular V2X communication through smart contract and distributed ledgers. Although blockchain-based cellular V2X networks hold promise, many challenges need to be addressed to enable the future interoperability and accessibility of such large-scale platforms. One such challenge is the offloading of mining tasks in cellular V2X networks. While transportation authorities may try to balance the network mining load, the vehicles may select the nearest mining clusters to offload a task. This may cause congestion and disproportionate use of vehicular network resources. To address this issue, we propose a game-theoretic approach for balancing the load at mining clusters while maintaining fairness among offloading vehicles. Keeping in mind the low-latency requirements of vehicles, we consider a finite channel blocklength transmission which is more practical compared to the use of infinite blocklength codes. The simulation results obtained with our proposed offloading framework show improved performance over the conventional nearest mining cluster selection technique.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2020.3006176","Business Finland under the Project 5G Finnish Open Research Collaboration Ecosystem (5G-FORCE); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9142451","Blockchain;cellular V2X communications;latency;mining;vehicular","Task analysis;Data mining;Bandwidth;Autonomous vehicles","channel capacity;cloud computing;data mining;data privacy;electronic money;financial data processing;game theory;mobile computing;open systems;peer-to-peer computing","vehicular network resources;offloading vehicles;offloading framework show improved performance;conventional nearest mining cluster selection technique;efficient mining cluster selection;Blockchain-Based Cellular V2X Communications;Cellular vehicle-to-everything communication;autonomous vehicles;granularity levels;complete blocks;individual transactions;blockchain technology;cellular V2X communication;future interoperability;mining tasks;network mining load;nearest mining clusters","","1","","40","IEEE","16 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, traditional systems fail to protect the privacy of task requesters and workers. They typically rely on a centralized server to aggregate the task content and workers' interests, while these data contain sensitive information. Second, crowdsourcing resources in each system are isolated. The tasks in one system cannot reach potential workers in other systems. Thus, there is a great need to build a new privacy-preserving and federated crowdsourcing system. However, the existing privacy-preserving solutions rely on a trusted third party to perform key management, which is not applicable in a federated setting. To this end, we propose the first proxy-free privacy-preserving and federated crowdsourcing system. It interconnects the existing crowdsourcing systems and can perform encrypted task matching across various systems without relying on a trusted third-party authority. Our main idea is to achieve federated crowdsourcing by moving secure task matching to the trusted smart contract. To get rid of the dependence on the trusted authority, we combine the rewritable deterministic hashing technique with searchable encryption schemes to achieve secure on-chain task-matching authorization. Moreover, we utilize the puncturable encryption technique to implement secure authorization revocation. We formally analyze the security of our design and implement a prototype on Ethereum. Evaluation results demonstrate that our design is secure and efficient for blockchain-based crowdsourcing.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3051295","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Shenzhen Basic Research Program(grant numbers:JCYJ20190806143011274); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772154,61572412); Research Grants Council of Hong Kong(grant numbers:CityU 11208917,CityU 11212717,CityU 11217819,CityU 11217620,CityU C1008-16G); Innovation and Technology Commission of Hong Kong through ITF Project(grant numbers:ITS/145/19); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9321457","Blockchain;federated crowdsourcing;puncturable encryption;rewritable deterministic hashing (RDH);searchable encryption (SE)","Task analysis;Crowdsourcing;Blockchain;Cryptography;Encryption;Authorization;Privacy","blockchains;crowdsourcing;data privacy;private key cryptography;trusted computing","privacy-preserving solutions;federated setting;federated crowdsourcing system;secure task;blockchain-based crowdsourcing;crowdsourcing systems;secure authorization revocation;secure on-chain task-matching authorization;searchable encryption schemes;proxy-free privacy-preserving system;blockchain;rewritable deterministic hashing technique","","","","44","IEEE","13 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

VANETs are affected by issues such as identity validity and message reliability when vehicle nodes share data with other nodes. The method used to allow the vehicle nodes to upload sensor data to a trusted center for storage is susceptible to security risks, such as malicious tampering and data leakage. To address these security challenges, we propose a data security sharing and storage system based on the consortium blockchain (DSSCB). This digital signature technique based on the nature of bilinear pairing for elliptic curves is used to ensure the reliability and integrity when transmitting data to a node. The emerging consortium blockchain technology provides a decentralized, secure, and reliable database, which is maintained by the entire network node. In DSSCB, smart contracts are used to limit the triggering conditions for preselected nodes when transmitting and storing data and for allocating data coins to vehicles that participate in the contribution of data. The security analysis and performance evaluations demonstrated that our DSSCB solution is more secure and reliable in terms of data sharing and storage.

However, the use of these technologies has also raised questions and concerns about security and privacy risks. To assist in resolving this issue, this paper proposes a blockchain-based access control framework for managing access to users’ medical data. This is facilitated by using a smart contract on the blockchain, which allows for delegated access control and secure user authentication. This solution leverages blockchain technology’s inherent autonomy and immutability to solve the existing access control challenges. We have presented the solution in the form of a medical wearable sensor prototype and a mobile app that uses the Ethereum blockchain in a real data sharing control scenario. Based on the empirical results, the proposed solution has proven effective. It has the potential to facilitate reliable data exchange while also protecting sensitive health information against potential threats.

Consequently, it is natural that IoT becomes the driving force to meet the increasing demand for frictionless transactions. To secure transactions in IoT, blockchain is widely deployed since it can remove the necessity of a trusted central authority. However, the mainstream blockchain-based IoT payment platforms, dominated by Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithms, face several major security and scalability challenges that result in system failures and financial loss. Among the three leading attacks in this scenario, double-spend attacks and long-range attacks threaten the tokens of blockchain users, while eclipse attacks target denial of service. To defeat these attacks, a novel bidirectional-linked blockchain (BLB) using chameleon hash functions is proposed, where bidirectional pointers are constructed between blocks. Furthermore, a new Committee Members Auction (CMA) consensus algorithm is designed to improve the security and attack resistance of BLB while guaranteeing high scalability. In CMA, distributed blockchain nodes elect committee members through a verifiable random function. The smart contract uses Shamir’s Secret Sharing scheme to distribute the trapdoor keys to committee members. To better investigate BLB’s resistance against double-spend attacks, an improved Nakamoto’s attack analysis is presented. In addition, a modified entropy metric is devised to measure eclipse attack resistance across different consensus algorithms. Extensive evaluation results show the superior resistance against attacks and demonstrate high scalability of BLB compared with current leading paradigms based on PoS and PoW.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3103275","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9509292","Bidirectional blockchain;IoT;Double-spend attack;Long-range attack;Eclipse attack;Scalability.","Blockchains;Scalability;Consensus algorithm;Cryptography;Resistance;Internet of Things;Hash functions","","","","","","","IEEE","9 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Consequently, infrastructure providers (InPs) desire virtualized networks to share their subleased resources for effective resource management. Nonetheless, security and privacy challenges in the wireless network deter operators from collaborating with one another for resource trading. Lately, blockchain technology has received overwhelming attention for secure resource trading thanks to its security features. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical framework for blockchain-based resource trading among peer-to-peer (P2P) mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), for autonomous resource slicing in 5G RAN. Specifically, a consortium blockchain network that supports hyperledger smart contract (SC) is deployed to set up secure resource trading among seller and buyer MVNOs. With the aim of designing a fair incentive mechanism, we model the pricing and demand problem of the seller and buyers as a two-stage Stackelberg game, where the seller MVNO is the leader and buyer MVNOs are followers. To achieve a Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) for the formulated game, a dueling deep Q-network (Dueling DQN) scheme is designed to achieve optimal pricing and demand policies for autonomous resource allocation at negotiation interval. Comprehensive simulation results analysis prove that the proposed scheme reduces double spending attacks by 12% in resource trading settings, and maximizes the utilities of players. The proposed scheme also outperforms deep Q-Network (DQN), Q-learning (QL) and greedy algorithm (GA), in terms of slice and system level satisfaction and resource utilization.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2021.3124046","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771098); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:ZYGX2018J068); Department of Science and Technology of Sichuan Province(grant numbers:2020YFQ0025); Intelligent Terminal Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province(grant numbers:SCITLAB-200025); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9594082","blockchain;deep reinforcement learning;network slicing;resource trading;Stackelberg game;5G.","Blockchains;Resource management;5G mobile communication;Games;Dynamic scheduling;Security;Pricing","","","","","","","IEEE","29 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In this paper, we proposed the traffic signal control mechanism based on a consortium blockchain, which has saved plenty of financial and material resources. It has solved the centralization problems and minimized the high degree of human intervention in the process of traffic signal light management. As a road is congested, the vehicle forwards road condition messages. The traffic department (TD) adjusts the signal light duration to allow the synergistic optimization management, and control the traffic vehicle status through a smart contract. In addition, we propose a credibility mechanism to effectively prevent vehicles from broadcasting mendacious messages and malicious requests, thereby enhancing the credibility of vehicles and providing a secure and trustworthy communication environment for the VANETs. It is hazardous for vehicles to send plaintext messages in an open environment because their privacy and security are threatened. Thus, we utilize ElGamal encryption and group signature algorithm to guarantee the confidentiality, privacy, and non-repudiation of any information.

However, it is easy to cause some security problems in the process of medical data sharing. Generally, after a patient's EHRs are generated by different medical institutions, they are outsourced to the cloud server (CS) by the authorized medical institutions for storage, which causes the patient to lose control of EHRs. Moreover, malicious medical institutions and semi-trusted cloud servers may collude to tamper with EHRs to seek benefits, which threatens the integrity of EHRs. Therefore, we propose a blockchain-assisted verifiable outsourced attribute-based signcryption scheme (BVOABSC) which realizes the secure sharing of EHRs in a multi-authority cloud storge environment. Firstly, we use the attribute-based signcryption algorithm to realize the confidentiality and unforgeability of the EHRs and protect the privacy of the signer. Secondly, it greatly reduces the computational burden of users by using verifiable outsourcing computation mechanism. Most of the designcryption calculation is performed by the cloud server, and the correctness of the generated partial designcryption ciphertext is verified by users. Furthermore, we use blockchain technology to protect outsourced EHRs from tampering by illegal users. Specifically, each operation on outsourced EHRs is stored as a transaction on the public blockchain, which ensures that EHRs cannot be modified. At the same time, the auditor can verify the integrity of the outsourced EHRs by checking the corresponding transactions. In addition, the smart contract created by the patient can solve the problems in cloud storage, such as tampering EHRs and returning incorrect results. Finally, security analysis and performance evaluation show that the proposed BVOABSC scheme satisfies stronger security and higher efficiency than similar schemes.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3025060","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61662069,61562077); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2017M610817); Science and Technology Project of Lanzhou City of China(grant numbers:2013-4-22); Foundation for Excellent Young Teachers by Northwest Normal University(grant numbers:NWNU-LKQN-14-7); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9200491","Attribute-based signcryption;blockchain;cloud storage;electronic health records;verifiable outsourced calculation","Cloud computing;Medical diagnostic imaging;Data privacy;Medical services;Servers","authorisation;cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;digital signatures;medical information systems;outsourcing;trusted computing","blockchain-assisted verifiable outsourced attribute-based signcryption scheme;medical data sharing;patient;medical institutions;cloud server;authorized medical institutions;malicious medical institutions;semitrusted cloud servers;multiauthority cloud storge environment;attribute-based signcryption algorithm;verifiable outsourcing computation mechanism;outsourced EHR;returning incorrect results;EHR sharing;BVOABSC","","1","","62","CCBY","18 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In spite of their utility in increasing provider efficiency and decreasing administrative costs, one challenge that has persisted is the data owners inability to control data after transmission. The lack of technical mechanisms to effectively control patients' health data in the network significantly affects participation of health and medical institutions while perpetrating the silo-based data management that locks value and potential inherent in the data. This not only affects researchers due to the lack of data for research and analysis but the quality of life of patients.We present a blockchain-supported architectural framework for secure control of personal data in a health information exchange by pairing user-generated acceptable use policies with smart contracts. We highlight the merits of our system, its user-centric focus and also show experimental results along with directions for extending our work. The framework introduces minimal risk to data by architecting a mechanism for controlling data after sharing. In adopting our framework, health service providers can deliver a stronger assurance for data management than is possible with current systems.","","978-1-5386-4294-8","10.1109/HealthCom.2018.8531160","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8531160","Blockchain;Health Information Exchange;Data Control;Data protection;Privacy","Information exchange;Electronic mail;Medical services;Monitoring;Computer science","health care;medical information systems;patient care;security of data;software architecture","silo-based data management;blockchain-supported architectural framework;secure control;personal data;health information exchange;user-generated acceptable use policies;health service providers;blockchain-based architecture framework;secure sharing;personal health data;medical institutions;data owners","","11","","33","","11 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consensus is agreed on data that is generated by the application and transmitted by the system's (peer-to-peer) network layer. While many attacks on the network layer were discussed so far, there is no systematic approach that brings together known attacks, the requirements, and the design space of the network layer. In this paper, we survey attacks on the network layer of permissionless blockchains, and derive five requirements: 1) performance; 2) low cost of participation; 3) anonymity; 4) DoS resistance; and 5) topology hiding. Furthermore, we survey the design space of the network layer and qualitatively show the effect of each design decisions on the fulfillment of the requirements. Finally, we pick two aspects of the design space, in-band peer discovery and relay delay, and demonstrate possible directions of future research by quantitatively analyzing and optimizing simplified scenarios. We show that while most design decisions imply certain tradeoffs, there is a lack of models that analyze and formalize these tradeoffs. Such models could aid the design of the network layer of permissionless blockchains. One reason for the lack of models is the deliberately limited observability of deployed blockchains. We emphasize that simulation based approaches cope with these limitations and are suited for the analysis of the network layer of permissionless blockchains.","1553-877X","","10.1109/COMST.2018.2852480","Bundesministerium für Wissenschaft und Forschung; Ministerium für Wissenschaft, Forschung und Kunst Baden-Württemberg; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8456488","Network security;peer-to-peer network;permissionless blockchain;anonymity","Network topology;Bitcoin;Peer-to-peer computing;Resistance;Bandwidth","cryptography;data encapsulation;distributed databases;peer-to-peer computing;trusted computing","permissionless blockchains;design space;design decisions;network layer aspects;peer-to-peer network layer;anonymity;DoS resistance;topology hiding","","23","","83","CCBY","6 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we proposed a blockchain-based decentralized authentication modeling scheme (named BlockAuth) in edge and IoT environment to provide a more secure, reliable, and strong fault tolerance novel solution, in which each edge device is regarded as a node to form a blockchain network.

The framework is built on a tiered blockchain architecture, along with InterPlanetary File System for IoT data storage and transfer. The goal is to enable IoT data users to exercise fine-grained control on how much data they share with entities authenticated through blockchains. To highlight how the framework would be used in real-life scenarios, this paper presents two use cases, namely an IoT data marketplace and a decentralized connected vehicle insurance. These examples showcase how the proposed framework can be used for varying smart contract-based applications involving exchanges of IoT data and cryptocurrency. Following the discussion about the use cases, the paper outlines a detailed security analysis performed on the proposed framework, based on multiple attack scenarios.

Nowadays, human factors are involved in Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) and this arises to the vehicular social networks (VSNs) that promote the prosperity of VANETs and lay a solid foundation for the development of vehicular based services. With the development of fast and reliable vehicular communication techniques and various user-centric applications, VSNs are likely to pave the way for sustainable development by promoting transportation efficiency. However, the flourish of VSNs is still somehow plagued by security issues. For instance, emerging data-intensive applications such as insurance premium assessment always rely on the analysis and mining of the large-scale VSNs data. Therefore, the users’ data security and privacy become one of the most concerned issues. More examples of real threats are easy to find. If the traffic related messages are not authenticated and integrity-protected in VSNs, a single bogus and/or malicious message can potentially incur a terrible traffic accident. Thus, the real deployment of VSNs acquires appropriate security and privacy protection against the holistic environment. To meet such security and privacy requirements, a just recently proposed technique named blockchain should be significantly considered. Blockchain, widely known as one of the disruptive technologies, can provide technical support for VSNs in terms of big data management and security. Firstly, blockchain can create a ledger for VSNs, which records all data and behaviours occurring in VSNs, and coordinates all events that occurred and will happen. Once the data is uploaded to blockchain as a ledger, it is computational impossible for tampering. Secondly, blockchain can be further used to address security issues related to VSNs, such as the safety of connection and communication between intelligent vehicles. Meanwhile, the decentralized consensus mechanism will effectively strengthen the security of the system. By integrating with the smart contract, the blockchain can turn every vehicle into an independent network node, which can self-maintain and adjust. Versatile novel security properties can be offered by blockchain. Hence, it is urgent to explore the latest understanding and advances in the blockchain based techniques in VSNs.
