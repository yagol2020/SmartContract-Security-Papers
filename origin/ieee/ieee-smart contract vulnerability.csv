Researchers have proposed many approaches to detecting them. However, empirical studies have shown that these approaches suffer from undesirable false positives and false negatives, when the code under detection involves the interaction between multiple smart contracts. In this paper, we propose an accurate and efficient cross-contract reentrancy detection approach in practice. Rather than design rule-of-thumb heuristics, we conduct a large empirical study of 11714 real-world contracts from Etherscan against three well-known general-purpose security tools for reentrancy detection. We manually summarized the reentrancy scenarios where the state-of-the-art approaches cannot address. Based on the empirical evidence, we present Clairvoyance, a cross-function and cross-contract static analysis to detect reentrancy vulnerabilities in real world with significantly higher accuracy. To reduce false negatives, we enable, for the first time, a cross-contract call chain analysis by tracking possibly tainted paths. To reduce false positives, we systematically summarized five major path protective techniques (PPTs) to support fast yet precise path feasibility checking.

Mutation testing is a fault-based testing method that can effectively improve the sufficiency of a test for smart contracts. However, existing methods cannot efficiently perform mutation testing specifically for integer overflow in ESCs. Therefore, by analyzing integer overflow in ESCs, we propose five special mutation operators to address such vulnerability in terms of detecting sufficiency in ESC testing. An empirical study on 40 open-source ESCs is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mutation operators. Results show that: (1) our proposed mutation operators can reproduce all 179 integer overflow vulnerabilities in 40 smart contracts, and the generated mutants have high compilation pass rate and integer overflow vulnerability generation rate; moreover, (2) the generated mutants can find the shortcomings of existing testing methods for integer overflow vulnerability, thereby providing effective support to improve the sufficiency of the test.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2020.9010036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9515698","blockchain;Ethereum Smart Contracts (ESCs);integer overflow;mutation testing","Smart contracts;Testing;Contracts;Blockchains;Security;Tools;Sun","blockchains;contracts;program debugging;program diagnostics;program testing;public domain software","mutation testing;fault-based testing;mutation operators;ESC testing;smart contracts;open-source ESC;Ethereum smart contract testing;integer overflow vulnerability generation rate","","","","","","17 Aug 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

However, many identified bugs and vulnerabilities in smart contracts have led to serious financial losses, which raises serious concerns about smart contract security. Thus, there is a significant need to better maintain smart contract code and ensure its high reliability. In this research: (1) Firstly, we propose an automated deep learning based approach to learn structural code embeddings of smart contracts in Solidity, which is useful for clone detection, bug detection and contract validation on smart contracts. We apply our approach to more than 22K solidity contracts collected from the Ethereum blockchain, results show that the clone ratio of solidity code is at around 90%, much higher than traditional software. We collect a list of 52 known buggy smart contracts belonging to 10 kinds of common vulnerabilities as our bug database. Our approach can identify more than 1000 clone related bugs based on our bug databases efficiently and accurately. (2) Secondly, according to developers' feedback, we have implemented the approach in a web-based tool, named Smartembed, to facilitate Solidity developers for using our approach. Our tool can assist Solidity developers to efficiently identify repetitive smart contracts in the existing Ethereum blockchain, as well as checking their contract against a known set of bugs. which can help to improve the users' confidence in the reliability of the contract. We optimize the implementations of Smartembed which is sufficient in supporting developers in real-time for practical uses. The Ethereum ecosystem as well as the individual Solidity developer can both benefit from our research.","2643-1572","978-1-4503-6768-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9285659","deep learning;smart contract;clone detection;bug detection;code embedding","Deep learning;Databases;Smart contracts;Computer bugs;Cloning;Tools;Reliability","blockchains;contracts;deep learning (artificial intelligence);financial data processing;program debugging;software maintenance","business transactions;serious financial losses;smart contract security;automated deep learning;solidity code;buggy smart contracts;bug database;Solidity developers;Ethereum blockchain;clone related bugs;blockchain-based financial transaction;Smartembed;smart contract code maintenance","","","","30","","24 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The automatic detection of smart contract vulnerabilities therefore is an essential research problem. Existing solutions to this problem particularly rely on human experts to define features or different rules to detect vulnerabilities. However, this often causes many vulnerabilities to be ignored, and they are inefficient in detecting new vulnerabilities. In this study, to overcome such challenges, we propose the VSCL framework to automatically detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts on the blockchain. More specifically, first, we utilize novel feature vector generation techniques from bytecode of smart contract since the source code of smart contracts are rarely available in public. Next, the collected vectors are fed into our novel metric learning-based deep neural network(DNN) to get the detection result. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a large-scale benchmark, and the quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.","","978-1-6654-3578-9","10.1109/ICBC51069.2021.9461050","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9461050","Smart Contract;Vulnerability Detection;Metric Learning;Blockchain","Measurement;Deep learning;Conferences;Smart contracts;Blockchain;Benchmark testing;Feature extraction","blockchains;contracts;cryptocurrencies;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction","vulnerability detection automation;deep learning;blockchain technology;cryptocurrencies;smart contract vulnerability automatic detection;VSCL framework;feature vector generation techniques;smart contract bytecode;source code;metric learning-based deep neural network;DNN","","","","30","","24 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Drought-based crop insurance has launched in some SEA countries to protect farmers from extreme weather events. The evaluation process for insurance value coverage is costly and lengthy. Farmer participation in crop insurance schemes, hence, remains low. Additionally, while dealing with extreme events, stated-owned irrigation water companies with complex bureaucratic systems delay decisions. This adds a heavy toll on farmers' shoulders when facing drought. To solve these problems, a blockchain-based smart contract linking with oracle services to ensure asymmetric information is proposed to reduce the evaluation costs and lengthy process of evaluating compensation is a. Currently, building smart contract that oracles can push required information to is not used in the case of agricultural insurance. Hence, we proposed a blockchain-based smart contract framework that applies to weather-based index insurance. We selected NEO for our experiment due to its easy access tokens. While developing a smart contract on NEO, we designed 5 functions that can be triggered if certain conditions are met and built a virtual oracles server.

Existing efforts for contract security analysis heavily rely on rigid rules defined by experts, which is labor-intensive and non-scalable. More importantly, expert-defined rules tend to be error-prone and suffer the inherent risk of being cheated by crafty attackers. Recent researches focus on the symbolic execution and formal analysis of smart contract for vulnerability detection, yet to achieve a precise and scalable solution. Although several methods have been proposed to detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts, there is still a lack of effort that considers combining expert-defined security patterns with deep neural networks. In this paper, we explore using graph neural networks and expert knowledge for smart contract vulnerability detection. Specifically, we cast the rich control- and data- flow semantics of the source code into a contract graph. Then, we propose a novel temporal message propagation network to extract graph feature from the normalized graph, and combine the graph feature with expert patterns to yield a final detection system.

The smart contract is an executable program that can be used for automatic transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. In 2016, the DAO attack resulted in the theft of 60M USD due to unsafe smart contracts. Smart contracts are vulnerable to hacking because they are difficult to patch and there is a lack of assessment standards for ensuring their quality. Hackers can exploit the vulnerabilities in smart contracts when they have been published on Ethereum. Thus, this study presents SoliAudit (Solidity Audit), which uses machine learning and fuzz testing for smart contract vulnerability assessment. SoliAudit employs machine learning technology using Solidity machine code as learning features to verify 13 kinds of vulnerabilities, which have been listed as Top 10 threats by an open security organization. We also created a gray-box fuzz testing mechanism, which consists of a fuzzer contract and a simulated blockchain environment for on-line transaction verification. Different from previous research systems, SoliAudit can detect vulnerabilities without expert knowledge or predefined patterns. We subjected SoliAudit to real-world evaluation by using near 18k smart contracts from the Ethereum blockchain and Capture-the-Flag samples. The results show that the accuracy of SoliAudit can reach to 90% and the fuzzing can help identify potential weaknesses, including reentrancy and arithmetic overflow problems.","","978-1-7281-2949-5","10.1109/IOTSMS48152.2019.8939256","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8939256","Smart contract;vulnerability;fuzz testing;machine learning","Smart contracts;Blockchain;Machine learning;Feature extraction;Security;Fuzzing","computer crime;contracts;cryptography;learning (artificial intelligence);program testing","SoliAudit;smart contract vulnerability assessment;machine learning;Ethereum blockchain;unsafe smart contracts;fuzzer contract;decentralized system architecture;user-defined logical concept;DAO attack;solidity audit;Solidity machine code;open security organization;gray-box fuzz testing mechanism;online transaction verification;hacking","","2","","28","","23 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Though most of the interest is generated by cryptocurrency related activities, it is becoming apparent that a much wider spectrum of applications can leverage the blockchain technology. The primary concepts enabling such general use of the blockchain are the so-called smart contracts, which are special programs that run on the blockchain. One of the most popular blockchain platforms that supports smart contracts are Ethereum. As smart contracts typically handle money, ensuring their low number of faults and vulnerabilities are essential. To aid smart contract developers and help maturing the technology, we need analysis tools and studies for smart contracts. As an initiative for this, we propose the adoption of some well-known OO metrics for Solidity smart contracts. Furthermore, we analyze more than 10,000 smart contracts with our prototype tool. The results suggest that smart contract programs are short, not overly complex and either quite well-commented or not commented at all.

Many techniques based on symbolic execution, fuzzing, and static analysis are used to detect contract vulnerabilities. Most of the current analyzers only consider vulnerability detection intra-contract scenarios. However, Ethereum contracts usually interact with others by calling their functions. A bug hidden in a path that depends on information from external contract calls is defined as an inter-contract vulnerability. Failure to deal with this kind of bug can result in potential false negatives and false positives. In this work, we propose Pluto, which supports vulnerability detection in inter-contract scenarios. It first builds an Inter-contract Control Flow Graph (ICFG) to extract semantic information among contract calls. Afterward, it symbolically explores the ICFG and deduces Inter-Contract Path Constraints (ICPC) to check the reachability of execution paths more accurately. Finally, Pluto detects whether there is a vulnerability based on some predefined rules. For evaluation, we compare Pluto with five state-of-the-art tools, including Oyente, Mythril, Securify, ILF, and Clairvoyance on a labeled benchmark and 39,443 real-world Ethereum smart contracts. The result shows that other tools can only detect 10% of the inter-contract vulnerabilities, while Pluto can detect 80% of them on the labeled dataset. Beyond that, Pluto has detected 451 confirmed vulnerabilities on real-world contracts, including 36 vulnerabilities in inter-contract scenarios. Two bugs have been assigned with unique CVE identifiers by the US National Vulnerability Database (NVD). On average, Pluto costs 16.9 seconds to analyze a contract, which is as fast as the state-of-the-art tools.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2021.3117966","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9562567","Smart Contracts;Ethereum;Inter-Contract Vulnerabilities","Pluto;Tools;Smart contracts;Semantics;Computer bugs;Codes;Virtual machining","","","","","","","IEEE","7 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

A smart contract acts in a similar way to a traditional agreement but negates the necessity for the involvement of a third party. Smart contracts are capable of initiating their commands automatically, thus eliminating the involvement of a regulatory body. As a consequence of blockchain's immutable feature, smart contracts are developed in a manner that is distinct from traditional software. Once deployed to the blockchain, a smart contract cannot be modified or updated for security patches, thus encouraging developers to implement strong security strategies before deployment in order to avoid potential exploitation at a later time. However, the most recent dreadful attacks and the multifarious existing vulnerabilities which result as a consequence of the absence of security patches have challenged the sustainability of this technology. Attacks such as the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) attack and the Parity Wallet hack have cost millions of dollars simply as a consequence of naïve bugs in the smart contract code. In this paper, we classify blockchain exploitation techniques into 4 categories based on the attack rationale; attacking consensus protocols, bugs in the smart contract, malware running in the operating system, and fraudulent users. We then focus on smart contract vulnerabilities, analyzing the 7 most important attack techniques to determine the real impact on smart contract technology. We reveal that even adopting the 10 most widely used tools to detect smart contract vulnerabilities, these still contain known vulnerabilities, providing a dangerously false sense of security. We conclude the paper with a discussion about recommendations and future research lines to progress towards a secure smart contract solution.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2970495","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8976179","Smart contracts;attack techniques;DApp;Ethereum;vulnerability","Smart contracts;Blockchain;Bitcoin;Computer bugs","contracts;cryptography;distributed databases;invasive software;program debugging","smart contract code;smart contract vulnerabilities;smart contract technology;secure smart contract solution;decentralized blockchains;security patches;decentralized autonomous organization attack;DAO attack;Parity Wallet hack;naïve bugs;malware","","10","","75","CCBY","30 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Ethereum is one of the major platforms used for smart contracts, where solidity basically is a high-level programming language used in the Ethereum to build smart contracts. Recent vulnerabilities found by the coders were not updated in analysis tool (SmartCheck) and therefore incapable of detecting vulnerabilities. No definitions of patterns were existing to detect these vulnerabilities. This paper focuses on the improvement of the Smartcheck analysis method to convert the source code of solidity into an intermediate representation based on XML and verifies this against the XPath patterns.

In this paper a smart contract bytecode defect detection algorithm based on parallel symbolic execution is proposed. We split a smart contract in units of functions by analyzing the smart contract function selection process. A symbolic execution tree is constructed for each function to predict the function execution path. Then we partition the symbolic execution tree into multiple sub-trees evenly. Finally, a process pool is used to perform parallel symbolic execution on those sub-trees to reduce the analysis time of smart contract defect detection. Experimental data shows our method has a significant improvement in detection efficiency compared with existing symbolic execution method. The speedup ratio is up to 3.1x in a 4-core computer.

As a result, the smart grid inherits most of the security vulnerabilities of cyber systems, putting the smart grid at risk of cyber-attacks. To secure the communication between smart grid entities, namely the smart meters and the utility, we propose in this paper a communication infrastructure built on top of a blockchain network, specifically Ethereum. All two-way communication between the smart meters and the utility is assumed to be transactions governed by smart contracts. Smart contracts are designed in such a way to ensure that each smart meter is authentic and each smart meter reading is reported securely and privately.

Since current symbol execution tools often fall into path explosion and thus lead to inefficient detection, this paper expands Mythril's framework to optimize its performance. Firstly, it finds out potential vulnerable code regions using static analysis and identifies critical paths that may have security defects. Then, aiming at the problem that traditional search algorithms cannot actively locate and explore critical paths, this paper presents a multi-objective oriented path search (MOPS) strategy based on path priority. This strategy guides dynamic symbolic execution to cover critical paths quickly, avoiding blind traversal of program execution paths. Finally, it describes security rules and proposes corresponding detection logics for different vulnerability categories. This paper analyzes over 1000 smart contracts extracted from Etherscan. Compared with existing tools based on symbolic execution, the proposed method can reduce time consumption by around 35% while ensuring the accuracy of vulnerability detection. Moreover, existing tools often issue warnings that do not actually cause financial losses. But the proposed method only concentrates on code regions related to transfer of funds, so it can reduce the false alarm rate to some extent.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2947146","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2017YFB08029); Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications(grant numbers:NY219004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8867880","Block chain security;smart contract;vulnerability mining","Smart contracts;Security;Tools;Semantics;Blockchain;Explosions","contracts;cryptocurrencies;program diagnostics;program testing;search problems","detection logics;ecosystem security;frequent smart contract vulnerability incidents;critical-path-coverage-based vulnerability detection method;vulnerability categories;program execution paths;dynamic symbolic execution;path priority;multiobjective oriented path search strategy;traditional search algorithms;security defects;critical paths;potential vulnerable code regions;path explosion;current symbol execution tools","","1","","42","CCBY","14 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is thus an emerging yet crucial issue to effectively and efficiently detect vulnerabilities in contracts. Existing detection methods like Oyente and Securify are mainly based on symbolic execution or analysis. These methods are very time-consuming, as the symbolic execution requires the exploration of all executable paths or the analysis of dependency graphs in a contract.

Therefore, an assessment approach that allows developers to recognise the consequences of deploying vulnerable contracts is needed. In this paper, we propose a debt-aware approach for assessing security design vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Our assessment approach involves two main steps: (i) identification of design vulnerabilities using security analysis techniques and (ii) an estimation of the ramifications of the identified vulnerabilities leveraging the technical debt metaphor, its principal and interest. We use examples of vulnerable contracts to demonstrate the applicability of our approach. The results show that our assessment approach increases the visibility of security design issues. It also allows developers to concentrate on resolving smart contract vulnerabilities through technical debt impact analysis and prioritisation. Developers can use our approach to inform the design of more secure contracts and for reducing unintentional debts caused by a lack of awareness of security issues.","","978-1-6654-1405-0","10.1109/TechDebt52882.2021.00010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9463047","smart contract;technical debt;security","Visualization;Smart contracts;Estimation;Tools;Software;Security","contracts;security of data","security design vulnerabilities;security analysis techniques;identified vulnerabilities;technical debt metaphor;vulnerable contracts;security design issues;smart contract vulnerabilities;technical debt impact analysis;prioritisation;secure contracts;smart contracts security technical debts;deployed contracts;debt-aware approach","","","","47","","25 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There is a significant need to better assist developers in checking smart contracts and ensuring their reliability. In this paper, we propose a web service tool, named SmartEmbed, which can help Solidity developers to find repetitive contract code and clone-related bugs in smart contracts. Our tool is based on code embeddings and similarity checking techniques. By comparing the similarities among the code embedding vectors for existing solidity code in the Ethereum blockchain and known bugs, we are able to efficiently identify code clones and clone-related bugs for any solidity code given by users, which can help to improve the users' confidence in the reliability of their code. In addition to the uses by individual developers, SmartEmbed can also be applied to studies of smart contracts in a large scale. When applied to more than 22K solidity contracts collected from the Ethereum blockchain, we found that the clone ratio of solidity code is close to 90%, much higher than traditional software, and 194 clone-related bugs can be identified efficiently and accurately based on our small bug database with a precision of 96%.","2576-3148","978-1-7281-3094-1","10.1109/ICSME.2019.00067","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8919164","smart contract;clone detection;bug detection;ethereum;blockchain;code embedding","Contracts;Computer bugs;Cloning;Tools;Semantics","contracts;cryptocurrencies;financial data processing;security of data;software maintenance;software reliability;software tools;Web services","small bug database;user confidence;code embedding vectors;similarity checking techniques;clone-related bugs;Web service tool;reliability;structural code embeddings;bug detection;SmartEmbed;solidity contracts;code clones;Ethereum blockchain;solidity code;repetitive contract code;business transactions;smart contract security","","4","","9","","5 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Compared to traditional Software Engineering, a discipline of Smart Contract and Blockchain programming, with standardized best practices that can help solve the mentioned problems and conflicts, is not yet sufficiently developed. Furthermore, Smart Contracts rely on a non-standard software life-cycle, according to which, for instance, delivered applications can hardly be updated or bugs resolved by releasing a new version of the software. In this paper we advocate the need for a discipline of Blockchain Software Engineering, addressing the issues posed by smart contract programming and other applications running on blockchains.We analyse a case of study where a bug discovered in a Smart Contract library, and perhaps ""unsafe"" programming, allowed an attack on Parity, a wallet application, causing the freezing of about 500K Ethers (about 150M USD, in November 2017).

To mitigate this problem, we propose Aroc, a general repairer that can automatically patch vulnerable deployed smart contracts. The core insight of Aroc is to generate a patch contract leveraging static analysis techniques to verify whether transactions obey secure states of the vulnerable contracts, and then abort those deviated transactions in advance. Take the three most serious bug types (i.e., reentrancy, arithmetic bugs, and unchecked low-level checks) as examples, we present how Aroc is able to automatically repairs them on chain. Experimental results show that Aroc can automatically repair 84.95% of the vulnerable contracts with an average correctness ratio of 91.43%. Meanwhile, Aroc introduces acceptable additional overheads to smart contract users and blockchain miners.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2021.3123170","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9591399","Smart contract;vulnerability;repair;on-chain protection","Contracts;Smart contracts;Codes;Blockchains;Computer bugs;Maintenance engineering;Task analysis","","","","","","","CCBYNCND","27 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

It inherently relies on gas consumption within a specified allowance to constrain code execution, making every instruction along an execution path to be a location for raising an exception. In this paper, we present GasFuzzer, the first work in exploring the effects of gas allowance manipulation to expose gas-oriented exception security vulnerabilities. GasFuzzer consists of two phases. The first phase introduces a gas-greedy strategy to favor transactions having higher gas consumption for mutation to obtain test transactions with different gas consumptions. The second phase introduces a novel notion of fractional gas consumption coverage and a novel gas-leveling strategy. It applies them to mutate the gas allowances of some of these transactions resulting in the highest gas consumptions produced in the first phase followed by applying these allowance-mutated transactions together with those which remained non-mutated to fuzz test the smart contract. We report an evaluation of GasFuzzer via an experiment on 3170 real-world smart contracts deployed on the public Ethereum Blockchain between October 2017 and July 2019. The findings show that GasFuzzer with gas-greedy strategy can detect more Exceptions Disorder kind of security vulnerabilities (7 more cases) than the previous state-of-the-art black-box fuzzer, and GasFuzzer with gas-leveling strategy and gas coverage criterion can detect 6 additional cases of Exceptions Disorder security vulnerabilities, which is significant.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2995183","GRF of Hong Kong Research Grants Council(grant numbers:11214116,11200015); NSFC of China(grant numbers:61772056,61690202); External Grant(grant numbers:61400020404); HKSAR ITF(grant numbers:ITS/378/18); CityU MF_EXT(grant numbers:9678180); CityU SRG(grant numbers:7004882,7005216,7005122); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9094680","Blockchain;Ethereum;smart contract;fuzzing;software testing;Fuzzer;security vulnerability;gas consumption;atomicity violation;vulnerability triggering","Fuzzing;Licenses;Virtual machining;Computer science","contracts;cryptography;program testing","gas allowance manipulation;gas-oriented exception security vulnerabilities;Fuzzing Ethereum smart contract binaries;gas coverage criterion;public Ethereum Blockchain;real-world smart contracts;allowance-mutated transactions;gas-leveling strategy;fractional gas consumption coverage;gas-greedy strategy;GasFuzzer","","2","","28","CCBY","18 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we explore the security aspects of decentralized applications and, in particular, the security of smart contracts. Distributed ledger characteristics impose distinct requirements on smart contract design, implementation, deployment, and management. We briefly present the approach to the development of secure smart contracts, and highlight key smart contract vulnerabilities and the developer tools supporting smart contract security. We developed a secure, upgradeable modular multi-contract platform. It combines per-contract Smart Contract Tunnels and per-user-based access control to minimize vulnerabilities. The smart contract platform is comprised of service-agnostic, auxiliary, and service-specific smart contracts. It can be therefore easily adapted to different 5G application verticals. For illustration and evaluation, we elaborated on the proposed solution on a case of smart electric charging. During the design and development, state-of-the-art code analysis was applied.

This technology enables consumers to make agreements in a transparent and conflict-free environment. However, the security vulnerabilities within these smart contracts are a potential threat to the applications and their consumers and have shown in the past to cause huge financial losses. In this paper, we propose a framework that combines static and dynamic analysis to detect Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability due to an unexpected revert in Ethereum Smart Contracts. Our framework, SmartScan, statically scans smart contracts under test (SCUTs) to identify patterns that are potentially vulnerable in these SCUTs and then uses dynamic analysis to precisely confirm their exploitability of the DoS-Unexpected Revert vulnerability, thus achieving increased performance and more precise results. We evaluated SmartScan on a set of 500 smart contracts collected from the Etherscan.

The smart contracts can facilitate, verify, and implement the negotiation between multiple parties, also guaranteeing transactions without a traditional legal entity. Many tools supporting the smart contracts development in different areas are flourishing because in Ethereum blockchain valuable assets are often involved. Some of the tools help the developer to find security vulnerabilities via static and/or dynamic analysis or to reduce the Gas fees consumption. Despite the plethora of such tools, there is no tool supporting smart contracts evaluation and analysis via a graphical representation for expert developers. The paper embraces this way to facilitate the developers' analysis activity, by proposing a graphical representation model to visualize smart contract source code. The paper makes available a tool via a web interface, which accepts the smart contract address as an input and produces a graphical representation of the smart contract as an output. The graphical representation can help developers to better understand the structure of smart contracts and share it with other developers. Moreover, some metrics, such as the relations among smart contracts, are easier to be understood via ""spatial"" than ""tabular"" representation. Indeed, representing smart contracts' metrics via visual representation facilitates the developers, who are used to analyse the source code by directly inspecting it or using other tools that provide the metrics in a table format. Finally, the paper provides detailed data regarding a smart contract to the developers and proposes a graphical representation of the smart contracts without obscuration of details, also highlighting areas of the code that are possibly too big in size and/or too complex via a diagram displaying their connections.","1534-5351","978-1-7281-9630-5","10.1109/SANER50967.2021.00090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9425959","Smart contract;Ethereum blockchain;visual analysis;class diagram","Measurement;Visualization;Law;Conferences;Smart contracts;Unified modeling language;Blockchain","blockchains;Internet","smart contract address;graphical representation;smart contracts development;smart contracts evaluation;smart contract source code;Ethereum blockchain;visual representation","","","","38","","11 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It then monitors the executions of target contract programs, and validates the results against a general-purpose semantic test oracle to discover vulnerabilities. Being a dynamic technique, it guarantees that each discovered vulnerability is a violation of the test oracle and is able to generate the attack script to exploit this vulnerability. In contrast to rule-based approaches, ContraMaster has not shown any false positives, and it easily generalizes to unknown types of vulnerabilities (e.g., logic errors).

Matching-based detection methods extrapolating known vulnerabilities to unknown have proven to be effective in other platforms. However, directly adopting the technique to smart contracts is obstructed by two issues, i.e., diversity of bytecode generation resulting from the rapid evolution of compilers and interference of noise code easily caused by the homogeneous business logics. To address the problems, we propose contract bytecode-oriented normalization and slicing techniques to augment bytecode matching. Specifically, we conduct data- and instruction-level normalizations to uniform the bytecode generated by different compilers, and enforce contract-specific slicing by tracking data- and control-flows with simulated bytecode executions to prune the noise code as far as possible. Based on the above techniques, we design an unsupervised graph embedding algorithm to encode the code graphs into quantitatively comparable vectors. The potentially vulnerable smart contracts can be identified by measuring the similarities between their vectors and known vulnerable ones. Our evaluations have shown the efficiency (0.47 seconds per contract on average), effectiveness (160 verified true positives) and high precision (91.95% for top-ranked). It is worth noting that, we also identify dozens of honeypot contracts, further demonstrating the capability of our method.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2021.3050051","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:U1836209,61802413); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Research Funds of Renmin University of China(grant numbers:19XNLG02,20XNLG03); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9316905","Vulnerable smart contracts;graph embedding;bytecode matching","Smart contracts;Task analysis;Interference;Blockchain;Prototypes;Business;Virtual machining","contracts;graph theory;pattern matching;program compilers;security of data;software maintenance;unsupervised learning","matching-based detection methods;resultant financial losses;smart contract vulnerabilities;graph embedding;honeypot contracts;potentially vulnerable smart contracts;unsupervised graph;simulated bytecode executions;contract-specific slicing;instruction-level normalizations;bytecode matching;slicing techniques;homogeneous business logics;noise code;bytecode generation","","","","48","IEEE","8 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This classification is a source of reminding developers and software engineers that for SC's safety, each SC requires proper testing with effective tools to catch those classes' vulnerabilities.","","978-1-7281-6251-5","10.1109/BigData50022.2020.9439088","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9439088","Smart Contract;Ethereum;EVM;vulnerabilities;Solidity;tools","Conferences;Smart contracts;Blockchain;Big Data;Tools;Software;Safety","blockchains;computer crime;contracts;cryptocurrencies;software engineering","crypto-currencies;electronic transactions;SC account holders;Ethereum smart contracts;BlockChain technology;solidity-based SC;SC vulnerability classification;Ethereum BlockChain","","","","57","","24 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These decentralized applications are frequently built on multiple interacting contracts. While the underlying platform ensures the correctness of smart contract execution, today developers continue struggling to create functionally correct contracts, as evidenced by a number of security incidents in the recent past. Even though these incidents often exploit contract interaction, prior work on smart contract verification, vulnerability discovery, and secure development typically considers only individual contracts. This paper proposes an approach for the correct-by-design development and deployment of multiple interacting smart contracts by introducing a graphical notation (called deployment diagrams) for specifying possible interactions between contract types. Based on this notation, it later presents a framework for the automated verification, generation, and deployment of interacting contracts that conform to a deployment diagram. As an added benefit, the proposed framework provides a clear separation of concerns between the internal contract behavior and contract interaction, which allows one to compositionally model and analyze systems of interacting smart contracts efficiently.","","978-1-7281-6680-3","10.1109/ICBC48266.2020.9169428","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9169428","Smart Contract;Verification;CAD;Solidity;Ethereum","Contracts;Solid modeling;Tools;Computational modeling;Analytical models","contracts;formal specification;formal verification;object-oriented programming;security of data;Unified Modeling Language","smart contract verification;secure development;individual contracts;correct-by-design development;multiple interacting smart contracts;deployment diagram;contract types;internal contract behavior;functionally correct contracts;smart contract execution;multiple interacting contracts;decentralized applications;verified development;contract interaction","","2","","36","","17 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The characteristics of blockchain such as immutability and openness, however, have made DApps more vulnerable to various security risks, and thus it has become of great significance to validate the integrity of DApps before they actually operate upon blockchain. Recently, research on vulnerability in smart contracts (a building block of DApps) has been actively conducted, and various vulnerabilities and their countermeasures were reported. However, the effectiveness of such countermeasures has not been studied well, and no appropriate methods have been proposed to evaluate them. In this paper, we propose a software tool that can easily perform comparative studies by adding existing/new countermeasures and labeled smart contract codes. The proposed tool demonstrates verification performance using various statistical indicators, which helps to identify the most effective countermeasures for each type of vulnerability. Using the proposed tool, we evaluated state-of-the-art countermeasures with 237 labeled benchmark codes. The results indicate that for certain types of vulnerabilities, some countermeasures show evenly good performance scores on various metrics. However, it is also observed that countermeasures that detect the largest number of vulnerable codes typically generate much more false positives, resulting in very low precision and accuracy. Consequently, under given constraints, different countermeasures may be recommended for detecting vulnerabilities of interest. We believe that the proposed tool could effectively be utilized for a future verification study of smart contract applications and contribute to the development of practical and secure smart contract applications.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3091317","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT)(grant numbers:2019R1F1A1063272,2020R1F1A1048395,2020R1A4A3079947); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9461797","Blockchain;countermeasure;Ethereum;smart contract;vulnerability","Smart contracts;Blockchain;Tools;Bitcoin;Benchmark testing;Software tools;Licenses","blockchains;contracts;software tools;statistical analysis","stastical indicators;secure Ethereum smart contract applications;labeled benchmark codes;software tool;digital security;blockchain technology;smart contract codes;DApps;reliable decentralized applications","","","","44","CCBYNCND","21 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

At the same time, it also attracts the attentions of attackers. Fake deposit, as one of the most representative attacks (vulnerabilities) related to exchanges and tokens, has been frequently observed in the blockchain ecosystem, causing large financial losses. However, besides a few security reports, our community lacks the understanding of this vulnerability, for example its scale and the impacts. In this paper, we take the first step to demystify the fake deposit vulnerability. Based on the essential patterns we have summarized, we implement DEPOSafe, an automated tool to detect and verify (exploit) the fake deposit vulnerability in ERC-20 smart contracts. DEPOSafe incorporates several key techniques including symbolic execution based static analysis and behavior modeling based dynamic verification. By applying DEPOSafe to 176,000 ERC-20 smart contracts, we have identified over 7,000 vulnerable contracts that may suffer from two types of attacks.

Solidity is the most mature high-level smart contract language. Ethereum is a hostile execution environment, where anonymous attackers exploit bugs for immediate financial gain. Developers have a very limited ability to patch deployed contracts. Hackers steal up to tens of millions of dollars from flawed contracts, a well-known example being ""The DAO"", broken in June 2016. Advice on secure Ethereum programming practices is spread out across blogs, papers, and tutorials. Many sources are outdated due to a rapid pace of development in this field. Automated vulnerability detection tools, which help detect potentially problematic language constructs, are still underdeveloped in this area. We provide a comprehensive classification of code issues in Solidity and implement SmartCheck - an extensible static analysis tool that detects them. SmartCheck translates Solidity source code into an XML-based intermediate representation and checks it against XPath patterns. We evaluated our tool on a big dataset of real-world contracts and compared the results with manual audit on three contracts. Our tool reflects the current state of knowledge on Solidity vulnerabilities and shows significant improvements over alternatives. SmartCheck has its limitations, as detection of some bugs requires more sophisticated techniques such as taint analysis or even manual audit. We believe though that a static analyzer should be an essential part of contract developers' toolbox, letting them fix simple bugs fast and allocate more effort to complex issues.","","978-1-4503-5726-5","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8445052","Ethereum;Solidity;smart contracts;static analysis;bug detection","Contracts;Static analysis;Tools;Computer bugs;Computer hacking","contracts;program debugging;program diagnostics;security of data;source code (software);XML","SmartCheck;Ethereum smart contracts;blockchain-based platform;decentralized network;high-level smart contract language;hostile execution environment;anonymous attackers;bugs;patch deployed contracts;flawed contracts;secure Ethereum programming practices;automated vulnerability detection tools;extensible static analysis tool;Solidity source code;XML-based intermediate representation;real-world contracts;manual audit;shows significant improvements;taint analysis;static analyzer;contract developers;financial gain","","1","1","41","","26 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to better deal with such dilemma, making a comprehensive survey about the security verification of blockchain smart contracts from major scientific databases is quite indispensable.

A countermeasure to such attacks is based on dynamic analysis that executes the smart contracts themselves, but it requires the spending of Ether and knowledge of attack patterns for analysis in advance. In this paper, we present a static analysis tool named RA (Re-entrancy Analyzer), a combination of symbolic execution and equivalence checking by a satisfiability modulo theories solver to analyze smart contract vulnerabilities against re-entrancy attacks. In contrast to existing tools, RA supports analysis of inter-contract behaviors by using only the Ethereum Virtual Machine bytecodes of target smart contracts, i.e., even without prior knowledge of attack patterns and without spending Ether. Furthermore, RA can verify existence of vulnerabilities against re-entrancy attacks without execution of smart contracts and it does not provide false positives and false negatives. We also present an implementation of RA to evaluate its performance in analyzing the vulnerability of deployed smart contracts against re-entrancy attacks and show that RA can precisely determine which smart contracts are vulnerable.","","978-0-7381-0495-9","10.1109/Blockchain50366.2020.00048","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9284679","Ethereum;smart contracts;static analysis;EVM;symbolic execution;SMT solver","Smart contracts;Static analysis;Blockchain;Tools;Virtual machining;Peer-to-peer computing;Flow graphs","blockchains;computability;Java;program diagnostics;program verification;virtual machines","RA;re-entrancy attacks;Ethereum smart contracts;consensus-based blockchain;peer-to-peer network;dynamic analysis tool;static analysis tool;smart contract vulnerabilities;inter-contract behaviors;ethereum virtual machine bytecode;re-entrancy analyzer","","","","28","","11 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such flexibility can lead to a large collection of similar contracts, i.e., clones, especially when Ethereum applications are highly domain-specific and may share similar functionalities within the same domain, e.g., token contracts often provide interfaces for money transfer and balance inquiry. While smart contract clones have a wide range of impact across different applications, e.g., security, they are relatively little studied. Although clone detection has been a long-standing research topic, blockchain smart contracts introduce new challenges, e.g., syntactic diversity due to trade-off between storage and execution, understanding high-level business logic etc.. In this paper, we highlighted the very first attempt to clone detection of Ethereum smart contracts. To overcome the new challenges, we introduce the concept of smart contract birthmark, i.e., a semantic-preserving and computable representation for smart contract bytecode. The birthmark captures high-level semantics by effectively sketching symbolic execution traces (e.g., data access dependencies, path conditions) and maintain syntactic regularities (e.g., type and number of instructions) as well. Then, the clone detection problem is reduced to a computation of statistical similarity between two contract birthmarks. We have implemented a clone detector called EClone and evaluated it on Ethereum. The empirical results demonstrated the potential of EClone in accurately identifying clones.

To understand the security level of smart contracts in the wild, we empirically studied 55,046 real-world Ethereum smart contracts written in Solidity, the most popular programming language used by Ethereum smart contract developers. We first examined how many well-known vulnerabilities the Solidity compiler has patched, and how frequently the Solidity team publishes compiler releases. Unfortunately, we observed that many known vulnerabilities are not yet patched, and some patches are not even sufficient to avoid their target vulnerabilities. Subsequently, we investigated whether smart contract developers use the most recent compiler with vulnerabilities patched. We reported that developers of more than 98% of real-world Solidity contracts still use older compilers without vulnerability patches, and more than 25% of the contracts are potentially vulnerable due to the missing security patches. To understand actual impacts of the missing patches, we manually investigated potentially vulnerable contracts that are detected by our static analyzer and identified common mistakes by Solidity developers, which may cause serious security issues such as financial loss. We detected hundreds of vulnerable contracts and about one fourth of the vulnerable contracts are used by thousands of people. We recommend the Solidity team to make patches that resolve known vulnerabilities correctly, and developers to use the latest Solidity compiler to avoid missing security patches.","1558-1225","978-1-4503-7121-6","","National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:NRF-2017R1A2B3012020,2017M3C4A7068177); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9283944","Empirical Study;Smart Contracts;Solidity;Security Patches","Smart contracts;Static analysis;Manuals;Tools;Encoding;Security;Software engineering","C++ language;contracts;electronic commerce;program compilers;program diagnostics;security of data;telecommunication security","smart contract security;security vulnerabilities;real-world Ethereum smart contracts;Ethereum smart contract developers;Solidity team;real-world Solidity contracts;vulnerability patches;missing security patches;potentially vulnerable contracts","","","","54","","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

SC is modernizing the traditional industrial, technical, and business processes. It is self-executable, self-verifiable, and embedded into the BC that eliminates the need for trusted third-party systems, which ultimately saves administration as well as service costs. It also improves system efficiency and reduces the associated security risks. However, SCs are well encouraging the new technological reforms in Industry 4.0, but still, various security and privacy challenges need to be addressed. In this paper, a survey on SC security vulnerabilities in the software code that can be easily hacked by a malicious user or may compromise the entire BC network is presented. As per the literature, the challenges related to SC security and privacy are not explored much by the authors around the world. From the existing proposals, it has been observed that designing a complex SCs cannot mitigate its privacy and security issues. So, this paper investigates various Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques and tools for SC privacy protection. Then, open issues and challenges for AI-based SC are analyzed.

Unfortunately, we cannot simply extrapolate those techniques to smart contracts. The major challenge is that smart contracts exhibit a nonuniform data access mode. Other than accessing the data via uniform addresses, smart contracts compromise multiple addressing modes, including flat address mode and key-value mode. More seriously, accessing a key-value table usually involves additional hash operations to obtain the keys. In this paper, we propose a DSE framework to resolve the nonuniform data access in smart contracts. More specifically, we exactly track the symbolic variables with concrete addresses and compute the actual/hash keys for table-like accesses. We also take the symbolic keys into account to distinguish data accesses incidentally with the same concrete keys resulting from artificially generated values. We describe the DSE framework in operational semantics. On top of the framework, we implement an integer overflow detector NOVA and a multi-transactional vulnerability detector MTVD. The experiments show that NOVA outperforms state-of-the-art analysis tools in detecting the integer overflows with much higher precision and recall, 94.2% and 93.0%, respectively.

In this work, we present an adaptive fuzzer for smart contracts on the Ethereum platform called sFuzz. Compared to existing Solidity fuzzers, sFuzz combines the strategy in the AFL fuzzer and an efficient lightweight multi-objective adaptive strategy targeting those hard-to-cover branches. sFuzz has been applied to more than 4 thousand smart contracts and the experimental results show that (1) sFuzz is efficient, e.g., two orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art tools; (2) sFuzz is effective in achieving high code coverage and discovering vulnerabilities; and (3) the different fuzzing strategies in sFuzz complement each other.","1558-1225","978-1-4503-7121-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9284013","Fuzzing;Smart Contract;Vulnerability;Ethereum;Blockchain","Computer languages;Smart contracts;Blockchain;Writing;Tools;Fuzzing;Software engineering","program diagnostics;program testing;programming languages;security of data;Turing machines","sFuzz;Solidity smart contracts;traditional programs;4 thousand smart contracts","","","","33","","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing vulnerability detection techniques are often designed case-by-case, making them difficult to generalize. In this paper, we design general principles for detecting vulnerable smart contracts. Our key insight is that almost all the existing transaction-related vulnerabilities are due to the mismatch between the actual transferred amount and the amount reflected on the contract's internal bookkeeping. Based on this, we propose a precise and generally applicable technique, VULTRON, which can detect irregular transactions due to various types of adversarial exploits.

Slither allows for the application of commonly used program analysis techniques like dataflow and taint tracking. Our framework has four main use cases: (1) automated detection of vulnerabilities, (2) automated detection of code optimization opportunities, (3) improvement of the user's understanding of the contracts, and (4) assistance with code review. In this paper, we present an overview of Slither, detail the design of its intermediate representation, and evaluate its capabilities on real-world contracts. We show that Slither's bug detection is fast, accurate, and outperforms other static analysis tools at finding issues in Ethereum smart contracts in terms of speed, robustness, and balance of detection and false positives.

We found that only 42% of the vulnerabilities from our annotated dataset are detected by all the tools, with the tool Mythril having the higher accuracy (27%).

As smart contracts are unpatchable (due to the immutability of blockchain), it is essential that smart contracts are guaranteed to be free of vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, smart contract languages such as Solidity are Turing-complete, which implies that verifying them statically is infeasible. Thus, alternative approaches must be developed to provide the guarantee. In this work, we develop an approach which automatically transforms smart contracts so that they are provably free of 4 common kinds of vulnerabilities. The key idea is to apply run-time verification in an efficient and provably correct manner.

Automated hardening at the bytecode level bypasses this source-level heterogeneity to enforce safety and code integrity properties of contracts independently of the sources whence they were derived.

One relevant feature associated with smart contract is the immutability property, which establishes the non-alteration of blockchain network data after the clauses of the contract are been approved by all parties or entities involved. For this reason, smart contract development requires more effort and care than the development of other common programs. They require systematic mechanisms to collect requirements and functional specifications.

One particular area based on the distributed ledger technology that has grabbed the attention of many technologist and financial marketers is “Smart Contracts”. Based on a cryptocurrency framework known as Ethereum, these smart contracts can be used for different applications such as Option Pricing, Currency Exchange, Revenue Management System, Crowd-funding and Peer-to-Peer networking. In our current effort, we have designed a smart contract and demonstrate that this smart contract could be used to take various possible positions in an European style option. We have analyzed the contract for potential security vulnerabilities when implemented in Blockchain.

Mythril's analysis engine is based on symbolic code execution and features different analyses for security vulnerabilities in smart contracts. We upgraded the analysis engine in order to model the gas usage of Ethereum smart contracts during execution. In order to utilize the newly acquired data, we added an analysis module to detect fallback functions, whose execution may exceed the defined threshold of gas.

At the time of this writing, there were over 10 million smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum networks and this number continues to grow at a rapid pace. Smart contracts are often written in a Turing-complete programming language called Solidity, which is not easy to audit for subtle errors. Further, since smart contracts are immutable, errors have led to attacks resulting in losses of cryptocurrency worth 100s of millions of USD and reputational damage. Unfortunately, manual security analyses do not scale with size and number of smart contracts. Automated and scalable mechanisms are essential if smart contracts are to gain mainstream acceptance. Researchers have developed several security scanners in the past couple of years. However, many of these analyzer either do not scale well, or if they do, produce many false positives. This issue is exacerbated when bugs are triggered only after a series of interactions with the functions of the contract-under-test. A depth-n vulnerability, refers to a vulnerability that requires invoking a specific sequence of n functions to trigger. Depth-n vulnerabilities are time-consuming to detect by existing automated analyzers, because of the combinatorial explosion of sequences of functions that could be executed on smart contracts. In this paper, we present a technique to analyze depth-n vulnerabilities in an efficient and scalable way by combining symbolic execution and data dependency analysis. A significant advantage of combining symbolic with static analysis is that it scales much better than symbolic alone and does not have the problem of false positive that static analysis tools typically have. We have implemented our technique in a tool called MPro, a scalable and automated smart contract analyzer based on the existing symbolic analysis tool Mythril-Classic and the static analysis tool Slither. We analyzed 100 randomly chosen smart contracts on MPro and our evaluation shows that MPro is about n-times faster than Mythril-Classic for detecting depth-n vulnerabilities, while preserving all the detection capabilities of Mythril-Classic.","2332-6549","978-1-7281-4982-0","10.1109/ISSRE.2019.00052","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8987460","Blockchain;Smart Contract;Symbolic Execution;Static Analysis","","contracts;cryptocurrencies;program diagnostics;program testing;program verification;symbol manipulation;Turing machines","Slither tool;Mythril-Classic tool;symbolic execution;data dependency analysis;depth-n vulnerability;contract-under-test;cryptocurrency;Solidity;Turing-complete programming language;Ethereum networks;trusted third-party;programmable trust mechanism;executable programs;scalable testing;symbolic analysis;static analysis;MPro;automated smart contract analyzer;scalable contract analyzer","","1","","18","","10 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Automation of processes with smart contracts is one of these features that significantly enlarge the scope of a blockchain implementation. Smart contracts help automate business processes by modeling business activities on the distributed ledger. Smart contracts are significantly different from other programs from a defect fixing and security issue handling perspective. The opportunity of fixing such issues is only available in the narrow window before registering the contract on to the blockchain. After a smart contract becomes a part of the chain, it is not possible to update or fix any issues. This distinct nature of smart contracts makes it essential to detect the program issues early on by paying attention to security smells. Security smells are clues that point to a deeper problem in the programming space. In this study, we review the literature and identify vulnerabilities that programmers and beneficiaries of smart contracts must avoid. We explain these security smells and categorize them based on their nature. We also review the applications that detect these vulnerabilities and provide information about their approach and coverage. Our main contribution is the evaluation of smart contracts as a platform or aid for mission-critical applications such as access control platforms. We conducted this evaluation by identifying the issues related to smart contracts and informing the reader about the problem, challenges, and techniques.

Generally, a smart contract is a piece of executable code that automatically runs on the blockchain to enforce an agreement preset between parties involved in the transaction. As an innovative technology, smart contracts have been applied in various business areas, such as digital asset exchange, supply chains, crowdfunding, and intellectual property. Unfortunately, many security issues in smart contracts have been reported in the media, often leading to substantial financial losses. These security issues pose new challenges to security research because the execution environment of smart contracts is based on blockchain computing and its decentralized nature of execution. Thus far, many partial solutions have been proposed to address specific aspects of these security issues, and the trend is to develop new methods and tools to automatically detect common security vulnerabilities. However, smart contract security is systematic engineering that should be explored from a global perspective, and a comprehensive study of issues in smart contract security is urgently needed. To this end, we conduct a literature review of smart contract security from a software lifecycle perspective. We first analyze the key features of blockchain that can cause security issues in smart contracts and then summarize the common security vulnerabilities of smart contracts. To address these vulnerabilities, we examine recent advances in smart contract security spanning four development phases: 1) security design; 2) security implementation; 3) testing before deployment; and 4) monitoring and analysis.

In particular, we analyze the specifics of deployment code used beyond actually deploying a contract in a quantitative and qualitative manner. To this end, we identify code patterns in deployment code by distilling recurring code skeletons from all external transactions and internal messages that contain deployment code. Tracking the use of these patterns reveals a set of vulnerabilities in contracts targeted by skillfully crafted deployment code. We summarize the encountered exploitative cases of collateral use of deployment code and report respective quantities. Example scenarios illustrate the recent usage. Collateral use of deployment code starts to appear in the middle of 2018 and becomes dominant among contract creations in autumn of 2018.

This article presents a novel static profiling technique for Ethereum smart contracts that, using static resource analysis, is able to generate upper-bound expressions that can be used to produce profiling information about the measure of interest. Unlike traditional profiling tools, we get upper-bounds on the measures of interest expressed in terms of the input arguments or the state variables of the smart contracts. The information that can be obtained by the upper-bounds allows us to detect gas-expensive fragments of a Solidity program or to spot resource-related vulnerabilities at specific program points of the program. Moreover, in this article we propose an automatic optimization of Solidity programs which reduces their gas consumption replacing the accesses to state variables by gas-efficient accesses to local variables.

Like IDSs for conventional programs, ContractGuard detects intrusion attempts as abnormal control flow. However, existing IDS techniques/tools are inapplicable to Ethereum smart contracts due to Ethereum's decentralized nature and its highly restrictive execution environment. To address these issues, we design ContractGuard by embedding it in the contracts to profile context-tagged acyclic paths, and optimizing it under the Ethereum gas-oriented performance model. The main goal is to minimize the overheads, to which the users will be extremely sensitive since the cost needs to be paid upfront in digital concurrency. Empirical investigation using real-life contracts deployed in the Ethereum mainnet shows that on average, ContractGuard only adds to 36.14 percent of the deployment overhead and 28.27 percent of the runtime overhead. Furthermore, we conducted controlled experiments and show that ContractGuard successfully guard against attacks on all real-world vulnerabilities and 83 percent of the seeded vulnerabilities.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2019.2949561","HKSAR RGC/GRF(grant numbers:16202917); National Key Research and Development Program of China Stem Cell and Translational Research(grant numbers:2018YFB1404402); Key R&D Program for Guangdong(grant numbers:2019B010137003); Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2016B030305006,2018A07071702,201804010314,2012224-12); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8883087","Blockchain;ethereum smart contract;intrusion detection system;anomaly detection","Smart contracts;Blockchain;Intrusion detection;Peer-to-peer computing;Context modeling;Runtime","embedded systems;security of data","defend Ethereum smart contracts;intrusion attempts;ContractGuard;Ethereum gas-oriented performance model;real-life contracts;Ethereum mainnet;embedded intrusion detection;malicious attacks;intrusion attacks;intrusion detection system;Ethereum decentralized nature;efficiency 36.14 percent;efficiency 28.27 percent;efficiency 83.0 percent","","4","","54","IEEE","25 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The agent purchases computing resource from CSP on credit and acts as a broker among leader-level and user-level reselling these computing resources to users. In the user-level, every user experiences social externality, which means users are interdependent. The leader-level subgame makes credit payment easier by making loaning and trading become a joint credit payment. The user-level subgame makes the market more active and closer to reality by introducing social externality. Besides, smart contracts can prevent malicious behaviors such as delay payment. We also conduct equilibrium analysis and prove the existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium in our Stackelberg game-based model. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to evaluate the cost of smart contracts and the performance of each entity with the proposed pricing mechanism.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2020.3024729","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9200703","computing resource trading;edge-cloud computing;Stackelberg game;social externality;smart contract;mobile blockchain","Contracts;Computational modeling;Resource management;Games;Internet of Things","","","","","","","IEEE","18 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This article presents the design and type-theoretic foundation of Nomos, a programming language for digital contracts that addresses these challenges. To express and enforce protocols, Nomos is based on shared binary session types. To control resource usage, Nomos employs automatic amortized resource analysis. To prevent the duplication or deletion of assets, Nomos uses a linear type system. A monad integrates the effectful session-typed language with a general-purpose functional language. Nomos' prototype implementation features linear-time type checking and efficient type reconstruction that includes automatic inference of resource bounds via off-the-shelf linear optimization. The effectiveness of the language is evaluated with case studies on implementing common smart contracts such as auctions, elections, and currencies. Nomos is completely formalized, including the type system, a cost semantics, and a transactional semantics to deploy Nomos contracts on a blockchain. The type soundness proof ensures that protocols are followed at run-time and that types establish sound upper bounds on the resource consumption, ruling out re-entrancy and out-of-gas vulnerabilities.","2374-8303","978-1-7281-7607-9","10.1109/CSF51468.2021.00004","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9505237","smart contracts;programming languages;session types;resource analysis","Computer languages;Upper bound;Fluctuations;Voting;Semantics;Smart contracts;Prototypes","blockchains;contracts;functional languages;functional programming;inference mechanisms;optimisation;program diagnostics;programming language semantics;protocols;type theory","shared binary session types;resource usage;automatic amortized resource analysis;linear type system;effectful session-typed language;general-purpose functional language;efficient type reconstruction;off-the-shelf linear optimization;common smart contracts;Nomos contracts;type soundness proof;resource consumption;resource-aware session types;digital contracts;type-theoretic foundation;programming language;Nomos' prototype implementation;linear-time type checking;protocols;blockchain;automatic inference;transactional semantics","","","","66","","10 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The interest in blockchain has been increasing since its emergence. Hyperledger Fabric is one of the permissioned blockchain frameworks. One of the characteristics of Hyperledger Fabric is it utilizes general-purpose programming languages, e.g., Go, Node.js, and Java, to implement smart contracts (called chaincode in Hyperledger Fabric). The advantages of utilizing these languages are already known to potential developers, and development tools might already exist. However, one of the disadvantages is that these languages were not originally designed for writing smart contracts. Hence, there may be risks that developers do not need to consider when using specific languages such as Solidity of Ethereum. Furthermore, even though development tools exist, how many risks are covered by the tools is an open question. In this paper, we focus on Go language and the tools. First, we surveyed what kind of risks are associated with chaincodes are developed using Go language and observed there are 14 potential risks. Then, we investigated how many risks can be covered by Go tools, e.g., golint and gosec, and a vulnerability detection tool for chaincodes called Chaincode Scanner. From our results, we observed that some risks are not covered by the existing tools. Hence, we develop a detection tool to cover risks by static analysis. Finally, in this paper, we describe how to find the risks with our tool and evaluate the usefulness.","","978-1-7281-1807-9","10.1109/IWBOSE.2019.8666486","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8666486","Smart Contract;Validation Tool;Blockchain;Hyperledger Fabric","Blockchain;Fabrics;Smart contracts;Tools;Proposals;DSL;Computer languages","data privacy;electronic money;Java;program diagnostics;risk management;security of data;software tools;specification languages","Ethereum;vulnerability detection tool;hyperledger fabric smart contracts;decentralized ledger technology;permissioned blockchain frameworks;Bitcoin;Go tools;Chaincode Scanner","","16","","28","","14 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because smart contracts source code might not be available, static analysis approaches mostly face the challenge of analysing compiled Ethereum bytecode, that is available directly from the official blockchain. However, due to the intrinsic complexity of Ethereum bytecode (especially in jump resolution), static analysis encounters significant obstacles that reduce the accuracy of exiting automated tools. This paper presents a novel static analysis algorithm based on the symbolic execution of the Ethereum operand stack that allows us to resolve jumps in Ethereum bytecode and to construct an accurate control-flow graph (CFG) of the compiled smart contracts. EtherSolve is a prototype implementation of our approach. Experimental results on a significant set of real world Ethereum smart contracts show that EtherSolve improves the accuracy of the execrated CFGs with respect to the state of the art available approaches. Many static analysis techniques are based on the CFG representation of the code and would therefore benefit from the accurate extraction of the CFG. For example, we implemented a simple extension of EtherSolve that allows to detect instances of the re-entrancy vulnerability.","2643-7171","978-1-6654-1403-6","10.1109/ICPC52881.2021.00021","Dipartimenti di Eccellenza; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9462980","Reverse engineering;Static analysis;Smart contract;Ethereum","Smart contracts;Prototypes;Static analysis;Blockchain;Detectors;Tools;Complexity theory","blockchains;contracts;flow graphs;Java;program diagnostics","official blockchain;static analysis algorithm;Ethereum operand stack;accurate control-flow graph;compiled smart contracts;EtherSolve;Ethereum smart contracts;static analysis techniques;security problems;substantial financial value;smart contracts source code;compiled Ethereum bytecode","","","","42","","28 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The marketplace is implemented on a permissioned blockchain infrastructure, where bids are stored to the immutable ledger and smart contracts are used to implement the MCP calculation and award service contracts to all winning bids. Utilizing the blockchain obviates the need for a trusted, centralized auctioneer, and eliminates vulnerability to a single point of failure.

Recent studies discovered many severe security and performance issues in smart contracts by applying static program analysis techniques to them. Given a smart contract, the majority of these analysis techniques need to first construct its control flow graph, which connects basic blocks through control flow transfers (CFTs), before conducting further analysis. Aims: The objective of this work is to understand the capabilities of static program analysis techniques to identify CFTs, and to investigate how static program analysis techniques can be improved if the CFTs are complemented. Method: We perform a comprehensive empirical study on six widely-used tools for smart contract analysis by using all deployed smart contracts to understand their capabilities to recognize CFTs. We capture all execution traces of all smart contracts to evaluate the number of CFTs covered by traces that are not found by those tools. We enhance a state-of-the-art tool, OYENTE for discovering vulnerabilities in smart contracts with the CFTs covered by traces to investigate how the tool is improved. Results: These studied tools fail to identify all CFTs due to several reasons, e.g., incomplete code patterns. Execution traces effectively complement these tool in recognizing CFTs. By including the CFTs covered by traces, the false negative rate of OYENTE can be reduced by up to 30%. Conclusions: Our study underlines the ineffectiveness of static analysis techniques due to the incapabilities of CFT identification.","1949-3789","978-1-7281-2968-6","10.1109/ESEM.2019.8870156","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8870156","","Smart contracts;Tools;Blockchain;Computer security;Static analysis","contracts;program diagnostics;security of data","static program analysis techniques;CFTs;smart contract analysis;static analysis techniques;control flow identification;control flow transfers","","2","","40","","17 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Smart contract vulnerabilities however made them a prime target to malicious attacks that are leading to huge losses. The research community is thus applying various software engineering technologies to smart contracts to address them. In general, to detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts, mutation and fuzz based testing approaches have been widely studied and indeed achieved promising performance on benchmark datasets. Generating test inputs with mutation approaches essentially relies on the available test cases in a smart contract program. In our preliminary study, however, we observed that 56.4% of 218 identified open-source smart contract project repositories do not provide any test case for validation. Fuzzing test inputs leads to random values and lacks practical usefulness. Our work addresses this problem: we propose an approach, Smartgift, which generates practical inputs for testing smart contracts by learning from the transaction records of real-world smart contracts. Leveraging a collected set of over 60 thousand transaction records, Smartgift is able to generate relevant test inputs for ~77% smart contract functions, largely outperforming the traditional fuzzing approach (successful for only 60% functions). We further demonstrate the practicality of the test inputs by using them to replace the test inputs of the ContractFuzzer state of the art smart contract vulnerability detector: with inputs by Smartgift, ContractFuzzer can now detect 131 of the 154 vulnerabilities in its benchmark.","2576-3148","978-1-6654-2882-8","10.1109/ICSME52107.2021.00009","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1005500,2020AAA0107704); Open Project Program of the Key Laboratory of Safety-Critical Software (NUAA); Ministry of Industry and Information Technology(grant numbers:XCA20026); European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(grant numbers:949014); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9609227","Test Input Generation;Smart Contract;Deep Learning","Software maintenance;Conferences;Smart contracts;Bit error rate;Prototypes;Fuzzing;Benchmark testing","","","","","","52","","24 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Researchers have proposed several methods on smart contract vulnerability detection. However, despite the numerous vulnerability-finding tools, few of them have ideal detection performance because most of them rely on fixed rules, which is inefficient. In this paper, a modularized and systematic Deep Learning-based framework is proposed to automatically detect smart contracts vulnerability, called DeeSCVHunter. Particularly, we focus on two types of smart contract vulnerabilities: reentrancy and time dependence. And we propose a novel notion of Vulnerability Candidate Slice (VCS) to help models capture the key point of vulnerability. We conduct experiments on real-world dataset and the results prove the effectiveness of VCS, which leads to 25.76% improvement in F1-score at most.

However, existing security auditing techniques are either limited in finding vulnerabilities (rely on pre-defined bug patterns) or very expensive (rely on program analysis), thus are insufficient for Ethereum. To mitigate these limitations, we proposed a novel semantic-aware security auditing technique called S-GRAM for Ethereum. The key insight is a combination of N-gram language modeling and lightweight static semantic labeling, which can learn statistical regularities of contract tokens and capture high-level semantics as well (e.g., flow sensitivity of a transaction). S-GRAM can be used to predict potential vulnerabilities by identifying irregular token sequences and optimize existing in-depth analyzers (e.g., symbolic execution engines, fuzzers etc.). We have implemented S-GRAM for Solidity smart contracts in Ethereum.

The expected advantages in terms of cost-effectiveness would be significant, indeed technical solutions are being investigated and large-scale deployment are planned by major utilities companies. However, introducing transactive energy in the smart grid entails new security threats, such as forging energy transactions. This paper introduces an infrastructure to support reliable and cost-effective transactive energy, based on blockchain and smart contracts, where functionalities are implemented as fully decentralised applications. Energy transactions are stored in the blockchain, whose high replication level ensures stronger guarantees against tampering. Energy auctions are carried out according to transparent rules implemented as smart contracts, hence visible to all involved actors.

Jamming is a kind of denial of service attack in communication layer of the electric grid. With regard to electricity market, Jamming means preventing remote sensors from transmitting measured data to the center of monitoring and control in order to gain illegal profit. In this paper, we consider smart grid as a multi agent system (MAS) for the purpose of securing smart grid network. To overcome jamming attack in the physical layer of communication network in electricity market, we propose utilizing a modified version of contract network protocol (CNP) as a kind of negotiation protocol among agents.

To ameliorate that process, this paper proposes a model of a consortium blockchain from the perspective of Bangladesh. Unlike the existing grids, the proposed smart grid will be able to ensure user security with the help of state-of-the-art technologies. The proposed system will provide features like easier grid integration of different renewable sources, bidirectional power flow to the grid, and smart energy monitoring. To solve the data vulnerability issues and to defend against denial of services and malware attacks on the smart grid, the proposed grid will store its data in a consortium blockchain, which is one of the most secure technologies and only the grid authority will have full access over their user's data. Furthermore, a secure transaction method has been proposed in this paper, that will ensure the integrity of the transaction between the grid authority and the consumers.","","978-1-6654-1962-8","10.1109/ETCCE51779.2020.9350911","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9350911","Smart Grid;Cyber-Security;Consortium Blockchain;Smart Contract;RES;SHA-235","Technological innovation;Power demand;Blockchain;Market research;Smart grids;Security;Monitoring","authorisation;grid computing;invasive software;power generation faults;power grids;security of data;smart power grids;telecommunication security","smart grid implementation;consortium blockchain;Bangladesh;worldwide electricity consumption;increasing power demand;classic grid arrangement;grid modernization;existing grid infrastructure;existing grids;easier grid integration;smart energy monitoring;grid authority","","","","35","","16 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a dynamic and lightweight attribute-based access control framework for blockchain-empowered IoT, to achieve secure and fine-grained authorization. The proposed scheme allows access to resources by evaluating attributes, operations, and the environment relevant to a request. The access policy is executed through smart contract in blockchain for security and flexibility. To further adapt to IoT device constraints, we design a access control framework based on decentralized application (DApp) which can maintain tamper-proof in a timely manner and be adapt to delay-intolerant application. When delay-intolerant access is required, access can be allowed according to local replica of blockchain, without a consensus of blockchain network. Considering the time-varying attributes of IoT devices, a trust management scheme is proposed based on Markov chain to resist the security fluctuation caused by the vulnerability of IoT devices.

Many of these constructions, including operational payment channels and atomic swaps, use a building block called Hashed Time-Locked Contract (HTLC).In this work, we distill from HTLC a specification (HTLC-Spec), and present an implementation called Mutual-Assured-Destruction Hashed Time-Locked Contract (MAD-HTLC). MAD-HTLC employs a novel approach of utilizing the existing blockchain operators, called miners, as part of the design. If a user misbehaves, MAD-HTLC incentivizes the miners to confiscate all her funds. We prove MAD-HTLC’s security using the UC framework and game-theoretic analysis. We demonstrate MAD-HTLC’s efficacy and analyze its overhead by instantiating it on Bitcoin’s and Ethereum’s operational blockchains.Notably, current miner software makes only little effort to optimize revenue, since the advantage is relatively small. However, as the demand grows and other revenue components shrink, miners are more motivated to fully optimize their fund intake. By patching the standard Bitcoin client, we demonstrate such optimization is easy to implement, making the miners natural enforcers of MAD-HTLC.Finally, we extend previous results regarding HTLC vulnerability to bribery attacks. An attacker can incentivize miners to prefer her transactions by offering high transaction fees. We demonstrate this attack can be easily implemented by patching the Bitcoin client, and use game-theoretic tools to qualitatively tighten the known cost bound of such bribery attacks in presence of rational miners. We identify bribe opportunities occurring on the Bitcoin and Ethereum main networks where a few dollars bribe could yield tens of thousands of dollars in reward (e.g., $2 for over $25K).","2375-1207","978-1-7281-8934-5","10.1109/SP40001.2021.00080","Israel Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9519476","Blockchain;Smart-contracts;Mechanism-design","Privacy;Smart contracts;Bitcoin;Tools;Software;Blockchains;Security","blockchains;contracts;cryptographic protocols;formal specification;game theory","Mutual-Assured-Destruction Hashed Time-Locked Contract;called miners;MAD-HTLC's security;MAD-HTLC's efficacy;HTLC vulnerability;HTLC-Spec;MAD-HTLC;Ethereum operational blockchains","","","","133","","26 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this problem, we propose the SMACS framework, where updatable and sophisticated Access Control Rules (ACRs) for smart contracts can be realized with low cost. SMACS shifts the burden of expensive ACRs validation and management operations to an off-chain infrastructure, while implementing on-chain only lightweight token-based access control. SMACS is flexible and in addition to simple access control lists can easily implement rules enhancing the runtime security of smart contracts. With dedicated ACRs backed by vulnerability-detection tools, SMACS can protect vulnerable contracts after deployment.

Thus, there is a significant need to better maintain smart contract code and ensure its high reliability. In this paper, we propose an automated approach to learn characteristics of smart contracts in Solidity, useful for repetitive contract code, bug detection and contract validation. Our new approach is based on word embeddings and vector space comparison. We parse smart contract code into word streams with code structural information, convert code elements (e.g., statements, functions) into numerical vectors that are supposed to encode the code syntax and semantics, and compare the similarities among the vectors encoding code and known bugs, to identify potential issues. We have implemented the approach in a prototype, named SmartEmbed, and evaluated it with more than 22,000 smart contracts collected from the Ethereum blockchain. Results show that our tool can effectively identify many repetitive instances of Solidity code, where the clone ratio is around 90%. Code clones such as type-III or even type-IV semantic clones can also be detected. Our tool can identify more than 500 clone related bugs based on our bug databases efficiently and accurately. Our tool can also help to efficiently validate any given smart contract against the known set of bugs, which can help to improve the users' confidence in the reliability of the contract.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2020.2971482","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8979435","","Computer bugs;Smart contracts;Cloning;Tools;Blockchain;Security","","","","5","","","IEEE","3 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, cyber-security failures may occur at places where the blockchain system connects with the real world. In this paper, we propose a novel risk assessment framework for blockchain applications in smart mobility. We aim at systematically quantifying the risk by presenting ordinal values because although vulnerabilities exist in a system, it's the probability that they can be exploited and the impact of this exploitation that determine if in fact, the vulnerability corresponds to a significant risk. As a case study, we carry out an analysis in terms of quantifying the risk associated to a multi-layered Blockchain framework for Smart Mobility Data-markets (BSMD). We first construct an actor-based analysis to determine the impact of the attacks. Then, a scenario-based analysis determines the probability of occurrence of each threat. Finally, a combined analysis is developed to determine which attack outcomes have the highest risk. In the case study of the public permissioned BSMD, the outcomes of the risk analysis highlight the highest risk factors according to their impact on the victims in terms of monetary, privacy, integrity and trust. The analysis uncovers specific blockchain technology security vulnerabilities in the transportation ecosystem by exposing new attack vectors.","2687-7813","","10.1109/OJITS.2021.3106863","Canada Research Program in Disruptive Transportation Technology and Services; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9520825","blockchain;cyber security;mobility;risk;vulnerabilities","Blockchains;Peer-to-peer computing;Risk management;Transportation;Security;Smart contracts;Privacy","blockchains;data privacy;mobile computing;probability;risk analysis;risk management;transportation","blockchain system;blockchain applications;ordinal values;vulnerability;blockchain framework;smart mobility data-markets;actor-based analysis;scenario-based analysis;risk analysis highlight;highest risk factors;specific blockchain technology security vulnerabilities;transportation ecosystem;cyber-security risk assessment framework;distributed ledger technologies;cyber-security failures;public permissioned BSMD;attack vectors","","","","32","CCBY","23 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition to this, the specifications also capture policy / procedure / contractual / regulatory / legislation / standard compliances with respect to a given client industry. The SDLC must adhere to service level agreements (SLAs) while being compliant to development activities, processes, tools, frameworks, and reuse of open-source software components. In today's world, global software development happens across geographically distributed (autonomous) teams consuming extraordinary amounts of open source components drawn from a variety of disparate sources. Although this is helping organizations deal with technical and economic challenges, it is also increasing unintended risks, e.g., use of a non-complaint license software might lead to copyright issues and litigations, use of a library with vulnerabilities pose security risks etc. Mitigation of such risks and remedial measures is a challenge due to lack of visibility and transparency of activities across these distributed teams as they mostly operate in silos. We believe a unified model that non-invasively monitors and analyzes the activities of distributed teams will help a long way in building software that adhere to various compliances. In this paper, we propose a decentralized CAG - Compliance Adherence and Governance framework using blockchain technologies.

On the other hand, fog computing has emerged as one of the most demanding field for research as it brings the services of cloud to the edge of the network, i.e. closer to the IoT devices. To satisfy the QoS requirement of latency sensitive applications, the concept of fog computing is introduced in order to implement the idea of smart home, city etc. Though the fog nodes can support latency sensitive applications, but their computational capacity is low which leads to more vulnerability against known attacks. But Ethereum has paved the way to develop smart contracts to implement any logic written in it upon calling. The usage of smart contracts in securing the fog node can be effective as it runs in a blockchain enabled network which makes the smart contract immutable and secured against modification. This creates a scope of using smart contract's logic to ensure the security of fog nodes and IoT devices which they earnestly require. This also eliminates the necessity of public-private key pair and other authentication systems used in fog-cloud architecture. In our work, we modified the conventional fog-cloud architecture by introducing blockchain-based fog layer to ensure better security and privacy for both fog layer and IoT devices.","","978-1-7281-7116-6","10.1109/ICECCE49384.2020.9179374","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9179374","Ethereum;Blockchain;Fog Computing;Smart Contract;Gas;DDoS;MITM","Contracts;Computer architecture;Cloud computing;Peer-to-peer computing;Computer crime","cloud computing;computer network security;cryptocurrencies;Internet of Things;quality of service","security improvements;Ethereum;blockchain-based distributed network;host decentralized applications;fog computing;IoT devices;QoS requirement;latency sensitive applications;smart home;fog node;computational capacity;smart contracts;blockchain enabled network;fog-cloud architecture;blockchain-based fog layer","","2","","21","","28 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The current PKI that use Registration Authorities/Certificate Authorities (RAs/CAs) model suffer from notorious security vulnerabilities. Most of these vulnerabilities are due to compromises of RAs, which lead to impersonation attacks resulting in CAs misbehaving to issue bogus certificates. To counter this problem, many approaches, such as Certificate Transparency (CT), ARPKI, and PoliCert, have been proposed. Nonetheless, no solution has yet gained widespread acceptance as a result of complexity and deployability issues. Moreover, existing approaches still require to satisfy complicated interactions and synchronisation among the entities that are involved during certificate issuance, updates, and revocations. In this paper, we propose a new Blockchain-Based PKI (BB-PKI) to address these vulnerabilities of CA misbehaviour caused by impersonation attacks against RAs. Certificate Issuance Request (CIR) should be vouched by manifold RAs. Multiple CAs shall sign and issue the certificate using an out-of-band secure communication channel. Any RA that contributes to the verification process of a user's request can publish the certificate in the blockchain by creating a smart contract certificate transaction. BB-PKI offers strong security guarantees, compromising $n - 1$ of the RAs or CAs is not enough to launch impersonation attacks, meaning that attackers cannot compromise more than the threshold of the latter signatures to launch an attack.","","978-1-7281-7649-9","10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS50907.2020.00108","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9408003","PKI;CA misbehaviour;Certificate revocation;Blockchain-based certificate management","Manifolds;High performance computing;Conferences;Smart contracts;Public key;Communication channels;Blockchain","authorisation;blockchains;certification;computer network security;Internet;public key cryptography","smart contract certificate transaction;impersonation attacks;Blockchain-Based Public Key Infrastructure Certificate management;real-world attacks;security vulnerabilities;bogus certificates;Blockchain-Based PKI;Certificate Issuance Request;out-of-band secure communication channel;Web public key infrastructure;BB-PKI;registration authorities-certificate authorities model;RA-CA model;CIR;verification process","","","","44","","26 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are many tools detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts trying to avoid potential attacks. However, we found that there are still many missed vulnerabilities in contracts. Motivated by this, we propose a methodology to reinforce EVM to stop dangerous transactions in real time even when the smart contract contains vulnerabilities. Basically, the methodology consists of three steps: monitoring strategy definition, opcode-structure maintenance and EVM instrumentation. Monitoring strategy definition refers to the specific rule to test whether there is a dangerous operation during transaction execution. Opcode-structure maintenance is to maintain a structure to store the rule related opcodes and analyze it before an operation execution. EVM instrumentation inserts the monitoring strategy, interrupting mechanism and the opcode-structure operations in EVM source code. For evaluation, we implement EVM<sup>*</sup> on js-evm, a widely-used EVM platform written in javascript. We collect 10 contracts online with known bugs and use each contract to execute a dangerous transaction, all of them have been interrupted by our reinforced EVM<sup>*</sup>, while the original EVM permits all attack transactions.

It is also essential to combine cybersecurity within the SCMS. In an effort to move towards smart grid, the Dubai Electricity & Water Authority (DEWA) initiated a long-term contract for the supply, installation, testing, and commissioning of 33 substations (132/11 kV) with modern automation systems for transmission power substations. DEWA has very strict requirements in terms of system availability, reliability, performance, cybersecurity, Ethernet network resiliency, and protection and communications redundancy. An HMI is included in the SCMS for local indication and control. Status, metering, and control data to the local HMI and remote utility enterprise system is provided by a redundant SCADA system. Reliable and secure communications to support mission-critical, high-speed protection schemes is achieved by an Ethernet network of utility-grade operational technology (OT) switches, not IT switches. The Ethernet network uses a modified ladder topology with IEC 62439 Part 1 Spanning Tree Algorithm (STA) via Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) for network resiliency and IEC 62439 Part 3 Parallel Redundancy Protocol (PRP) for message duplication. Data segregation and traffic control in the SCMS network is provided by IEEE 802.1 VLANs. The data acquisition and control along with engineering access and event report collection is accomplished using manufacturing message specification (MMS), whereas high-speed signal exchange for peer-to-peer protection schemes is accomplished using GOOSE communications protocols from the IEC 61850 communications standard. The DEWA technical SCMS specifications were built around the concept of future proofing and backward compatibility to support the evolution of smart grid capabilities by accepting smart technological advancements and future development of substation automation system features. It is strongly believed that the technical improvements made in DEWA specifications will lay a solid foundation for a sustainable automation system in DEWA over the years to come. Because DEWA is aware of the risks of digitizing substation communications networks and the recent increase in the number of cyberattacks against utilities that involve abusing vulnerabilities in the security of their communications networks, DEWA has strict cybersecurity requirements to prevent cyberinduced power outages that could potentially disrupt an electric power grid. The SCMS was designed with the holistic approach of a defense-in-depth philosophy, including supply chain security and physical security. The DEWA SCMS security design relies on a multilayer security zone approach to provide a scalable cybersecurity solution that automates tasks, streamlines operations, and improves performance. This paper discusses DEWA system requirements developed to facilitate the safe, reliable, and economical delivery of power in Emirate of Dubai. This is followed by a discussion of various engineering decisions that resulted from lessons learned during the design stage of the DEWA transmission power substation automation system to ensure that the system is ready for future smart grid requirements. Various analysis tools and testing techniques are described in the paper that were used to quantify the performance attributes of the IEC 61850-based system design.

The purpose of conducting a tender in government is to support the work program by finding the right tender (provider of goods and services) in the government procurement program so that it can be the basis of their decision to choose the most suitable tender. At the government in Indonesia, the tender process has been carried out using an e-tendering system with the use of internet technology through LPSE. The purpose of e-tendering is to facilitate the procurement process with related parties to increase productivity, effectiveness, and transparency in the tender process. However, problems in the e-tendering system are currently centralized, so that the local LPSE organization has full control of the database and the system which can pose a threat of vulnerability to fraud, collusion, and manipulation practices. The tender selection process that is full of competition must be supported by effective and transparent technology so that it does not cause fraud and suspicion among bidders. Blockchain technology is one of the solutions that allow integrated systems without a third party because it adheres to the decentralized nature of distributed databases so that it has a copy of many users.

As data in these applications flow through an open channel, i.e., the Internet, so security and privacy always a challenging issue. Though many solutions exist for this problem in literature, but these solutions are not adequate to handle security, privacy, latency, and efficient real-time delivery of healthcare services remotely over the wireless communication channel. Moreover, the existing UAV systems have security, reliability, latency, and storage cost issues, which restricts their applicability shortly. Motivated from these facts, this paper proposes VAHAK, an Ethereum Blockchain (BC) based secure outdoor healthcare medical supplies using UAVs. VAHAK provides reliable communication between the UAVs and the entities in a decentralized manner, which ensures the early delivery of required medical supplies to the critical patients. In VAHAK, security, privacy, and reliability issues have been resolved using Ethereum smart contract (ESC), while storage cost issues are handled with IPFS protocol. The security vulnerabilities of the VAHAK are tested on MyThril open-source tool. VAHAK is efficient in terms of data storage cost as it uses the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for healthcare record storage and 5G-enabled Tactile Internet (TI) for communication, respectively. Finally, VAHAK performance evaluation demonstrates its effectiveness as compared to the traditional systems where it outperforms the existing schemes with respect to various performance evaluation metrics, such as scalability, latency, and network bandwidth.","","978-1-7281-8695-5","10.1109/INFOCOMWKSHPS50562.2020.9162738","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9162738","Blockchain;UAV;Healthcare;Outdoor Delivery;Smart Contracts;Security","Security;Drones;Reliability;Medical diagnostic imaging;Hospitals;Memory","5G mobile communication;autonomous aerial vehicles;biomedical communication;computer network reliability;computer network security;cryptographic protocols;health care;Internet;medical information systems;medical supplies;public domain software","Healthcare 4.0 Services;blockchain-based outdoor delivery scheme;VAHAK performance evaluation;healthcare record storage;data storage cost;MyThril open-source tool;security vulnerabilities;Ethereum smart contract;reliability issues;required medical supplies;reliable communication;secure outdoor healthcare medical supplies;Ethereum Blockchain;storage cost issues;UAV systems;wireless communication channel;real-time delivery;privacy;open channel;smart applications;unmanned aerial vehicle","","6","","26","","10 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It provides a safe and secure means of exchanging any form of goods, service, or transaction. The presented blockchain-based implementation addresses the inadequacies of the centralized stock market infrastructure by verifying the authenticity of user’s holdings, imposing self-enforced smart contracts and achieving democratic and precise execution and agreement decisions by consensus mechanisms.

The current proof-of-work consensus algorithm used by many blockchain protocols suffer from vulnerabilities such as the majority attacks problem and strip mining. The algorithm often requires specialized application-specific hardware and involves energy-intensive computation, making it an unlikely candidate for power grid applications. On the other hand, the proof-of-stake consensus algorithm is susceptible to the well-known nothing-at-stake vulnerability issue, making it equally unlikely to be used in large-scale secured energy transactions. An energy-efficient locational marginal pricing-based hybrid proof-of-work, proof-of-stake consensus algorithm is proposed to mitigate such risks. The hybrid consensus algorithm uses an optimized market-based energy pricing model to select the mining and forging nodes. A detailed framework of the hybrid consensus algorithm is provided, along with an overview of its potential application to record large volumes of energy transactions and execute obligatory smart-contract agreements.","","978-1-6654-4067-7","10.1109/IEMTRONICS52119.2021.9422542","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9422542","Energy blockchains;proof of work;proof of stake;hybrid consensus;locational marginal price;smart-contract;initial coin offering","Strips;Protocols;Consensus algorithm;Blockchain;Pricing;Microgrids;Energy efficiency","contracts;energy conservation;power grids;power markets;pricing","energy-efficient locational marginal pricing-based;large-scale secured energy transactions;nothing-at-stake vulnerability issue;proof-of-stake consensus algorithm;power grid applications;energy-intensive computation;specialized application-specific hardware;strip mining;majority attacks problem;blockchain protocols;current proof-of-work consensus algorithm;grid operators;popular energy transaction platform;blockchain technology;energy applications;hybrid blockchain consensus algorithm;hybrid consensus algorithm;optimized market-based energy pricing model","","1","","34","","14 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Accordingly, delivering regular software updates is critical to secure IoT devices. Manufactures face two predominant challenges in providing software updates to IoT devices: 1) scalability of the current client-server model and 2) integrity of the distributed updates - exacerbated due to the devices' computing power and lightweight cryptographic primitives. Motivated by these limitations, we propose CrowdPatching, a blockchain-based decentralized protocol, allowing manufacturers to delegate the delivery of software updates to self-interested distributors in exchange for cryptocurrency. Manufacturers announce updates by deploying a smart contract (SC), which in turn will issue cryptocurrency payments to any distributor who provides an unforgeable proof-of-delivery. The latter is provided by IoT devices authorizing the SC to issue payment to a distributor when the required conditions are met. These conditions include the requirement for a distributor to generate a zero-knowledge proof, generated with a novel proving system called zk-SNARKs. Compared with related work, CrowdPatching protocol offers three main advantages. First, the number of distributors can scale indefinitely by enabling the addition of new distributors at any time after the initial distribution by manufacturers (i.e., redistribution among the distributor network). The latter is not possible in existing protocols and is not account for. Secondly, we leverage the recent common integration of gateway or Hub in IoT deployments in our protocol to make CrowdPatching feasible even for the more constraint IoT devices. Thirdly, the trustworthiness of distributors is considered in our protocol, rewarding the honest distributors' engagements. We provide both informal and formal security analysis of CrowdPatching using Tamarin Prover.","2643-7929","978-1-7281-8326-8","10.1109/NCA51143.2020.9306689","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9306689","Internet of Things (IoT);Secure Update Delivery;Blockchain;Smart Contracts;zk-SNARKs;Tamarin Prover","Protocols;Software;Cryptography;Proposals;Smart contracts;Scalability;Public key","client-server systems;computer network security;cryptographic protocols;Internet;Internet of Things;theorem proving","IoT deployments;constraint IoT devices;honest distributors;towards decentralized IoT updates delivery leveraging blockchain;zero-knowledge proof;regular software updates;manufactures;current client-server model;distributed updates;blockchain-based decentralized protocol;self-interested distributors;proof-of-delivery;CrowdPatching protocol;distributor network","","","","21","","5 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a system built on consensus, the correctness of a blockchain heavily relies on the consistency of states between its nodes. But consensus protocols of blockchains only guarantee the consistency in the transaction sequence rather than nodes' internal states. Instead, nodes must replay and exe-cute all transactions to maintain their local states independently. When executing transactions, any different execution result could cause a node out-of-sync and thus gets isolated from other nodes.After systematically modeling the transaction execution process in blockchains, we present a new attack INCITE, which can lead different nodes to different states. Specifically, attackers could invoke an ambiguous transaction of a vulnerable smart contract, utilize software bugs in smart contracts to lead nodes that execute this transaction into different states. Unlike attacks that bring short-term inconsistencies, such as fork attacks, INCITE can cause nodes in the blockchain to fall into a long-term inconsistent state, which further leads to great damages to the chain (e.g., double-spending attacks and expelling mining power). We have discovered 7 0day vulnerabilities in 5 popular blockchains which can enable this attack. We also proposed a defense solution to mitigate this threat. Experiments showed that it is effective and lightweight.","2641-9874","978-1-6654-0325-2","10.1109/INFOCOM42981.2021.9488749","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9488749","","Conferences;Smart contracts;Computer bugs;Earth Observing System;Software;Blockchains;Cryptocurrency","blockchains;cryptographic protocols","INCITE;vulnerable smart contract;node internal states;cryptocurrency;blockchain inconsistency attack mitigation;long-term inconsistent state;fork attacks;short-term inconsistencies;transaction execution process;node out-of-sync;local states;transaction sequence;consensus protocols;tamper-proof medium;software bugs","","","","20","","26 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These DDoS attacks use large scale botnets, which often exploit millions of compromised Internet of Things (IoT) devices worldwide. IoT devices are traditionally less secure and are easy to be exploited. The extent of these exploitations has increased after the publication of the Mirai botnet source code on GitHub that provided a foundation for the attackers to develop and launch Mirai botnet variants. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) proposed RFC 8520 Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) so that an IoT device can convey to the network the level of network access it requires to accomplish its standard functionality. Though MUD is a promising effort, there is a need to evaluate its effectiveness, identify its limitations, and enhance its architecture to overcome its weakness and improve its efficiency. The latest Mirai variant malware is exploiting vulnerabilities of Internet of Things devices. As MUD does not consider identifying and patching vulnerabilities present in the device before the issuance of the MUD profile, a device can be compromised even in the presence of the Manufacturer Usage Description profile by exploiting either the configuration vulnerabilities or firmware vulnerabilities present in the device. This paper presents an evaluation study of the Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD), identifies its weaknesses, and proposed enhancements in its architecture. This research proposed a mechanism for identifying and eliminating the configuration vulnerabilities before creating the MUD profile for a device to minimize the attack surface. This research adopts the OWASP firmware testing methodology for discovering vulnerabilities in the firmware of WiFi home routers. The device is allowed to request the MUD profile only if the identified firmware vulnerabilities are low. The identified firmware vulnerabilities are patched in case the score of the identified firmware vulnerabilities is moderate or high.

There is a possibility that the MUD URL might be pointing to a corrupted or malicious MUD profile hosted at the attacker file server due to the absence of an authentication mechanism in the MUD process. This research also proposed an authentication mechanism for device MUD profile, MUD file generator, and MUD file server.

This is due to the nature of IoT devices which use lighter protocols and which may be either hacked or physically tampered with. Thus, common approaches for threat modelling are insufficient on IoT environments, since they hardly catch all possible threats related to physical and protocols vulnerabilities. Furthermore, in IoT scenarios multiple parties can be involved, like in a transactive energy scenario, where nodes of the network can trade energy each other. So, it is important to catch risks that an attack may lead to each involved party. In this work, we propose a novel approach to model (i) the process list of a system and (ii) attacks towards it. Specifically, we extended the PROV-N semantic notation by including rules for modelling the attacks. We apply such modelling to ETSE [12], the architecture we proposed in the context of the PETRAS BlockIT project to enable energy trading among prosumers. ETSE manages the trading through a smart contract deployed on top of a blockchain distributed on the grid. Since in this context multiple parties are involved, we discuss possible issues that each attack may bring to the entire smart grid or to a specific prosumer.","","978-1-83953-089-0","10.1049/cp.2019.0147","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9038011","IoT security;blockchain;smart meter;smart contract;transactive energy","","","","","","","","","19 Mar 2020","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Due to vulnerability IoV devices must face malicious hackers. Nowadays with the help of blockchain (BC) technology energy system become more intelligent, eco-friendly, transparent, energy efficient. This paper highlights two major challenges i.e. scalability and security issues. The flavor of edge computing (EC) considered here to deal with the scalability issue. A BC is a public, shared database that records transactions between two parties that confirms owners through cryptography. After a transaction is validated and cryptographically verified generates “block” on the BC and transactions are ordered chronologically and cannot be altered. Implementing BC and smart contracts technologies will bring security features for IoV.

For this purpose, healthcare information exchange between health authorities can be leveraged as a fundamental concept to meet these demands and enable the discovery of new insights and cures. However, health data are highly sensitive and private information that requires strong authentication and authorization procedures to manage the access to them. In this regard, the cloud paradigm has been used in these e-healthcare solutions, but they remain inefficient due to their inability to adapt to the expanding volume of data generated from body sensors and their vulnerability against cyberattacks. Hence, collaborative and distributed data governance supported by edge computing and blockchain promises enormous potentials in improving the performance and security of the whole system. In this paper, we present a secure and efficient data management framework, named ”EdgeMediChain”, for sharing health data. The proposed architecture leverages both edge computing and blockchain to facilitate and provide the necessary requirements for a healthcare ecosystem in terms of scalability, security, as well as privacy. The Ethereum-based testbed evaluations show the effectiveness of EdgeMediChain in terms of execution time with a reduction of nearly 84.75% for 2000 concurrent transactions, higher throughput compared to a traditional blockchain, and scalable ledger storage with a linear growth rate.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3003575","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972172); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9121216","Blockchain;data sharing;edge computing;electronic medical records;healthcare;Internet of Things;privacy;security;smart contracts","Blockchain;Medical services;Edge computing;Security;Cloud computing;Smart contracts;Peer-to-peer computing","data privacy;electronic data interchange;health care;medical information systems","EdgeMediChain;hybrid edge blockchain-based framework;health data exchange;medical institutions;pharmaceutical companies;healthcare data;enhanced services;personalized medical services;healthcare information exchange;health authorities;fundamental concept;private information;authentication;authorization procedures;e-healthcare solutions;collaborative distributed data governance;edge computing;secure data management framework;efficient data management framework;healthcare ecosystem;Ethereum-based testbed evaluations;traditional blockchain","","3","","55","CCBY","19 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To enable public integrity auditing, third-party auditors as trusted ones verify data integrity on behalf of the data owner. However, the vulnerability of auditors should also be considered. We propose a Consortium Blockchain based Public Integrity Verification system (CBPIV). In CBPIV, the auditor behaviors are recorded in the consortium blockchain so that authorized parties can audit the auditor to see if the verification results are correct. A smart contract is deployed to check the behavior of the auditor automatically, which can trigger alerts for unusual behaviors.

Elsayed","ADC, Alexandria University,Alexandria,Egypt","2021 International Telecommunications Conference (ITC-Egypt)","20 Aug 2021","2021","","","1","8","Cyberattacks constitute a significant threat to information technology systems. Computer worms are used to conduct cyberattacks to compromise computers and the data stored on them. The self-propagation characteristic of computer worms allows them to spread fast and infect many hosts in a computer network. Thus, this makes it difficult for humans to deploy a timely countermeasure to confront worm infections within the attacked network. Worm containment is utilized to stop worm spread in a computer network. The containment technique should be automatic, timely, reliable, and implemented in a distributed manner. In this paper, we introduce Rearguard, a novel blockchain-based automatic worm containment system. Rearguard achieves worm containment by creating and distributing vulnerability-based filters for the vulnerabilities being exploited. A vulnerability-based filter is employed to drop any received network message contains variants of a worm that attempts to exploit the same vulnerability. The vulnerability-based filter generation is carried out utilizing a blockchain smart contract deployed in the attacked network. The blockchain ensures reliability, timely response, trustworthy filters, and the availability of all filters in a distributed ledger that is maintained by network hosts. Rearguard has been implemented against a synthetic worm. The obtained results show that Rearguard introduces low overhead as well as ensures timely and automatic response to worm attacks.","","978-1-6654-4574-0","10.1109/ITC-Egypt52936.2021.9513932","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9513932","","Computer worms;Distributed ledger;Computer network reliability;Smart contracts;Computer networks;Blockchains;Telecommunications","blockchains;computer network security;invasive software","Rearguard;information technology systems;computer worms;computer network;worm infections;worm spread;vulnerability-based filter generation;worm attacks;blockchain-based automatic worm containment system","","","","21","","20 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is challenging to track the provenance of data and maintain its traceability throughout the supply chain network. The traditional supply chains are centralized and they depend on a third party for trading. These centralized systems lack transparency, accountability and auditability. In our proposed solution, we have presented a complete solution for blockchain-based Agriculture and Food (Agri-Food) supply chain. It leverages the key features of blockchain and smart contracts, deployed over ethereum blockchain network. Although blockchain provides immutability of data and records in the network, it still fails to solve some major problems in supply chain management like credibility of the involved entities, accountability of the trading process and traceability of the products. Therefore, there is a need of a reliable system that ensures traceability, trust and delivery mechanism in Agri-Food supply chain. In the proposed system, all transactions are written to blockchain which ultimately uploads the data to Interplanetary File Storage System (IPFS). The storage system returns a hash of the data which is stored on blockchain and ensures efficient, secure and reliable solution.

Since using centralized architectures comes at the expense of trusting an authority, it has several inherent drawbacks, including vulnerability to security attacks, lack of data privacy, and unauthorized data manipulation. Hence, a new decentralized approach is crucial to remedy these drawbacks. One of the most promising technologies which is widely used to provide decentralization is blockchain.

Double Random Phase Encryption (DRPE), known as the typical way of optical encryption, can easily encrypt images. In the decryption process of DRPE, the complex conjugate of random phase mask used as the encryption key in the Fourier domain is used as the decryption key. As a result, computational DRPE has a vulnerability in image transmission when the random phase mask is stolen. Our proposed method utilizes the random function defined by the sender, and it generates additional random variable to multiply the random phase mask. Finally, our proposed method can enhance the security of the encryption process. However, the random phase mask and random variable information generated by random function are needed to decrypt the image.

Therefore, they are regulated and tracked across the healthcare sector to protect the health of the general public which is a highly prioritized rule in the health professional’s code of ethics. Healthcare centers that provide controlled medication to patients are still using manual papers to record controlled drugs production, delivery, prescription, administration, and disposal which causes delays in the system. Moreover, instances of controlled drugs misuse, abuse, and diversion still exist, which shows how the currently used system is inefficient in detecting such activities. Therefore, to ensure that the public health is safe and secure, an end-to-end system that tracks the whole healthcare supply chain is necessary. In this paper, we introduce a private Ethereum blockchain-based solution for the management of controlled medication.

This vulnerability can be detrimental to users and is difficult to mitigate with the increasing number of adversaries and targeted global attacks. Additionally, it must be stable and consistent because of the sensitive data that it holds. Due to its nature, ITS impacts other users - even those not part of the system - as they affect traffic efficiency and road safety. Thus, a Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consortium blockchain-based ITS with smart contracts was implemented. Using a co-simulation of MATLAB and NS3 through MEX bindings, an ITS simulation model was developed. Two types of data integrity attacks, namely GPS Spoofing and Sensor Deception, were integrated into the co-simulation. Afterward, data was gathered across different scenarios. The implemented blockchain-based system mitigated the data integrity attacks implemented and overall improved the security of the system.

Meanwhile, inherent vulnerabilities of IoT systems (including firmware and software) have been continually uncovered and thus the systems are always exposed to various attacks. The root cause of the issue is that IoT systems always have design flaws and implementation bugs. In particular, the released systems (e.g., by third-party marketplaces and IoT vendors) may be maliciously repackaged with malware. Unfortunately, IoT consumers are not able to effectively capture such vulnerabilities because of the limited detection capabilities. In this paper, we propose SmartCrowd, a blockchain-based platform that aims to outsource security detection of IoT systems to distributed detectors with strong detection incentives. SmartCrowd enables built-in accountability for IoT providers and authoritative references of detection results for IoT consumers. By building smart contracts, we can incentivize the efficient and high-coverage security detection of IoT systems, while providing decentralized and automated incentives for both IoT providers releasing secure IoT systems and detectors uncovering vulnerabilities. We present the security and theoretical analysis that demonstrates the security of SmartCrowd and the incentives for participators. We prototype SmartCrowd by using Ethereum and the experimental results show that SmartCrowd has both technical feasibility and financial benefits, which can be applied to build a secure IoT ecosystem.","2575-8411","978-1-7281-2519-0","10.1109/ICDCS.2019.00113","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8884853","Incentives, Blockchain, Decentralization, Automation, IoT System Detection","Detectors;Blockchain;Security;Ecosystems;Smart contracts;Malware","cloud computing;computer network security;Internet of Things;invasive software;mobile computing;peer-to-peer computing","IoT providers;secure IoT systems;SmartCrowd;secure IoT ecosystem;distributed IoT system detection;Internet of Things devices;IoT vendors;IoT consumers;coverage security detection;Ethereum","","5","","53","","31 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A consequence of its popularity has been the growth of processing and data storage requirements for any node participating in the Ethereum blockchain network. For constrained devices such requirements are often infeasible to meet. To cater for such nodes, a so-called light protocol has been proposed for Ethereum where the responsibility of maintaining a correct state representation is delegated to light protocol servers. Previous research has identified dependence on external state management as a potential security vulnerability that exclusively impacts light nodes. Although a simple mitigation strategy is available, it comes at the expense of increased latency. In this work, we propose a new Ethereum node type, which we call a subset node, as an extension of the light protocol. Our proposal allows subset nodes to gain a lower latency than a pure light node with comparable or even higher security assurances by tracking and evaluating only a subset of all of the transactions issued on the blockchain. We provide a formal proof on the correctness of the blockchain state used by the subset node under the proposed model. To evaluate the practical feasibility of the subset node model, we analyze one year of historical transaction data from Ethereum, and demonstrate that a subset node tracking the state of a single account can achieve a significant reduction in storage and computational requirements when compared to a full node.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3101717","European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme(grant numbers:779984); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9502687","Blockchain;Ethereum;transactions;transaction dependencies;light protocol;constrained devices","Blockchains;Protocols;Smart contracts;Security;Servers;Proposals;Peer-to-peer computing","cryptographic protocols","subset node model;historical transaction data;subset node tracking;permissionless blockchains;data storage requirements;Ethereum blockchain network;correct state representation;external state management;security vulnerability;Ethereum node type;pure light node;light blockchain protocol servers","","","","53","CCBY","30 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the increased attack surface offered by the growing number of connected vulnerable devices and complex nature of SDN control plane applications could overturn the huge benefits of such a system. This paper addresses the vulnerability of some unspecified security flaw in the SDN control plane application (such as a zero-day software vulnerability) which can be exploited to insert malicious flow rules in the switch that do not match network policies. Specifically, we propose a blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) based framework that supports switch flow verification and insertion; and additionally provides straightforward deployment of blockchain technology within an existing SDN infrastructure. While use of an external BaaS brings straightforward deployment, it obscures knowledge of the blockchain agents who are responsible for flow conformance testing through a smart blockchain contract, leading to potential exploitation. Thus, we design a strategy to prevent the blockchain agents from acting arbitrarily, as this would result in what is termed a “moral hazard”. We achieve this by developing a novel mathematical model of the fair reward scheme based on game theory. To understand the performance of our system, we evaluate our model using a Matlab based simulation framework. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm balances the needs of the blockchain agents to maximise the overall social welfare, i.e. the sum of profits across all parties.","","978-1-7281-6728-2","10.1109/GIOTS49054.2020.9119638","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9119638","blockchain;SDN;security;IoT;flow verification","","computer network security;cryptography;cyber-physical systems;distributed databases;game theory;Internet of Things;Matlab;program verification;software defined networking","blockchain agents;flow conformance testing;smart blockchain contract;blockchain-aided flow insertion;software defined networking;cyber-physical systems;SDN control plane application;software vulnerability;blockchain-as-a-service;switch flow verification;blockchain technology;SDN infrastructure;game theory;switch flow insertion;Matlab based simulation","","1","","21","","17 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this article, we propose a new decentralized health architecture, called BEdgeHealth that integrates MEC and blockchain for data offloading and data sharing in distributed hospital networks. First, a data offloading scheme is proposed where mobile devices can offload health data to a nearby MEC server for efficient computation with privacy awareness.

These risks and vulnerabilities, exploited by the threat agent to affect the valuable assets and services. In this work, we use a security risk management (SRM) domain model and develop a framework to explore two security risks - Sybil and Double-spending - that are observed and considered most concerning security risks within blockchain systems. The framework illustrates the protected assets or assets to secure, the classification of threats that the attacker can trigger using Sybil attack, the identification of threats that cause Double-spending, the vulnerabilities of identified threats, and their countermeasures. We evaluated a newly built framework by exploring Sybil and Double-spending risks in Ethereum-based healthcare applications. We also recognise the various other security and implementation challenges of blockchain that hinder the acceptance of blockchain-enabled solutions. Furthermore, we discuss the permissioned blockchain systems making an appearance in industry-level enterprises and how permissioned blockchain systems control these challenges. We conclude the paper and outline the future work that aims to build an ontology-based blockchain security reference model.

Recent work, however, raises serious concerns about the vulnerability of such systems to side-channel attacks. We propose, formalize, and explore a cryptographic primitive called a Sealed-Glass Proof (SGP) that models computation possible in an isolated execution environment with unbounded leakage, and thus in the face of arbitrary side-channels. A SGP specifically models the capabilities of trusted hardware that can attest to correct execution of a piece of code, but whose execution is transparent, meaning that an application's secrets and state are visible to other processes on the same host. Despite this strong threat model, we show that SGPs enable a range of practical applications. Our key observation is that SGPs permit safe verifiable computing in zero-knowledge, as data leakage results only in the prover learning her own secrets. Among other applications, we describe the implementation of an end-to-end bug bounty (or zero-day solicitation) platform that couples a SGX-based SGP with a smart contract. Our platform enables a marketplace that achieves fair exchange, protects against unfair bounty withdrawals, and resists denial-of-service attacks by dishonest sellers. We also consider a slight relaxation of the SGP model that permits black-box modules instantiating minimal, side-channel resistant primitives, yielding a still broader range of applications. Our work shows how trusted hardware systems such as SGX can support trustworthy applications even in the presence of side channels.","","978-1-5090-5762-7","10.1109/EuroSP.2017.28","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7961949","Side Channels;Trusted Hardware;Smart Contracts","Hardware;Computational modeling;Protocols;Software;Side-channel attacks","cryptography;trusted computing","sealed glass proofs;SGP;transparent enclaves;prove knowledge;sell knowledge;trusted hardware systems;side channel attacks;cryptographic primitive;data leakage;Denial of Service attacks;black box modules;software guard extensions;SGX","","12","9","67","","3 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On the other hand, Blockchain (BC) can be utilized to provide more secure data plane by introducing a fault-tolerant, decentralized and secure ledger without relying on any trusted third-party intermediaries. To this end, in this work we propose, DPSec, a consortium BC-based protocol for authenticating SDN's data plane including SDN switches and hosts. We also provide a proof-of-concept that demonstrates the applicability and feasibility of our protocol in SDNs.

Although the TTP-based paradigm provides customers with convenience, it causes a whole set of inevitable problems such as security threats, privacy vulnerabilities, and censorship. The TTP-based paradigm is not suitable for all modern networks, e.g., 5G and beyond networks, which are been evolving to support ubiquitous, decentralized, and autonomous services. Driven by the vision of blockchain technologies, there has been a paradigm shift in applications, from TTP-based to decentralized-trust-based. Decentralized applications (DApps) with blockchains promise no trust on authorities, tackling the key challenges of security and privacy problems. A main thrust of blockchain research is to explore frameworks and paradigms for decentralizing applications, fostering a number of new designs ranging from network architectures to business models. Therefore, this paper provides a compact and concise survey on the state-of-the-art research of decentralizing applications with blockchain in the 5G and beyond perspective. We provide four burning 5G and beyond challenges and discuss five aspects of motivation for decentralizing applications with blockchain. Then, we define nine fundamental modules of blockchains and explain the potential influence of these modules on decentralization in depth. We also discuss the interrelation between decentralization and some desired blockchain properties. Particularly, we present the capabilities of blockchain for decentralizing applications through reviewing DApps for 5G and beyond. We clearly distinguish three blockchain paradigms and discuss how developers to make right choices for 5G and beyond. Finally, we highlight important learned lessons and open issues in applying blockchain for decentralizing applications.

In order to solve single point of failure caused by the vulnerability of the cluster in CS, we used the characteristics of blockchain (i.e. de-centralization and de-trust) to ensure the security and correctness of the spectrum trading process. Specifically, a Blockchain Based Spectrum Sensing (BBSS) system is proposed, in which requester recruit sensing workers to involve in spectrum sensing, sensing workers obtain benefits by participating in spectrum sensing and miner verifies and packages transactions into the blockchain. In particular, the recruitment and sensing worker's response is modeled as a Reward-Sensing-time game, and the strategy of requester is the total reward R, and the strategy of sensing worker is the sensing time t. We proved that both of them can adopt strategies to maximize their own benefits. Simulation results show that requester benefit increases with the growing number of sensing workers, but the amplification is smaller and smaller. A certain sensing worker who adopted strategy can achieve larger benefit compared with random allocation of sensing time when the number of sensing workers is smaller (less than 500) in the system.","2693-2865","978-1-7281-5244-8","10.1109/ITAIC49862.2020.9338914","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9338914","crowd sensing;dynamic spectrum access;specrtum sensing;blockchain","Smart contracts;Blockchain;Games;Sensors;Security;Reliability;Task analysis","blockchains;cognitive radio;game theory;radio spectrum management;signal detection;telecommunication network reliability","blockchain;Spectrum Sensing system;sensing worker;Reward-Sensing-time game;sensing time t;Dynamic Spectrum Access;existing sensing technology;sensing nodes;narrow sensing range;Crowd Sensing;sensed data;reliability","","","","20","","3 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fog computing is promising to lower communication delay and offload network traffic with the scale of big data increasing in large-scale IoT application, which brings micro-data centers to the network edge, enabling the network edge to perceive, process, storage and calculate the massive data, reducing the amount of transferred data. However, numerous fog nodes at the network edge face an external attack resulting in serious security threats arising from the trusting relationship vulnerability because of the lack of the consideration of the properties of the fog computing system. This paper addresses the design for developing secure distributed data management platform for fog computing in large-scale IoT application, along with a blockchain-based data management implementation of the platform, which approaches the major challenges: how to realize the integration of data security and storage management for fog computing in large-scale IoT application and enrich rational interoperability for interconnected things. Experimental results show that the system works well to empower data provenance and transparency and defend against unauthorized access effectively in fog computing, scales well with loss of the performance of communication and computing maintaining in acceptable range, verifying the efficiency and feasibility of our design to provide privacy, integrity and fine-grained data management for fog computing in large-scale IoT application by introducing the data management platform based upon the blockchain network and smart contracts therein.","2474-9133","978-1-7281-7440-2","10.1109/ICCWorkshops49005.2020.9145381","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9145381","Secure Data Management;Blockchain;IoT Application;Fog Computing","Distributed databases;Edge computing;Authorization;Authentication","Big Data;cloud computing;cryptography;data integrity;data privacy;distributed databases;Internet of Things;storage management","large-scale IoT application;large-scale big data;fog computing system;secure distributed data management platform;blockchain-based data management implementation;data security;fine-grained data management;cloud computing;microdata centers;security threats;storage management;data provenance;privacy;smart contracts","","","","15","","21 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The popularity of a blockchain system is due to the fact that it offers a significant security advantage over other traditional systems. However, there have been many attacks in various blockchain systems, exploiting different vulnerabilities and bugs, which caused a significant financial loss. Therefore, it is essential to understand how these attacks in blockchain occur, which vulnerabilities they exploit, and what threats they expose. Another concerning issue in this domain is the recent advancement in the quantum computing field, which imposes a significant threat to the security aspects of many existing secure systems, including blockchain, as they would invalidate many widely-used cryptographic algorithms. Thus, it is important to examine how quantum computing will affect these or other new attacks in the future. In this paper, we explore different vulnerabilities in current blockchain systems and analyse the threats that various theoretical and practical attacks in the blockchain expose.

Security detection before system installation is not enough to ensure that IoT devices are always secure, because newly emerging vulnerabilities can still be exploited to launch attacks. To address this issue, retrospective detection is often required to trace the security status of IoT systems. Unfortunately, existing centralized detection mechanisms cannot easily provide a comprehensive security analysis. In particular, consumers cannot automatically receive security notification whenever a new vulnerability is uncovered. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-powered incentive platform, called SmartRetro, that can incentivize and attract more distributed detectors to participate in retrospective vulnerability detection and contribute their detection results. Leveraging smart contracts, consumers in SmartRetro receive automatic security feedback about their installed IoT systems. We perform the security and theoretical analysis to demonstrate that SmartRetro achieves our desirable security goals.We further implement SmartRetro prototype on Ethereum to evaluate its performance. Our experimental results show SmartRetro is technically feasible and economically beneficial.","2155-6814","978-1-5386-5580-1","10.1109/MASS.2018.00053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8567575","Blockchain;Incentives;Retrospective Detection","Security;Detectors;Performance evaluation;Internet of Things","computer network security;Internet of Things;telecommunication security","blockchain-based incentives;distributed IoT retrospective detection;malicious attacks;security detection;system installation;IoT devices;security status;comprehensive security analysis;consumers;security notification;distributed detectors;retrospective vulnerability detection;detection results;automatic security feedback;installed IoT systems;desirable security goals;SmartRetro prototype;centralized detection mechanisms;blockchain-powered incentive platform;Ethereum;Internet of Things","","4","1","34","","9 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An adversary can introduce false data injection (FDI) attacks to corrupt the network parameters in the communication channel causing wrong dispatches leading to the power disruptions. Particularly, the vulnerability of the deployed sensors and the weak protocols employed for information exchange might land at the hands of cyber-attackers. A lot of studies has been conducted to detect such cyber-hackings; however, less effort has been yielded to develop strategies to mitigate such adversaries. Therefore, considering the grid security, the paper presents two new novel schemes for attack mitigation for secure operation. Firstly, a new mitigation method is proposed by generating ACE-like signals incorporating the knowledge of bilateral contracts between players and the synchrophasor infrastructure. However, in situations where synchrophasor technology is not available, another mitigation method is presented in this paper by estimating the ACE signal in an offline AGC platform. A three-area model is considered to verify the potential of the proposed mitigation schemes. The obtained dynamic responses verify the efficacy of the proposed schemes. Later the results are scrutinized against satisfaction of NERC's control performance standards.","","978-1-7281-4251-7","10.1109/PESGRE45664.2020.9070588","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9070588","Automatic generation control;Cyber-attacks;Cyber-Attack mitigation;Synchrophasor infrastructure","Automatic generation control;Power system stability;Sensors;Phasor measurement units;Protocols;Monitoring","phasor measurement;power generation control;power grids;power system security","ACE signal;power system networks;heavy reliance;interactive technologies;cyber-attacks;false data injection;communication channel;power disruptions;protocols;information exchange;cyber-attackers;cyber-hackings;grid security;attack mitigation;secure operation;synchrophasor technology;offline AGC platform;intrusion mitigation schemes;NERC control performance standards;FDI attacks;false data injection attacks","","1","","20","","20 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In C-ITS infrastructure Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) communicate wirelessly with other AVs, Road Side Units (RSUs) and Traffic Command Centres (TCCs) using an open channel Internet. However, the use of the Internet brings inherent vulnerabilities related to privacy (e.g., adversary performing inference and data poisoning attacks), and security (e.g., AVs can be compromised using advanced hacking techniques) issues and prevents the faster realization of C-ITS applications. To address these challenges, this paper presents a privacy-preserving-based secure framework to provide both privacy and security in C-ITS infrastructure. The proposed framework provides two level of security and privacy using blockchain and deep learning modules. First, a blockchain module is designed to securely transmit the C-ITS data between AVs-RSUs-TCCs, and a smart contract-based enhanced Proof of Work (ePoW) technique is designed to verify data integrity and mitigate data poisoning attacks. Second, a deep-learning module is designed that includes Long-Short Term Memory-AutoEncoder (LSTM-AE) technique for encoding C-ITS data into a new format to prevent inference attacks. The encoded data is used by the proposed Attention-based Recurrent Neural Network (A-RNN), for intrusive events recognition in C-ITS infrastructure. The proposed A-RNN is trained using Truncated Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) algorithm. The framework is further validated and tested using two publicly available ToN-IoT and CICIDS-2017 datasets. The proposed framework is compared with peer privacy-preserving intrusion detection techniques, and the result shows the effectiveness of the proposed framework over several state-of-the-art techniques in both blockchain and non-blockchain systems.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2021.3098636","Ph.D. scholarship provided by Ministry of Education India; CPDS; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9505613","Blockchain technology;cooperative intelligent transport system (C-ITS);deep-learning;intrusion detection system;privacy-preservation.","Blockchains;Security;Servers;Data privacy;Intrusion detection;Privacy;Cloud computing","","","","","","","IEEE","3 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

There is evidence that observations and experiences from space throughout the millenniums have inspired ways to enhance security and to minimize vulnerabilities while facilitating the teaching of logistics and supply chain management. Security issues that are being dealt with today strategists and planners responsible for the transport and safe-keeping of goods and the well-being of logistics services providers include that of the threat and response; global positioning systemization for remote sensing capabilities within passive and active RFID systems; software algorithms capabilities built into equipment to allow ""intelligent"" or ""smart"" decisions to be made in remote areas of operation; observation of earth for the forecasting and monitoring of natural disasters and of organize crime, as well as the armed threat of forces from an adversary; new communication techniques, small satellites for facilitating surveillance and communications; design and construction of logistics support structures; solar panel energy power generation; international cooperation in space activities through global sourcing processes and other such space-influenced initiatives. Today as Turkey embarks on the procurement and contracting with satellite manufacturers for the oversight of the building and launching of its first military/defense satellite ""priority program"" for communications and surveillance operations, there is the recognition that an opportunity may exist for university students to become familiar with important methodological processes dealing with the acquisition by Turkey of certain aeronautical and space technologies - the bases of which can include a look at such applications and their connection to security needs within logistics and supply chain management activities. With this relatively late focus on Turkey's expansion into space, there may exist an opportunity to capture further the students' imagination into another dimension - that of the exploration of space as a source of tools for dealing with security issues. Recognition of this opportunity may be the initial step toward the inclusion of these issues into the development of the university course offering. Such a course would serve as a tool for teaching/training students to become familiar with the methodology for the appreciation of the global impact of space technologies as part of the logistics and supply chain program of study. It may further allow the student to gain insight about such programs and also may help to create more robust discussion and innovative thinking about development of the logistics and supply chain infrastructure. Such educated and trained students, during the course of their chosen career fields, may contribute by their seeking to be included in the planning sessions for collaboration on the security aspects of related projects - the objective being to find new ways to strategize Turkey's participation in the various logistics and supply chain management programs and thereby maximize returns to the country.","","1-4244-1056-8","10.1109/RAST.2007.4284073","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4284073","","Education;Logistics;Supply chain management;Security;Space technology;Artificial satellites;Supply chains;Remote monitoring;Surveillance;Military satellites","educational courses;international collaboration;logistics;national security;supply chain management;teaching","logistics and supply chain management;heightened security needs;space technology;goods transport;goods safe-keeping;communication techniques;small satellites;logistics support structures;solar panel energy power generation;international cooperation;space activities;global sourcing processes;Turkey;military/defense satellite;aeronautical technologies;space exploration;university course;students teaching/training","","","","36","","8 Aug 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
