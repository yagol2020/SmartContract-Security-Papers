Smart contract has the feature that cannot be modified once deployed, which can ensure the credibility of smart contract. Security incidents on blockchain platforms in recent years have been linked to smart contracts. If the code of the smart contract contains defects, it may bring unpredictable risks and losses to the contract participants. Therefore, it is very necessary for smart contract to detect defects before deployment. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a general platform for smart contract defect detection. The platform generates the abstract syntax tree of smart contracts, obtains the semantic description of corresponding functions, variables. Generate assertions by knowledge of security model libraries and semantic description of abstract syntax trees, and expressions, and then detects the defects of smart contracts. This paper introduces the design and implementation of the platform. Taking the variables parsed by the abstract syntax tree as an example, it explains in detail how the platform detects the delegatecall dangerous call vulnerability.","","978-1-6654-8090-1","10.1109/AEECA55500.2022.9918903","Research and Development; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9918903","smart contract;defect;semantic;functions","Electrical engineering;Codes;Smart contracts;Semantics;Computer applications;Syntactics;Libraries","blockchains;contracts;program diagnostics;trees (mathematics)","delegatecall dangerous call vulnerability;security model libraries;abstract syntax tree;unpredictable risks;blockchain platforms;semantic-based smart contract defect detection general platform","","","","13","IEEE","18 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing method for defect detection of smart contract bytecode using symbolic execution does not take care of the accuracy and detection realtime at same time. In this paper a smart contract bytecode defect detection algorithm based on parallel symbolic execution is proposed. We split a smart contract in units of functions by analyzing the smart contract function selection process. A symbolic execution tree is constructed for each function to predict the function execution path. Then we partition the symbolic execution tree into multiple sub-trees evenly. Finally, a process pool is used to perform parallel symbolic execution on those sub-trees to reduce the analysis time of smart contract defect detection. Experimental data shows our method has a significant improvement in detection efficiency compared with existing symbolic execution method. The speedup ratio is up to 3.1x in a 4-core computer. Besides, it does not introduce false positives or false negatives.","","978-1-7281-3657-8","10.1109/CIRSYSSIM.2019.8935603","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8935603","parallel optimization;smart contract;symbolic execution;defect detection;constraint solving","Smart contracts;Flow graphs;Task analysis;Security;Blockchain;Tools","cryptocurrencies;data flow analysis;program diagnostics;program testing;program verification;symbol manipulation;trees (mathematics)","smart contract defect detection;parallel symbolic execution;defect detection algorithm;smart contract function selection process;symbolic execution tree","","1","","19","IEEE","19 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The detection of contract defects is a method to avoid potential bugs and improve the design of existing code. Since smart contracts contain numerous distinctive features, such as the gas system. decentralized, it is important to find smart contract specified defects. To fill this gap, we collected smart-contract-related posts from Ethereum StackExchange, as well as real-world smart contracts. We manually analyzed these posts and contracts; using them to define 20 kinds of contract defects. We categorized them into indicating potential security, availability, performance, maintainability and reusability problems. To validate if practitioners consider these contract as harmful, we created an online survey and received 138 responses from 32 different countries. Feedback showed these contract defects are harmful and removing them would improve the quality and robustness of smart contracts. We manually identified our defined contract defects in 587 real world smart contract and publicly released our dataset. Finally, we summarized 5 impacts caused by contract defects.

They are immutable and cannot be modified, even when bugs are detected. Therefore, ensuring smart contracts are bug-free and well-designed before deploying them to the blockchain is extremely important. A contract defect is an error, flaw or fault in a smart contract that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. Detecting and removing contract defects can avoid potential bugs and make programs more robust. Our previous work defined 20 contract defects for smart contracts and divided them into five impact levels. According to our classification, contract defects with seriousness level between 1-3 can lead to unwanted behaviors, e.g., a contract being controlled by attackers. In this paper, we propose DefectChecker, a symbolic execution-based approach and tool to detect eight contract defects that can cause unwanted behaviors of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain platform. DefectChecker can detect contract defects from smart contracts’ bytecode. We verify the performance of DefectChecker by applying it to an open-source dataset. Our evaluation results show that DefectChecker obtains a high F-score (88.8 percent in the whole dataset) and only requires 0.15s to analyze one smart contract on average. We also applied DefectChecker to 165,621 distinct smart contracts on the Ethereum platform. We found that 25,815 of these smart contracts contain at least one of the contract defects that belongs to impact level 1-3, including some real-world attacks.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2021.3054928","Australian Research Council(grant numbers:DE200100021); ARC Laureate Fellowship funding scheme(grant numbers:FL190100035); ARC Discovery(grant numbers:DP200100020); Singapore's Ministry of Education(grant numbers:MOE2019-T2-1-193); Hong Kong RGC Project(grant numbers:152193/19E); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872057); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB0804100); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9337195","Smart contracts;ethereum;contract defects detection;bytecode analyze;symbolic execution","Smart contracts;Blockchain;Tools;Computer bugs;Computer hacking;Virtual machining;Organizations","blockchains;contracts;Java;program debugging;program diagnostics;program testing;program verification;Turing machines","automated smart contract defect detection;DefectChecker;EVM bytecode analysis;Turing-complete programs;bug-free smart contract;symbolic execution-based approach;Ethereum blockchain platform;open-source dataset","","18","","44","IEEE","27 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

DAO is a typical complex system with the characteristics of both social and engineering complexity. It is difficult for existing governance theories to solve governance problems in DAOs. The parallel intelligence theory based on the artificial systems + computational experiments + parallel execution (ACP) method is a suitable research and practical approach to solve management and control problems for complex systems. Therefore, we propose a parallel governance framework for DAO based on the parallel intelligence theory and discuss its key research issues. Finally, we construct a parallel governance system for GnosisDAO, and conduct computational experiments on its voting mechanism. The results show the defects of GnosisDAO governance mechanism and we thus propose further research directions.

In this paper, we propose a bidirectional long short-term memory neural network model (HAM-BiLSTM for short) with hierarchical attention mechanism, which takes the code segment and account information of a smart contract as input. It divides the input samples into three levels as documents: word level, sentence level and document level, and introduces attention mechanism in different levels. The aim is to detect reentrancy vulnerability more accurately and reduce the false alarm rate of the model as much as possible. The neural network model classifies smart contracts through softmax layers by learning feature information from training samples to determine the presence of reentrancy vulnerability.

The emergence of blockchain technology effectively solves the pain-point problem existing in the traceability system of agricultural food supply chains. This paper proposes a framework based on the consortium and smart contracts to track and trace the workflow of agricultural food supply chains, implement traceability and shareability of supply chains, and break down the information islands between enterprises as much as possible to eliminate the need for the central institutions and agencies and improve the integrity of the transaction records, reliability and security.

Software invariants are logical assertions that a program fragment needs to remain faithful during execution and work well in defect detection. This paper studies the scarcity defect detection method of smart contract digital assets based on invariant analysis for the first time. First, we point out eight scarcity defects in three categories and describe their examples. Next, we propose two invariants—transfer invariant and swap invariant—that should be maintained in digital assets’ management and transaction process. Then, we use the two invariants as test oracles and propose an oracle-based method to detect scarcity defects in smart contract.

The smart contract is at the center of blockchain systems and is a coded specification of an agreement between interacting partners in a transaction. Like other software artifacts, smart contracts are prone to carry residual faults. As many contracts are being used to handle financial transactions, huge losses may occur if a vulnerability is exploited. Also, a faulty contract cannot be corrected once it has been deployed on the blockchain, it can only be terminated and a new one must be deployed, which aggravates the cost of deploying contracts with faults and marks the reputation of the provider. Smart contract verification tools have been emerging, but limited knowledge is available regarding their real effectiveness. In this paper, we define a smart contract defect classification scheme based on the Orthogonal Defect Classification and apply it to a contract dataset, which has been extracted from multiple sources and holds different types of defects.

The presence of software defects in these contracts has notably caused failures, including severe security problems. In this article, we use software-implemented fault injection (SWIFI) to assess the behavior of permissioned blockchain systems in the presence of faulty smart contracts. We emulate the occurrence of general software faults and also blockchain-specific software faults (e.g., missing require on transaction sender) in smart contracts code and observe the impact on the overall system dependability in terms of reliability and integrity. We also analyze the effectiveness of formal verification and runtime protection mechanisms in detecting the injected faults. Results indicate that formal verification and runtime protections have to complement built-in platform checks to guarantee proper dependability of blockchain systems. The work presented in this article allows smart contract developers to become aware of possible faults in smart contracts and to understand the impact of their presence.

Due to the combinatorial explosion problem caused by the huge number of possible transaction sequences, the efficiency and scalability for existing security analyzers to detect multi-transaction sequence vulnerabilities are limited. To alleviate the problem, we propose a vulnerability detection approach based on symbolic execution and inter-path data dependency. In the approach, we first traverse paths in a contract, and record read and write operations of each path. Then, we selectively execute paths which are conducive to discovering vulnerabilities during the subsequent detection process according to inter-path data dependencies. By pruning out most paths that are not relevant to vulnerabilities, we improve the efficiency and scalability of detecting multi-transaction sequence vulnerabilities. We evaluate our approach on 442 contracts collected from CVE reports and 104 contracts with Ether leakage and suicide defects.

Once deployed, smart contracts are immutable, thus, defects in the deployed code cannot be fixed. As a consequence, software engineering anti-patterns, such as code cloning, pose a threat to code quality and security if unnoticed before deployment. In this paper, we report on the cloning practices of the Ethereum blockchain platform by analyzing 33,073 smart contracts amounting to over 4MLOC. Prior work reported an unusually high 79.2% of code clones in Ethereum smart contracts. We replicate this study at the conceptual level, i.e., we answer the same research questions by employing different methods. In particular, we analyze clones at the granularity of functions instead of code files, thereby providing a more fine-grained estimate of the clone ratio. Furthermore, we analyze more complex clone types, allowing for a richer analysis of cloning cases. To achieve this finer granularity of cloning analysis, we rely on the NiCad clone detection tool and extend it with support for Solidity, the programming language of the Ethereum platform. Our analysis shows that most findings of the original study hold at the finer granularity of our study as well; but also sheds light on some differences, and contributes new findings. Most notably, we report a 30.13% overall clone ratio, out of which 27.03% are exact duplicates. Our findings motivate improving the reuse mechanisms of Solidity, and in a broader context, of programming languages used for the development of smart contracts. Tool builders and language engineers can use this paper in the design and development of such reuse mechanisms.

Taking into account the social orientation of the pharmaceutical business, states impose special requirements for the safety, effectiveness, quality, conditions for the sale, transportation and storage of medicinal products. These requirements are not always fulfilled, which gives room for the technology to step in and assist. The aim of this paper is to analyze how smart contracts can help in addressing pharmaceutical supply chain issues with a focus on Belarus, which is the first country in the world to explicitly state that smart contracts are legal. This research uses a case study methodology to examine the potential for implementation of smart contracts in the supply chain of pharmaceutical products, the barriers for that and the possible influence of smart contracts on various stakeholders. Data collection was organized through document review and expert interviews. Results indicated that there are weak spots in the current pharmaceutical supply chain process, such as different kinds of errors in supporting documentation, quality defects and failures in climate control systems. Some vulnerable points in supply chain could be eliminated by smart contracts, for example, faults in maintaining temperature regime during transportation. The study also reveals a number of challenges for implementing smart contracts, such as resistance of users, bureaucracy, costs, the necessity for a lot of participants to be a part of a single network. In this regard, the study went on to propose a pilot project for implementing smart contracts in pharmaceutical supply chain.","","978-1-6654-5198-7","10.1109/iGETblockchain56591.2022.10087080","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10087080","smart contracts;supply chain;pharmaceutical supply chain","Industries;Law;Smart contracts;Supply chains;Transportation;Documentation;Companies","blockchains;contracts;data acquisition;health care;national security;pharmaceutical industry;product quality;production engineering computing;supply chain management","Belarus;climate control systems;data collection;health care system;medicinal products;national security;pharmaceutical business;pharmaceutical supply chain;quality defects;quality pharmaceutical products;smart contracts;social orientation","","","","34","IEEE","3 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to smart contract execution environment architectural defects, it is challenging for previous BC-AI systems to support computing-intensive tasks on-chain performing such as DNN convolution operations. They have to offload computations and a large amount of data from blockchain to off-chain platforms to execute smart contracts as native code. This failure to take advantage of data locality has become one of the major critical performance bottlenecks in BC-AI system. To this end, in this article, we propose SmartVM with optimization methods to support on-chain DNN inference for BC-AI system. The key idea is to design and optimize the computing mechanism and storage structure of smart contract execution environment according to the characteristics of DNN such as high computational parallelism and large data volume. We decompose SmartVM into three components: 1) a compact DNN-oriented instruction set to describe computations in a short number of instructions to reduce interpretation time. 2) a memory management mechanism to make SmartVM memory dynamic free/allocated according to the size of DNN feature maps. 3) a block-based weight prefetching and parallel computing method to organize each layer's computing and weights prefetching in a pipelined manner. We perform the typical image classification in a private Ethereum blockchain testbed to evaluate SmartVM performance. Experimental results highlight that SmartVM can support DNN inference on-chain with roughly the same efficiency against the native code execution. Compared with the traditional off-chain computing, SmartVM can speed up the overall execution by 70×, 16×, 11×, and 12× over LeNet5, AlexNet, ResNet18, and MobileNet, respectively. The memory footprint can be reduced by 84%, 90.8%, 94.3%, and 93.7% over the above four models, while offering the same level model accuracy. This article sheds light on the design space of the smart contract virtual machine for DNN computation and is promising to further boost BC-AI applications.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2022.3177405","CCF-AFSG Research Fund(grant numbers:CCF-AFSG RF20210031); Special Funding for Excellent Enterprise Technology Correspondent of Tianjin(grant numbers:21YDTPJC00380); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62002175); Open Project Fund of State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture; Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:CARCHB202016); Key Research Project of Zhejiang Lab(grant numbers:2021KF0AB04); Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City(grant numbers:20JCZDJC00610); Foundation of Information Security Evaluation Center of Civil Aviation; Civil Aviation University of China(grant numbers:ISECCA-202102); People's Republic of China ministry of education science and technology development center(grant numbers:2019J02019); Tianjin Graduate Scientific Research Innovation Project(grant numbers:2021YJSB014); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9780577","Deep neural network;smart contract;virtual machine;architectural support technology","Smart contracts;Blockchains;Virtual machining;Convolutional neural networks;Convolution;Task analysis;Random access memory","deep learning (artificial intelligence);image classification;instruction sets;multiprocessing systems;power aware computing;storage management;virtual machines","memory management mechanism;SmartVM memory dynamic free;DNN feature maps;block-based weight prefetching;private Ethereum blockchain;SmartVM performance;DNN inference on-chain;off-chain computing;smart contract virtual machine;boost BC-AI applications;blockchain-based artificial intelligence;deep neural network data;smart contract execution environment architectural defects;computing-intensive tasks on-chain performing;DNN convolution operations;off-chain platforms;data locality;BC-AI system;optimization methods;DNN such as high computational parallelism;fast on-chain DNN computations;parallel computing method;image classification;DNN-oriented instruction;instruction set","","","","52","IEEE","24 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Automation of processes with smart contracts is one of these features that significantly enlarge the scope of a blockchain implementation. Smart contracts help automate business processes by modeling business activities on the distributed ledger. Smart contracts are significantly different from other programs from a defect fixing and security issue handling perspective. The opportunity of fixing such issues is only available in the narrow window before registering the contract on to the blockchain. After a smart contract becomes a part of the chain, it is not possible to update or fix any issues. This distinct nature of smart contracts makes it essential to detect the program issues early on by paying attention to security smells. Security smells are clues that point to a deeper problem in the programming space. In this study, we review the literature and identify vulnerabilities that programmers and beneficiaries of smart contracts must avoid. We explain these security smells and categorize them based on their nature. We also review the applications that detect these vulnerabilities and provide information about their approach and coverage. Our main contribution is the evaluation of smart contracts as a platform or aid for mission-critical applications such as access control platforms. We conducted this evaluation by identifying the issues related to smart contracts and informing the reader about the problem, challenges, and techniques.

In this article, we propose a static defect detection method based on the knowledge graph of the Solidity language and present a defect detection tool called SoliDetector. First, we define the ontology layer of the knowledge graph and construct the instance layer in which syntactic and logical relationships are captured. Second, we introduce the defect pattern to describe each defect and design inference rules to infer complex relationships and judge whether a defect exists. Finally, we localize defects by executing SPARQL queries. SoliDetector can support the detection of 20 kinds of defects and the automatic SPARQL query generation. We conducted several experiments on multiple datasets. SoliDetector obtains a high F-score (i.e., 92.97% on Dataset1 and 91.54% on the SmartBug dataset). To compare SoliDetector with SmartCheck, Slither, and Mythril, we conducted experiments on a labeled benchmark Dataset3 and real-world contracts.

Firstly, it finds out potential vulnerable code regions using static analysis and identifies critical paths that may have security defects. Then, aiming at the problem that traditional search algorithms cannot actively locate and explore critical paths, this paper presents a multi-objective oriented path search (MOPS) strategy based on path priority. This strategy guides dynamic symbolic execution to cover critical paths quickly, avoiding blind traversal of program execution paths. Finally, it describes security rules and proposes corresponding detection logics for different vulnerability categories. This paper analyzes over 1000 smart contracts extracted from Etherscan. Compared with existing tools based on symbolic execution, the proposed method can reduce time consumption by around 35% while ensuring the accuracy of vulnerability detection. Moreover, existing tools often issue warnings that do not actually cause financial losses. But the proposed method only concentrates on code regions related to transfer of funds, so it can reduce the false alarm rate to some extent.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2947146","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2017YFB08029); Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications(grant numbers:NY219004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8867880","Block chain security;smart contract;vulnerability mining","Smart contracts;Security;Tools;Semantics;Blockchain;Explosions","contracts;cryptocurrencies;program diagnostics;program testing;search problems","detection logics;ecosystem security;frequent smart contract vulnerability incidents;critical-path-coverage-based vulnerability detection method;vulnerability categories;program execution paths;dynamic symbolic execution;path priority;multiobjective oriented path search strategy;traditional search algorithms;security defects;critical paths;potential vulnerable code regions;path explosion;current symbol execution tools","","10","","42","CCBY","14 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Because smart contracts source code might not be available, static analysis approaches mostly face the challenge of analysing compiled Ethereum bytecode, that is available directly from the official blockchain. However, due to the intrinsic complexity of Ethereum bytecode (especially in jump resolution), static analysis encounters significant obstacles that reduce the accuracy of exiting automated tools. This paper presents a novel static analysis algorithm based on the symbolic execution of the Ethereum operand stack that allows us to resolve jumps in Ethereum bytecode and to construct an accurate control-flow graph (CFG) of the compiled smart contracts. EtherSolve is a prototype implementation of our approach. Experimental results on a significant set of real world Ethereum smart contracts show that EtherSolve improves the accuracy of the execrated CFGs with respect to the state of the art available approaches. Many static analysis techniques are based on the CFG representation of the code and would therefore benefit from the accurate extraction of the CFG. For example, we implemented a simple extension of EtherSolve that allows to detect instances of the re-entrancy vulnerability.","2643-7171","978-1-6654-1403-6","10.1109/ICPC52881.2021.00021","Dipartimenti di Eccellenza; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9462980","Reverse engineering;Static analysis;Smart contract;Ethereum","Smart contracts;Prototypes;Static analysis;Blockchain;Detectors;Tools;Complexity theory","blockchains;contracts;flow graphs;Java;program diagnostics","official blockchain;static analysis algorithm;Ethereum operand stack;accurate control-flow graph;compiled smart contracts;EtherSolve;Ethereum smart contracts;static analysis techniques;security problems;substantial financial value;smart contracts source code;compiled Ethereum bytecode","","1","","42","IEEE","28 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, if the authorization logic of token contract is flawed implementation, the holder of token will suffer tremendous financial losses. In this work, we detect the authentication implementation of the flaws in ERC20 token, which has not been done before. We find the authentication process of the token is implemented by operating the authentication data structure of the token. Therefore, we capture the operations of the authentication data structure in token contract to infer authentication behaviors and detect authentication defects. However, it’s not a simple task as most smart contracts are not open source and the bytecode of token contract lacks type information. To tackle these problems, we utilize symbolic execution on the token bytecode, then identify the authentication data structure and capture the operations by parsing the symbolic expressions, and finally detect authentication defects through the inferred authentication behavior. To best our knowledge, this is the first work to detect the flaws in the implementation of authentication in ERC20 Token.

The smart contract model provides a safe, secure, and transparent platform for a bug bounty program. Testers will submit bugs via the blockchain, and companies will accept or reject the defect via the blockchain. Thus, testers will automatically get paid via the in-built smart contract system on a web interface, which will allow the tester to gain recognition and status no matter which company's bugs they find. The transactions on the chain will serve as a persistent and transparent record of software bugs, and IPFS will serve as a long-term storage system for bug details.","","978-1-7281-3783-4","10.1109/CCWC47524.2020.9031109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9031109","Blockchain;IPFS;Ethereum;Smart Contract;Bug Bounty Program;Cyber Vulnerability Market","Computer bugs;Companies;Contracts;Peer-to-peer computing;Protocols","contracts;cryptography;Internet;online front-ends;program debugging","software bugs;IPFS;long-term storage system;bug details;decentralized security bounty management;DApp;blockchain based bug bounty program;interplanetary file system storage paradigm;smart contract model","","3","","26","IEEE","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because of these technologies, various domains of power system will change. Power system operator will encounter various resources. Demand response resources which may be connected to distribution system or transmission system, distributed generation resources, energy storage systems, and renewable generations such as wind and PV farms are some of these resources. Power system operator should use a powerful methodology to manage these resources. Independent system operator should use a stochastic method to manage them. Stochastic unit commitment is presented in this paper to schedule various power resources such as distributed generation units, conventional thermal generation units, wind and PV farms, and demand response resources. Demand response resources which are connected to distribution network, Interruptible loads, distributed generation units, and conventional thermal generation units are used to provide required reserve for compensating stochastic nature of various resources and loads. In the presented model, resources connected to distribution network can participate in wholesale market through aggregators. Moreover, a three-program model which can be used by aggregators is presented in this article. Loads and distributed generation can contract with aggregators via these programs.

On one hand, as a new economic organization model, the existing corporate governance theories and methods are no longer fully applicable to DAOs. On the other hand, unpredictable logic vulnerabilities and code loopholes in the governance mechanism might cause devastating damage to DAOs. The parallel intelligence theory based on the ACP method (i.e., artificial systems, computational experiments, and parallel execution) is an elegant research paradigm and a practical approach tailored to solving these challenges. As such, we propose a novel parallel governance framework for DAOs based on the parallel intelligence theory and further discuss its technical methodology and implementation model.

This paper focuses on the use of blockchain for the inspection of steam generators of a nuclear power plant. This is a critical process where different actors participate: plant property, external companies in charge of the inspection itself and different administrations. It typically consists of a number of processes that explore the state of different components of the plant in order to find any kind of failure or defect and it generates a great amount of data that must be verifiable and trustworthy. A distributed blockchain-based system is presented where all the nodes share the information and it cannot be altered. As a novelty, automatic inspection algorithms are stored in the blockchain itself by means of smart contracts. The benefits of blockchain are studied for the nuclear industry in general and for the inspection process in particular. In order to explore the possible drawbacks of a blockchain-based system for data management, a simulator has been implemented to recreate the scenario of an inspection.

However, at the current stage, the abuse of data access permission and the difficulty in managing timeliness in administrative punishment still remain unresolved, which hinders the legalization and standardization of the administrative punishment system. Inspired by blockchain, which is inherently traceable, tamper-proof, and transparent, we design a system, punishment supervisor (PEATS), which is suitable for administrative punishment and technically overcomes the defects of the traditional administrative punishment procedure. To prevent the abuse of data access permission, we innovatively introduce the ACG (authorization control gateway) to verify the access permission of users based on the records in the MSD (market supervision department) contract. To ensure the timeliness of the administrative punishment procedure, we design a special case contract that has the same status as the general case processing state of administrative punishment to track case progress on the blockchain. We experiment and evaluate PEATS in terms of functionality and performance and find that PEATS provides traceability, transparency, and timeliness assurance. In addition, PEATS has 80.9% of the throughput of a traditional server with no more than an additional 3% latency and at most 60 KB additional storage space per case.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2023.3264805","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10108911","Market Supervision;Administrative Punishment;Blockchain;Smart Contract","Blockchains;Law;Smart contracts;Internet of Things;Personnel;Logic gates;Regulation","","","","","","","CCBY","25 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

If design defects persist in a cloud user identity authentication scheme, direct risks of sensitive data loss and severe information breach will be incurred. At present, the main problem of cloud user identity management system is that it relies too much on third-party services. Although some third-party-detachment schemes have been proposed in recent years, most of them still rely heavily on cloud server-centered design system. In this paper, a cloud user identity management protocol based on ethereum blockchain was proposed, followed by an establishment of a simple credit management system framework. The new protocol is an improved version of CIDM (Consolidated Identity Management) referred to as EIDM (Ethrerum-based Identity Management) protocol. In the improved protocol, JWT (JSON Web Token) in OAuth 2.0 was used to introduce smart contracts into EIDM protocol, and the credit management system was added to the system so that it can provide a credible identity authentication protocol for cloud users and service providers. The new protocol solves the problem of over-reliance on third parties in the existing identity management system solutions. In the end, an analysis on the security of the new protocol showed that the EIDM protocol proposed in this paper presents more diversified security guarantees relative to the CIDM protocol. The performance evaluation results also indicated that the new protocol demonstrates better practicability and flexibility.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2933989","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61572019); Key Research and Development Program of Shaanxi(grant numbers:2019GY-028); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8792212","Cloud computing;identity management;blockchain;reputation;smart contract","Cloud computing;Identity management systems;Blockchain;Smart contracts;Authentication","authorisation;cloud computing;cryptographic protocols;data privacy;message authentication;mobile computing","Ethereum-based cloud user identity management protocol;cloud system;cloud user identity authentication scheme;cloud user identity management system;third-party-detachment schemes;cloud server-centered design system;simple credit management system framework;EIDM protocol;credible identity authentication protocol;cloud users;service providers;CIDM protocol;identity management system solutions;ethrerum-based identity management;consolidated identity management","","16","","26","CCBY","8 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thousands of enterprise users and Internet of Things (IoT) devices have performed operations through services sold by computing resource providers. So far, the auction match is the main strategy for allocating resources, in which there exists a trusted third party playing a role as a broker to deal with resource allocation requests for both providers and consumers. The main concerns in resource allocation architecture are how and how long to solve the Winner Determination Problem (WDP), which is used to lay out the match outcome. It is not easy for a single broker with limited computing power to generate an optimal solution in a short period since its corresponding time complexity is regarded as the NP-hard problem. Meanwhile, it is hard for people to trust the third party thoroughly. That is, there are three potential issues, including centralization, data security, and untrustworthiness in traditional matching architecture. In particular, the real-time matching cannot be achieved to fulfill users who have urgent needs of computing resources. To solve above issues, we have designed a trustworthy and real-time decentralized computing resource allocation platform based on blockchain and smart contract. In order to optimize the allocation results, we improve the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) for miners to reach the consensus mechanism. Experimental results and comparison analysis have demonstrated that potential defects could be addressed in the new method, and the real-time resource allocation can be preserved firmly despite the balance vibration of market supply and demand.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2022.3215988","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9925641","Real-time;resource allocation;blockchain;smart contract;winner determination problem","Resource management;Real-time systems;Cloud computing;Smart contracts;Edge computing;Computer architecture;Supply and demand","blockchains;cloud computing;combinatorial mathematics;computational complexity;edge computing;genetic algorithms;resource allocation;trusted computing","auction match;blockchain;centralization;cloud computing;data security;decentralized computing resource allocation;edge computing;heterogeneous computing resource allocation;non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II;NP-hard problem;NSGA-II;resource allocation architecture;time complexity;trustworthy computing resource allocation;untrustworthiness;WDP;winner determination problem","","","","23","IEEE","20 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Lots of studies have been conducted to defend against poisoning attacks based on blockchain or hardware. However, 1) Blockchain-based schemes can only exploit on-chain data to deal with poisoning attacks due to the lack of off-chain trusted entities. 2) Typical hardware-based schemes have the bottleneck of single point of failure. To overcome these defects, we propose a defense scheme via multiple Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) and blockchain oracle. Benefitting from multiple TPMs verification results, a distributed blockchain oracle is proposed to obtain off-chain verification results for smart contracts. Then, the smart contracts could utilize the off-chain verification result to identify poisoning attacks and store the unique identifiers of the non-threatening IoT device immutably on the blockchain as a whitelist of federated learning participants.

The proposed architecture is introduced in detail from three aspects of infrastructure, side-chain of natural gas block based on data dimension, and backbone of natural gas block based on value dimension. Then the design issues on the integration existence of blockchain and AI in an actual natural gas IIoT scenario are discussed, including data association and interaction of blockchains, trusted identity authentication and management, energy source and virtual currency transformation, and so on. Next, an LSTM-based natural gas load prediction model is proposed by virtue of AI technology. The transaction model based on natural gas value and supply-demand relationship is also proposed by choosing the common natural gas application scenarios and taking advantage of blockchain technology. Experiments show that the proposed models can predict demand and output load of natural gas, while achieving the balance of interests of natural gas suppliers, users, and market in the transaction scenarios.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.011.1900532","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9199798","","Natural gas;Blockchain;Smart contracts;Load modeling;Predictive models;Industrial facilities","cryptocurrencies;distributed databases;Internet of Things;load forecasting;natural gas technology;power engineering computing;power markets;power system interconnection;recurrent neural nets","distributed energy supply;energy industry;centralized energy supply architecture;LSTM-based natural gas load prediction model;AI technology;blockchain technology;natural gas Industrial Internet of Things;design issues;energy interconnection development;power authentication;transaction model;supply-demand relationship;power market;virtual currency transformation","","9","","15","IEEE","18 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

In this paper, we first conduct a more in-depth survey of blockchain technology, focusing on its origins, the quantitative comparisons of consensus algorithms, the specifics of the cryptography employed in the blockchain (including public key cryptography, Zero-Knowledge Proofs, and hash functions), and the exhaustive list of use cases. Moreover, this study focuses on the blockchain's security measures. In specifically, we use a risk-based approach to evaluate blockchain security, developing a taxonomy of blockchain security risks, examining actual attacks and defects, and summarising newly created blockchain security solutions. We conclude with a discussion of the obstacles and emerging research trends that must be overcome to develop blockchain systems that are both scalable and secure enough for large-scale deployments.","","978-1-6654-5687-6","10.1109/IIHC55949.2022.10060296","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10060296","Blockchain;Internet of Things;Edge Computing;Wireless Networks;Data Transmission;Cloud Computing","Hash functions;Privacy;Taxonomy;Smart contracts;Fault tolerant systems;Focusing;Public key cryptography","blockchains;fault tolerance;public key cryptography","blockchain security risks;blockchain systems;consensus algorithms;fault tolerance;hash functions;public key cryptography;quantitative comparisons;risk-based approach;zero-knowledge proofs","","","","41","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This disease known as COVID-19 caused more than 180 million cases including more than 4 million deaths. Numerous false reports, misinformation, and unsolicited fears in regards to coronavirus, are being circulated regularly since the outbreak of the COVID-19. We can solve some of the problems of the pandemic with new technologies like blockchain, therefore we can control its spread until an effective and affordable vaccine is found. Blockchain can combat pandemics by enabling early detection of outbreaks, protecting user privacy, and ensuring reliable medical supply chain during the outbreak tracking. When ill people are detected, it is possible to quickly and accurately share their diagnostic information and clinical presentation with blockchain. We can also hide patients’ identity while sharing that information. Anonymization is supported in blockchain and it’s stronger than other techniques. Moreover, blockchain is transparent so that every disease event can be kept tabs on transparently. There are a lot of blockchain solutions in literature which is proposed recently to combat COVID-19-like pandemics. In this study, we aim to give the details of blockchain and why we can use it for light against pandemics and review proposed solutions. We summarized the problems of pandemic and the benefits of blockchain technology. We highlighted the defects of solutions in literature and propose alternatives.","2521-1641","978-1-6654-2908-5","10.1109/UBMK52708.2021.9558911","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9558911","Blockchain;Pandemic;Distributed Systems;Distributed Ledger Technology","COVID-19;Privacy;Pandemics;Government;Supply chains;Smart contracts;Blockchains","diseases;microorganisms;reviews","blockchain-based solutions;pandemic;infectious coronavirus disease;disease event;blockchain solutions;COVID-19;blockchain technology","","","","23","IEEE","13 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While many tools have been developed to identify a common set of vulnerabilities, the cross-contract vulnerability is overlooked by existing tools. Cross-contract vulnerabilities are exploitable bugs that manifest in the presence of more than two interacting contracts. Existing methods are however limited to analyze a maximum of two contracts at the same time. Detecting cross-contract vulnerabilities is highly non-trivial. With multiple interacting contracts, the search space is much larger than that of a single contract. To address this problem, we present <sc>xFuzz</sc>, a machine learning guided smart contract fuzzing framework. The machine learning models are trained with novel features (e.g., word vectors and instructions) and are used to filter likely benign program paths. Comparing with existing static tools, machine learning model is proven to be more robust, avoiding directly adopting manually-defined rules in specific tools. We compare <sc>xFuzz</sc> with three state-of-the-art tools on 7,391 contracts. <sc>xFuzz</sc> detects 18 exploitable cross-contract vulnerabilities, of which 15 vulnerabilities are exposed for the first time. Furthermore, our approach is shown to be efficient in detecting non-cross-contract vulnerabilities as well—using less than 20% time as that of other fuzzing tools, <sc>xFuzz</sc> detects twice as many vulnerabilities.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2022.3182373","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9795233","Cross-contract vulnerability;fuzzing;machine learning;smart contract","Smart contracts;Fuzzing;Machine learning;Security;Codes;Engines;Training","","","","2","","","IEEE","13 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"
