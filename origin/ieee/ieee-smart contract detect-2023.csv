Although smart contracts provide a convenient way to manage funds in the business, they also bring economic loss to users. Particularly, there are a huge number of malicious smart contracts running on blockchain, which defraud users of money. Therefore, identifying the intention of smart contracts is of great significance, which will help users have a better understanding of smart contracts and reduce their financial losses. In this paper, we purpose a supervised classification method to detect the intention of smart contracts. Specifically, we extract the features of smart contracts from codes and transactions, and then use XGBoost to classify smart contracts. We conduct extensive experiments on on-chain smart contracts.

Mutation testing is a fault-based testing method that can effectively improve the sufficiency of a test for smart contracts. However, existing methods cannot efficiently perform mutation testing specifically for integer overflow in ESCs. Therefore, by analyzing integer overflow in ESCs, we propose five special mutation operators to address such vulnerability in terms of detecting sufficiency in ESC testing. An empirical study on 40 open-source ESCs is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mutation operators. Results show that: (1) our proposed mutation operators can reproduce all 179 integer overflow vulnerabilities in 40 smart contracts, and the generated mutants have high compilation pass rate and integer overflow vulnerability generation rate; moreover, (2) the generated mutants can find the shortcomings of existing testing methods for integer overflow vulnerability, thereby providing effective support to improve the sufficiency of the test.","1007-0214","","10.26599/TST.2020.9010036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9515698","blockchain;Ethereum Smart Contracts (ESCs);integer overflow;mutation testing","Smart contracts;Testing;Contracts;Blockchains;Security;Tools;Sun","blockchains;contracts;program debugging;program diagnostics;program testing;public domain software","mutation testing;fault-based testing;mutation operators;ESC testing;smart contracts;open-source ESC;Ethereum smart contract testing;integer overflow vulnerability generation rate","","6","","","","17 Aug 2021","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Currently, deep learning has the best performance for detecting smart contract vulnerabilities. However, the common deep learning method treats the smart contract source code as a text sequence, ignoring the running logic and data flow of the program, and can not extract the constructed features. In this paper, a modular vulnerability detection model Link-DC is proposed. the model takes the contract graph constructed by smart contracts and the pattern features defined by expert knowledge as the original data input to capture richer feature information through stitching. Then, the deep and cross network is adopted to construct low-dimensional and sparse features into high-dimensional nonlinear features, thus improving the performance and efficiency of detection. Extensive experiments are conducted on smart contracts with vulnerabilities on the Ether and VNTChain platforms. The experiment results show that the high detection accuracy performance of the Link-DC model is obtained, where the accuracy of detection of re-entry vulnerability, timestamp-dependent vulnerability, and infinite loop vulnerability reaches 94.37%, 92.11%, and 85.29%, respectively.","","978-1-6654-5911-2","10.1109/CVIDLICCEA56201.2022.9824581","Natural Science Foundation of Jilin Province; Jilin Scientific and Technological Development Program; Innovation Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9824581","smart contracts;vulnerability detection;deep learning;feature interaction;cross network","Deep learning;Codes;Smart contracts;Feature extraction;Data models;Data mining","blockchains;contracts;deep learning (artificial intelligence);graph theory;program diagnostics;source code (software)","stitching;Ether;pattern features;blockchain operation;VNTChain platforms;high-dimensional nonlinear features;sparse features;low-dimensional features;cross network;deep network;contract graph;modular vulnerability detection model Link-DC;smart contract source code;deep learning method;smart contract vulnerability detection","","1","","15","IEEE","18 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since then, attacks on smart contracts have increased. Thus, the security issue of smart contracts has attracted more and more attention from the community, putting pressure on developers to discover security issues in smart contracts before deploying them. To address this problem, many researchers have developed smart contract analyzers to early detect potential vulnerabilities. However, a common problem with these tools is a large number of alarms with a high false positive rate. Consequently, developers need to spend much time and effort investigating the alarms which are falsely detected as vulnerable. In this paper, we propose SCAR, a novel approach to prioritize the alarms of static analysis tools. Based on the intuition that alarms with similar contexts tend to have the same labels (true positive or false positive), SCAR is built with two deep learning models to capture the patterns associated with the contexts of the labeled alarms. After that, for new alarms, SCAR calculates their likelihood to be true positives and ranks them according to the predicted scores. SCAR is evaluated on a large data set of 14,184 alarms from 47,518 realworld smart contracts. The results show that the programmers can productively find up to two-thirds of the actual vulnerabilities by investigating only 20% of the ranked alarms.","2640-0715","978-1-6654-5537-4","10.1109/APSEC57359.2022.00060","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10043329","Static analysis alarms;vulnerability;false positive;smart contract;representation learning","Deep learning;Smart contracts;Static analysis;Security;Context modeling;Software engineering","blockchains;contracts;deep learning (artificial intelligence);program diagnostics","deep learning models;labeled alarms;ranked alarms;SCAR;security issue;smart contract alarm ranking;smart contract analyzers","","","","16","IEEE","16 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), doctors can now remotely monitor and analyze patients, keep their data, and process it for further examination.

They are immutable and cannot be modified, even when bugs are detected. Therefore, ensuring smart contracts are bug-free and well-designed before deploying them to the blockchain is extremely important. A contract defect is an error, flaw or fault in a smart contract that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. Detecting and removing contract defects can avoid potential bugs and make programs more robust. Our previous work defined 20 contract defects for smart contracts and divided them into five impact levels. According to our classification, contract defects with seriousness level between 1-3 can lead to unwanted behaviors, e.g., a contract being controlled by attackers. In this paper, we propose DefectChecker, a symbolic execution-based approach and tool to detect eight contract defects that can cause unwanted behaviors of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain platform. DefectChecker can detect contract defects from smart contracts’ bytecode. We verify the performance of DefectChecker by applying it to an open-source dataset. Our evaluation results show that DefectChecker obtains a high F-score (88.8 percent in the whole dataset) and only requires 0.15s to analyze one smart contract on average. We also applied DefectChecker to 165,621 distinct smart contracts on the Ethereum platform. We found that 25,815 of these smart contracts contain at least one of the contract defects that belongs to impact level 1-3, including some real-world attacks.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2021.3054928","Australian Research Council(grant numbers:DE200100021); ARC Laureate Fellowship funding scheme(grant numbers:FL190100035); ARC Discovery(grant numbers:DP200100020); Singapore's Ministry of Education(grant numbers:MOE2019-T2-1-193); Hong Kong RGC Project(grant numbers:152193/19E); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872057); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB0804100); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9337195","Smart contracts;ethereum;contract defects detection;bytecode analyze;symbolic execution","Smart contracts;Blockchain;Tools;Computer bugs;Computer hacking;Virtual machining;Organizations","blockchains;contracts;Java;program debugging;program diagnostics;program testing;program verification;Turing machines","automated smart contract defect detection;DefectChecker;EVM bytecode analysis;Turing-complete programs;bug-free smart contract;symbolic execution-based approach;Ethereum blockchain platform;open-source dataset","","18","","44","IEEE","27 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The detection of contract vulnerabilities is currently a research hotspot in blockchain security [1]. Current research methods are mainly based on traditional software defect analysis methods for vulnerabilities detection, but the detection accuracy and false alarm rate are not satisfactory. In this paper, we propose a bidirectional long short-term memory neural network model (HAM-BiLSTM for short) with hierarchical attention mechanism, which takes the code segment and account information of a smart contract as input. It divides the input samples into three levels as documents: word level, sentence level and document level, and introduces attention mechanism in different levels. The aim is to detect reentrancy vulnerability more accurately and reduce the false alarm rate of the model as much as possible. The neural network model classifies smart contracts through softmax layers by learning feature information from training samples to determine the presence of reentrancy vulnerability. The experiments demonstrate that our proposed solution and model increase detection accuracy and reduce false alarm rate.","","978-1-6654-9691-9","10.1109/ICBCTIS55569.2022.00024","Chongqing Research Program of Basic Research and Frontier Technology(grant numbers:cstc2018jcyjAX0617); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9845089","smart contract;deep learning;attention mechanism","Training;Codes;Smart contracts;Neural networks;Information security;Software;Blockchains","blockchains;feature extraction;financial data processing;learning (artificial intelligence);recurrent neural nets;software reliability","reentrancy vulnerability detection;smart contract;bidirectional sequential neural network;hierarchical attention mechanism;contract vulnerabilities;blockchain security;vulnerabilities detection;false alarm rate;bidirectional long short-term memory neural network model;software defect analysis methods;softmax layers","","1","","8","IEEE","11 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since the amount of smart contracts on Ethereum has a rapid growth, which also lead to a large number of security vulnerabilities. However, the traditional method such as static symbolic analysis requires manual analysis in advance with high false detection rate. In this paper, we propose a GVD-net model for smart contract vulnerability detection. GVD-net consists of preprocessing section,backbone-net and detection section.We prepossess the source code and gain a weight matrix in the first section. In backbone-net, we generate a CFG graph according to the variables and function calling relationships of the solidity code, and use the CFG graph to build the corresponding relationship of nodes and generate a non-Euclidean graph. Then we use the adjacent search algorithm to generate a non-complete random walk sequence, and use the graph embedding algorithm Node2Vec to generate a 256-dimensional vector and gain another weight matrix. We input the test code into GVD-net to generate the threshold ϑ in the final section and will classify the smart contract as danger code if the ϑ is bigger than 0.75. Moreover, GVD-net will confirm the type of vulnerability according to weight matrix. We conduct comprehensive experiments on GVD-net with the SBcurated data-set, and the experiment results show that (1) GVD-net can classify a smart contract as safe or danger code, with the accuracy of 90.2% (2) GVD-net can detect three types of vulnerability (arithmetic issues, access control and asset frozen) and attain good performance within 1s.","","978-1-6654-5472-8","10.1109/ADMIT57209.2022.00024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9974924","","Access control;Codes;Machine learning algorithms;Source coding;Smart contracts;Manuals;Machine learning","arithmetic;authorisation;blockchains;contracts;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;random processes;search problems;source code (software);vectors","256-dimensional vector;access control;adjacent search algorithm;arithmetic issues;asset frozen;backbone-net;CFG graph;Dapps;decentralized blockchain network;distributed blockchain network;Ethereum smart contract;false detection rate;function calling relationships;graph embedding-based machine learning;GVD-net;Node2Vec;noncomplete random walk sequence;nonEuclidean graph;SBcurated data-set;security vulnerabilities;smart contract vulnerability detection;solidity code;source code;weight matrix","","2","","16","IEEE","16 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An interesting example of such graphs is control-flow graphs representing possible software code execution flows. As such graphs represent more semantic information of code, developing techniques and tools for such graphs can be highly beneficial for detecting vulnerabilities in software for its reliability. However, existing heterogeneous graph techniques are still insufficient in handling complex graphs where the number of different types of nodes and edges is large and variable. This paper concentrates on the Ethereum smart contracts as a sample of software codes represented by heterogeneous contract graphs built upon both control-flow graphs and call graphs containing different types of nodes and links. We propose MANDO, a new heterogeneous graph representation to learn such heterogeneous contract graphs’ structures. MANDO extracts customized meta-paths, which compose relational connections between different types of nodes and their neighbors. Moreover, it develops a multi-metapath heterogeneous graph attention network to learn multi-level embeddings of different types of nodes and their metapaths in the heterogeneous contract graphs, which can capture the code semantics of smart contracts more accurately and facilitate both fine-grained line-level and coarse-grained contract-level vulnerability detection. Our extensive evaluation of large smart contract datasets shows that MANDO improves the vulnerability detection results of other techniques at the coarse-grained contract level. More importantly, it is the first learning-based approach capable of identifying vulnerabilities at the fine-grained line-level, and significantly improves the traditional code analysis-based vulnerability detection approaches by 11.35% to 70.81% in terms of F1-score.","","978-1-6654-7330-9","10.1109/DSAA54385.2022.10032337","Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10032337","heterogeneous graphs;graph embedding;graph neural networks;vulnerability detection;smart contracts;Ethereum blockchain","Codes;Image edge detection;Smart contracts;Semantics;Data science;Software;Software reliability","blockchains;contracts;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence)","coarse-grained contract level;complex graphs;control-flow graphs;Ethereum smart contracts;fine-grained detection;fine-grained line-level;heterogeneous contract graphs;heterogeneous graph representation;heterogeneous graph techniques;heterogeneous graphs;homogeneous graph techniques;MANDO;multilevel embeddings;multilevel heterogeneous graph embeddings;multimetapath heterogeneous graph attention network;possible software code execution;smart contract datasets;smart contract vulnerabilities;software codes;traditional code analysis-based vulnerability detection approaches;vulnerability detection results","","1","","34","IEEE","8 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our approach consists of three main steps: 1) preprocess contract to be detected: when a contract is uploaded, its source code will be preprocessed to extract candidate pool for fuzzing and dependency graph which guides the automatic deployment of contracts; 2) fuzzing input generation: fuzzing input is generated to constitute transactions which will be sent to an agent contract to stimulate attacks, where runtime information is collected and recorded in the execution log during each execution; and 3) vulnerability verification: the execution log is analyzed to determine whether a reentrancy process occurs and whether the reentrancy process is malicious. We conduct comparative experiments on 204 tagged smart contracts and 90 injected contracts. The results show higher accuracy and lower false negative rate of ReDefender than that of the other three famous tools.

Existing efforts for contract security analysis heavily rely on rigid rules defined by experts, which are labor-intensive and non-scalable. There is still a lack of effort that considers combining expert-defined security patterns with deep learning. This paper proposes EtherGIS, a vulnerability detection framework that utilizes graph neural networks (GNN) and expert knowledge to extract the graph feature from smart contract control flow graphs (CFG). To gain multi-dimensional contract information and reinforce the attention of vulnerability-related graph features, sensitive EVM instruction corpora are constructed by analyzing EVM underlying logic and diverse vulnerability triggering mechanisms. The characteristic of nodes and edges in a CFG is initially confirmed according to the corpora, generating the corresponding attribute graph. GNN is adopted to aggregate the whole graph's attribute and structure information, bridging the semantic gap between low-level graph features and high-level contract features. The feature representation of the graph is finally input into the graph classification model for vulnerability detection. Furthermore, automated machine learning (AutoML) is adopted to automate the entire deep learning process. Data for this research was collected from Ethereum to build up a dataset of six vulnerabilities for evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that EtherGIS can productively detect vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Nonetheless, smart contracts are often designed to have collaborations among different functions for business activity to complete. We wonder whether this mismatch will make fuzzing techniques less effective than they should be. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we present the first work to show that security vulnerability detection can be significantly more effective in smart contract fuzzing if the entry functions of recent past test cases can be distinct.

Due to the combinatorial explosion problem caused by the huge number of possible transaction sequences, the efficiency and scalability for existing security analyzers to detect multi-transaction sequence vulnerabilities are limited. To alleviate the problem, we propose a vulnerability detection approach based on symbolic execution and inter-path data dependency. In the approach, we first traverse paths in a contract, and record read and write operations of each path. Then, we selectively execute paths which are conducive to discovering vulnerabilities during the subsequent detection process according to inter-path data dependencies. By pruning out most paths that are not relevant to vulnerabilities, we improve the efficiency and scalability of detecting multi-transaction sequence vulnerabilities.

Many techniques based on symbolic execution, fuzzing, and static analysis are used to detect contract vulnerabilities. Most of the current analyzers only consider vulnerability detection intra-contract scenarios. However, Ethereum contracts usually interact with others by calling their functions. A bug hidden in a path that depends on information from external contract calls is defined as an inter-contract vulnerability. Failure to deal with this kind of bug can result in potential false negatives and false positives. In this work, we propose Pluto, which supports vulnerability detection in inter-contract scenarios. It first builds an Inter-contract Control Flow Graph (ICFG) to extract semantic information among contract calls. Afterward, it symbolically explores the ICFG and deduces Inter-Contract Path Constraints (ICPC) to check the reachability of execution paths more accurately. Finally, Pluto detects whether there is a vulnerability based on some predefined rules. For evaluation, we compare Pluto with five state-of-the-art tools, including Oyente, Mythril, Securify, ILF, and Clairvoyance on a labeled benchmark and 39,443 real-world Ethereum smart contracts. The result shows that other tools can only detect 10% of the inter-contract vulnerabilities, while Pluto can detect 80% of them on the labeled dataset. Beyond that, Pluto has detected 451 confirmed vulnerabilities on real-world contracts, including 36 vulnerabilities in inter-contract scenarios. Two bugs have been assigned with unique CVE identifiers by the US National Vulnerability Database (NVD).

Existing efforts for contract security analysis heavily rely on rigid rules defined by experts, which are labor-intensive and non-scalable. More importantly, expert-defined rules tend to be error-prone and suffer the inherent risk of being cheated by crafty attackers. Recent researches focus on the symbolic execution and formal analysis of smart contracts for vulnerability detection, yet to achieve a precise and scalable solution. Although several methods have been proposed to detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts, there is still a lack of effort that considers combining expert-defined security patterns with deep neural networks. In this paper, we explore using graph neural networks and expert knowledge for smart contract vulnerability detection. Specifically, we cast the rich control- and data- flow semantics of the source code into a contract graph. To highlight the critical nodes in the graph, we further design a node elimination phase to normalize the graph. Then, we propose a novel temporal message propagation network to extract the graph feature from the normalized graph, and combine the graph feature with designed expert patterns to yield a final detection system. Extensive experiments are conducted on all the smart contracts that have source code in Ethereum and VNT Chain platforms. Empirical results show significant accuracy improvements over the state-of-the-art methods on three types of vulnerabilities, where the detection accuracy of our method reaches 89.15, 89.02, and 83.21 percent for reentrancy, timestamp dependence, and infinite loop vulnerabilities, respectively.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2021.3095196","Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:LQ19F020001); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61902348,61802345); Research Program of Zhejiang Lab(grant numbers:2019KD0AC02); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9477066","Deep learning;blockchain;smart contract;vulnerability detection;expert knowledge","Smart contracts;Feature extraction;Blockchain;Security;Semantics;Computer bugs;Knowledge engineering","blockchains;contracts;deep learning (artificial intelligence);graph neural networks;inference mechanisms","contract security analysis;designed expert patterns;Ethereum;expert knowledge;expert-defined rules;expert-defined security patterns;graph feature;graph neural networks;hacker attacks;infinite loop vulnerabilities;reentrancy;smart contract vulnerability detection;smart contracts;timestamp dependence;VNT Chain platforms;vulnerability detection","","38","","65","IEEE","7 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The logic behind the cross-industry applications is written in a specific language called a smart contract.

Smart contracts from various fields now hold over one trillion dollars worth of virtual coins, attracting numerous attacks. Quite a few practitioners have devoted themselves to developing tools for detecting bugs in smart contracts. One line of efforts revolve around static analysis techniques, which heavily suffer from high false positive rates. Another line of works concentrate on fuzzing techniques. Unfortunately, current fuzzing approaches for smart contracts tend to conduct fuzzing starting from the initial state of the contract, which expends too much energy revolving around the initial state of the contract and thus is usually unable to unearth bugs triggered by other states. Moreover, most existing methods treat each branch equally, failing to take care of the branches that are rare or more likely to possess bugs. This might lead to resources wasted on normal branches. In this paper, we try to tackle these challenges from three aspects: 1) generating function invocation sequences, we explicitly consider data dependencies between functions to facilitate exploring richer states. We further prolong a function invocation sequence  $\mathcal {S}_{1}$  by appending a new sequence  $\mathcal {S}_{2}$ , so that the appended sequence  $\mathcal {S}_{2}$  can start fuzzing from states that are different from the initial state; 2) we incorporate a branch distance-based measure to evolve test cases iteratively towards a target branch; 3) we engage a branch search algorithm to discover rare and vulnerable branches, and design an energy allocation mechanism to take care of exercising these crucial branches. We implement IR-Fuzz and extensively evaluate it over 12K real-world contracts. Empirical results show that: (i) IR-Fuzz achieves 28% higher branch coverage than state-of-the-art fuzzing approaches, (ii) IR-Fuzz detects more vulnerabilities and increases the average accuracy of vulnerability detection by 7% over current methods, and (iii) IR-Fuzz is fast, generating an average of 350 test cases per second.

Security is one of the major concerns against smart contracts which also exist various vulnerabilities as for any other traditional programs. What was worse, security vulnerabilities in smart contracts may lead to irreversible economic losses. Hence, there is an apparent demand for security audits of contracts before deployment. In recent years, a large number of smart contract vulnerability detection tools have emerged. The methods used by these tools include formal verification, symbolic execution, machine learning, and fuzz testing. These methods can well analyze vulnerabilities, but there are still limitations. In this paper, we optimized and extended the Mythril symbolic execution tool. The optimized pruning algorithm improves the speed of symbolic execution, while the proposed detection algorithm for Transaction Order Dependence vulnerability expands the range of detecting vulnerability. In addition, a machine learning vulnerability detection model is introduced as an auxiliary detection method, which is used to build the complete smart contract vulnerability detection system. The experimental results show that the proposed system reduces the execution time, and improves the accuracy as well as the recall of vulnerability detection compared with the original Mythril tool.","","978-1-6654-8045-1","10.1109/BigData55660.2022.10020730","Research and Development; Research and Development; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10020730","Smart Contract;Vulnerability;Symbolic Execution;Machine Learning","Economics;Machine learning algorithms;Smart contracts;Machine learning;Big Data;Fuzzing;Blockchains","formal verification;learning (artificial intelligence);program diagnostics;program testing;security of data","auxiliary detection method;complete smart contract vulnerability detection system;detecting vulnerability;improved vulnerability detection system;Mythril symbolic execution tool;security vulnerabilities;smart contract vulnerability detection tools;smart contracts;Transaction Order Dependence vulnerability;vulnerability detection model","","","","23","IEEE","26 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This work is an amalgamation of IoT and Blockchain technology which is imperative in today’s world. The proposed system takes inputs from various sensors through the Raspberry Pi module IoT device. Afterward, the data are passed to the Blockchain smart contract by running a javascript file. These sensor inputs are then used to trigger the smart contract under certain conditions and also create a transaction after the smart contract is triggered. The smart contract has been deployed on the Goerli Ethereum Test Network. The sensors used in the proposed work are the Ultrasonic sensor and Flame sensor. Certain threshold value has been set on both the sensors for which the smart contract gets triggered. The threshold value is modeled based on a flammable and fragile object being transported from a sender to a receiver. Whenever the distance of the object from the container is less than the threshold or if a flame is detected by the sensor, a transaction of Goerli ETH tokens is automatically processed from the sender’s account to the receiver’s account in a form of compensation.

Unfortunately, we cannot simply extrapolate those techniques to smart contracts. The major challenge is that smart contracts exhibit a nonuniform data access mode. Other than accessing the data via uniform addresses, smart contracts compromise multiple addressing modes, including flat address mode and key-value mode. More seriously, accessing a key-value table usually involves additional hash operations to obtain the keys. In this paper, we propose a DSE framework to resolve the nonuniform data access in smart contracts. More specifically, we exactly track the symbolic variables with concrete addresses and compute the actual/hash keys for table-like accesses. We also take the symbolic keys into account to distinguish data accesses incidentally with the same concrete keys resulting from artificially generated values. We describe the DSE framework in operational semantics. On top of the framework, we implement an integer overflow detector Nova and a multi-transactional vulnerability detector Mtvd. The experiments show that Nova outperforms state-of-the-art analysis tools in detecting the integer overflows with much higher precision and recall, 94.2 and 93.0 percent, respectively.

As one of the efficient and effective smart contract vulnerability detection methods, deep learning methods have been studied due to the fast detection speed and the high detection accuracy. Recently, the deep learning methods using convolutional neural network(CNN) have actively studied to classify images transformed from smart contracts into vulnerable or invulnerable. However, while simply transforming a smart contract into an image and analyzing, semantics and context of the smart contract are ignored to cause false detection alarms. To detect vulnerable smart contracts while maintaining their semantics and context, we propose a new code-targeted CNN architecture, called CodeNet. To improve the performance of CodeNet, we also design a data pre-processing procedure, where a smart contract is transformed into an image while maintaining locality.

Software invariants are logical assertions that a program fragment needs to remain faithful during execution and work well in defect detection. This paper studies the scarcity defect detection method of smart contract digital assets based on invariant analysis for the first time. First, we point out eight scarcity defects in three categories and describe their examples. Next, we propose two invariants—transfer invariant and swap invariant—that should be maintained in digital assets’ management and transaction process. Then, we use the two invariants as test oracles and propose an oracle-based method to detect scarcity defects in smart contract.

First, we define the ontology layer of the knowledge graph and construct the instance layer in which syntactic and logical relationships are captured. Second, we introduce the defect pattern to describe each defect and design inference rules to infer complex relationships and judge whether a defect exists. Finally, we localize defects by executing SPARQL queries. SoliDetector can support the detection of 20 kinds of defects and the automatic SPARQL query generation. We conducted several experiments on multiple datasets. SoliDetector obtains a high F-score (i.e., 92.97% on Dataset1 and 91.54% on the SmartBug dataset). To compare SoliDetector with SmartCheck, Slither, and Mythril, we conducted experiments on a labeled benchmark Dataset3 and real-world contracts.

The major role of ERC20 tokens is to carry out various trades and loans in decentralized applications (DApps). To participate in DApps, users must grant the DApps permission to spend tokens on user behalf. However, if the authorization logic of token contract is flawed implementation, the holder of token will suffer tremendous financial losses. In this work, we detect the authentication implementation of the flaws in ERC20 token, which has not been done before. We find the authentication process of the token is implemented by operating the authentication data structure of the token. Therefore, we capture the operations of the authentication data structure in token contract to infer authentication behaviors and detect authentication defects. However, it’s not a simple task as most smart contracts are not open source and the bytecode of token contract lacks type information. To tackle these problems, we utilize symbolic execution on the token bytecode, then identify the authentication data structure and capture the operations by parsing the symbolic expressions, and finally detect authentication defects through the inferred authentication behavior. To best our knowledge, this is the first work to detect the flaws in the implementation of authentication in ERC20 Token. To automate the analysis, we implement our approach in a new tool named TokenCat and use it to inspect 245,822 tokens.

Attackers launch front-running attacks by inserting additional transactions before upcoming victim transactions to manipulate victim transaction executions and make profits. Recent studies have shown that front-running attacks are prevalent on the Ethereum blockchain and have caused millions of US dollars loss. It is the vulnerabilities in smart contracts, which are blockchain programs invoked by transactions, that enable the front-running attack opportunities. Although techniques to detect front-running vulnerabilities have been proposed, their performance on real-world vulnerable contracts is unclear. There is no large-scale benchmark based on real attacks to evaluate their capabilities. We make four contributions in this paper. First, we design an effective algorithm to mine real-world attacks in the blockchain history. The evaluation shows that our mining algorithm is more effective and comprehensive, achieving higher recall in finding real attacks than the previous study. Second, we propose an automated and scalable vulnerability localization approach to localize code snippets in smart contracts that enable front-running attacks. The evaluation also shows that our localization approaches are effective in achieving higher precision in pinpointing vulnerabilities compared to the baseline technique. Third, we build a benchmark consisting of 513 real-world attacks with vulnerable code labeled in 235 distinct smart contracts, which is useful to help understand the nature of front-running attacks, vulnerabilities in smart contracts, and evaluate vulnerability detection techniques. Last but not least, we conduct an empirical evaluation of seven state-of-the-art vulnerability detection techniques on our benchmark. The evaluation experiment reveals the inadequacy of existing techniques in detecting front-running vulnerabilities, with a low recall of $\leq$ 6.04%.

However, the distributed nature of IA entities and the usage of insecure wireless communication open various challenges related to data sharing, monitoring, storage, and further makes the entire IA ecosystem vulnerable to various potential attacks. In this article, we exploit deep learning and smart contract to propose a new IoT-enabled IA framework for enabling secure data sharing among its various entities. Specifically, first we develop new authentication and key management scheme to ensure secure data transmission in IoT-enabled IA. The encrypted transactions are then used by the CS to analyze and further detect intrusions by a novel deep learning architecture. In CS, the smart contract (SC)-based consensus mechanism is executed on legitimate transactions that verifies and adds the formed blocks into blockchain by a peer-to-peer CSs network. In comparison to existing competing security solutions, a rigorous comparative research demonstrates that the proposed approach provides greater security and more utility characteristics.","1941-1294","","10.1109/MIS.2022.3201553","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9872064","Blockchain;Deep Learning;Internet of Things (IoT);Smart Contracts;Intelligent Agriculture (IA)","Deep learning;Internet of Things;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Smart contracts;Ecosystems;Authentication;Training","","","","7","","","CCBY","31 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, how to protect the profit of the data producer from rogue consumers that may resell without authorization remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a smart-contract based protocol to protect the profit of the data producer while allowing consumers to resell the data legitimately. The protocol ensures the revenue is shared with the data producer over authorized reselling, and detects any unauthorized reselling. We also introduce a data relay process that can enhance data accessibility in wireless edge networks. We formulate a revenue sharing problem to maximize the profit of both the data producer and resellers/relayers. We formulate the problem into a two-stage Stackelberg game and determine a ratio to share the reselling revenue between the data producer and resellers/relayers.

Face detection feature has been incorporated to tackle the problem of proxy attendance and other malpractices. The Decentralized Application interacts with the smart contract written on the Ethereum network. The smart contract created involves in storing the details of the student’s education timeline, such as his/ her marks, institution information, etc. Cloud technology has been used to store large files which cannot be stored in the smart contracts. Many natural calamities and other causes have led to the destruction of the stored details in the traditional databases, these problems have been overcome with this use of Cloud technology, where it provides features like replicability to avoid loses, reliability to avoid failures, scalability to avoid shortage of resources, etc. Authentication has been addressed with the help of face recognition tool which detects the identity of a person.

Consequently, phishing scam detection is particularly critical for Ethereum to avoid economic loss. However, accounts on Ethereum are represented as strings without features, which brings great difficulties for detection. To combat this challenge, we propose an effective method based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with Conditional Random Field (CRF) to detect phishing scams. Firstly, we process accounts and their neighbors with transaction records to build transaction graphs. Due to lack of portrait information, we adopt DeepWalk to provide initial features for each node. Then graph representations are learned through GCN with CRF.

In this article, we present Pistis, a framework for issuing authorized and trusted certificates with the distributed ledger and Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) technology. In Pistis, TEE nodes validate whether the domain in a requested certificate passes the domain ownership validation (i.e., under corresponding applicants’ control) and submit attested results to a smart contract in the distributed ledger. The smart contract issues a certificate to the applicant when an attested result shows a pass. Therefore, Pistis can ensure its issued certificates are authorized due to the domain ownership validation mechanism in the TEE. Furthermore, as the issued certificates are stored in a Merkle Patricia Tree (MPT) in Pistis, they are trusted and can be verified by a normal user easily. The security of Pistis is formally proved in the Universally Composable (UC) framework.

Specifically, we first identify 12 gas-expensive patterns in smart contracts and classify them into three categories: storage-related, judgment-related, and loop-related. Then, we deploy gas-expensive patterns and group them into three levels according to gas waste degree. By conducting extensive experiments on real data sets, we find that 89.68% of the 1172 smart contracts suffer from gas-expensive patterns, 94.27% of 1100 new smart contracts are gas-expensive, and 80.56% of 72 widely used smart contracts are affected. Finally, the experiment results show that the proposed GaSaver can effectively optimize smart contracts. Besides, the proportion of gas-expensive cases in widely used smart contracts is lower than that in the newly released smart contracts.","2377-3782","","10.1109/TSUSC.2022.3221444","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9946440","Code optimization;gas-expensive pattern;smart contract;solidity;static analysis","Source coding;Smart contracts;Blockchains;Codes;Optimization;Costs;Estimation","","","","","","","IEEE","11 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

These ride-hailing services (RHS) bring convenience to our life; however, at the same time they, also raise security concerns for users. For example, several recent news items show that a considerable number of registered drivers whose licenses have been revoked are still taking RHS orders on the respective platforms; this phenomenon directly leads to insecurity on part of its users and the bad reputation of the ride-hailing service provider (SP). The traditional solution to solve this problem is to periodically check the validity of the drivers’ licenses; however, it is a considerably time-consuming and costly process since the SPs have to manually interact with the governing authorities. Therefore, in this paper, we have presented an auditable self-sovereign identity system (named AudiSSI), which provides an efficient approach for the SPs to manage their registered drivers’ qualifications in a decentralized and automatic manner. Further, using smart contract technology, we propose a safety guarantee insurance in the form of an auditing contract to enable the RHS rider to check their driver's qualifications before the trip starts and get incentives once they detect a disqualified driver. We designed an incentive mechanism and have provided a game theoretical analysis. Finally, we implemented a prototype of AudiSSI and deployed it on Hyperledger Indy and Fabric to show that self-sovereign identity system for RHS driver with qualification auditing is efficient and technically feasible.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2021.3108012","Blockchain Core Technology Strategic Research Program of Ministry of Education(grant numbers:2020KJ010801); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9524519","Auditing;blockchain;smart contract;ride-hailing;game theory;insurance scheme;decentralized system","Vehicles;Distributed ledger;Licenses;Security;Insurance;Safety;Mobile computing","blockchains;contracts;data analysis;financial data processing;game theory;incentive schemes;insurance;security of data;transportation","AudiSSI;auditing contract;automated incentives;disqualified driver;disqualified drivers auditing;drivers qualifications;Hyperledger Indy;private ride-hailing companies;qualification auditing;registered drivers;RHS driver;RHS orders;RHS rider;ride-hailing service provider;safety guarantee insurance;safety warning;self-sovereign identity system;smart contract technology;Uber","","3","","44","IEEE","27 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Given the risks related to data security and many others to the technologies involved, it is essential today to have specific protection, particularly for authentication, access control, authorization, secure transfer, traceability, etc. To this end, this project aims to provide secure and intrusion-tolerant intelligent infrastructure and platform, combining the aforementioned technologies to assist and facilitate the daily and professional lives of human beings, respecting their privacy and guaranteeing the security of data and transactions. This research project aims more specifically at cybersecurity based on deep learning through the speech recognition system on the one hand. On the other hand, the ultimate goal is to detect anomalies in the behavior of users once accessing the system. The blockchain will be used to ensure the authentication and identification processes, to deploy the security policy with the smart contract, and also to take care of the generation of the keys necessary for the encryption. The authentication and identification process is done through a combination of voice recognition and user credentials (attributes), using deep learning to extract features and then comparing the template generated with those stored in the blockchain. In addition, our objective is to optimize the voice recognition algorithms. The optimization of such a system requires performance optimization of the platform (i.e., maximization) and risk reduction (i.e., minimization).","","979-8-3503-4671-8","10.1109/SDS57574.2022.10062921","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10062921","Biometrics;Blockchain;Speech recognition;Deep learning;Access control","Deep learning;Privacy;Biometrics (access control);Data security;Smart contracts;Authentication;Speech recognition","authorisation;biometrics (access control);blockchains;computer network security;data privacy;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;speech recognition","anomaly detection;authentication;authorization;biometric access control systems;biometric data;blockchain technology;centralized environment;cybersecurity;data security;deep learning-based automatic speech recognition;deep learning-based speech recognition system;identification process;information leakage;intrusion-tolerant intelligent infrastructure;platform optimization;risk reduction;secure intelligent infrastructure;secure transfer;security policy deployment;smart contract;specific protection;speech recognition system;user credentials;voice recognition algorithms","","","","6","IEEE","17 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When health records are stored in a single system, data breaches might occur. A data breach will cost healthcare organizations $ 380 per record, according to estimates. Incidents reported to the federal government in 2021 resulted in the compromising of more than 40 million medical records this year. As a result, we switched to a record-keeping center, Which has not made a great deal of a difference. Because the patient has no control over the data, there is a high chance of it being mishandled. As a result, we require a patient-centered strategy that is entirely decentralized, capable of detecting data theft, preventing data tampering, and granting patients access control. Blockchain technology is the most effective way to solve all problems and meet all needs. As a decentralized and distributed ledger, blockchain has the potential to impact billing, medical research, identity theft, record sharing, and data crimes in the future. In the department of health, Smart contracts help to clarify things more particularly. On the Blockchain, invocation, record creation, and validation will all take place. This article mainly focuses on the maintenance of the patients-focused architecture of health records with the use of blockchain, so here smart contracts can be used to modify or be newly added in the future to increase data interchange potential.","","978-1-6654-9761-9","10.1109/ICSSS54381.2022.9782228","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9782228","Health record management system;Blockchain;Data breaches;Decentralization;Authentication","Smart contracts;Government;Memory;Medical services;Switches;Data breach;Maintenance engineering","blockchains;electronic data interchange;health care;medical information systems;records management","record-keeping center;patient-centered strategy;data theft;Blockchain technology;record sharing;data crimes;record creation;health records;data interchange potential;health record management;human health;data breach;patients access control;distributed ledger;decentralized ledger;patients-focused architecture","","","","9","IEEE","1 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first integration of ROS 2 with the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. With a framework that leverages Fabric smart contracts and ROS 2 through a Go application, we delve into the potential of using blockchain for controlling robots, and gathering and processing their data. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework to an inventory management use-case where different robots are used to detect objects of interest in a given area. Designed to meet the requirements of distributed robotic systems, we show that the performance of the robots is not impacted significantly by the blockchain layer. At the same time, we provide examples for developing other applications that integrate Fabric smart contracts with ROS 2.

However, privacy and security problems remain largely unresolved in the safety area. Various rule-based methods have been considered to recognize aberrant behaviors in IoMT and have demonstrated high accuracy of misbehavior detection appropriate for lightweight IoT devices. However, most of these solutions have privacy concerns, especially when giving context during misbehavior analysis. Moreover, falsified or modified context generates a high percentage of false positives and sometimes causes a by-pass in misbehavior detection. Relying on the recent powerful consolidation of blockchain and federated learning (FL), we propose an efficient privacy-preserving framework for secure misbehavior detection in lightweight IoMT devices, particularly in the artificial pancreas system (APS). The proposed approach employs privacy-preserving bidirectional long-short term memory (BiLSTM) and augments the security through integrating blockchain technology based on Ethereum smart contract environment. The effectiveness of the proposed model is bench-marked empirically in terms of sustainable privacy preservation, commensurate incentive scheme with an untraceability feature, exhaustiveness, and the compact results of a variant neural network approach. As a result, the proposed model has a 99.93% recall rate, showing that it can detect virtually all possible malicious events in the targeted use case.

So we present a blockchain-based multi-layer data security sharing model (ML-DSM). The model not only combines blockchain and attribute-based access control technology, but also introduces malicious access behavior judgment and user rating mechanism. Judging malicious access behavior helps detect malicious users in time at the early stage of access control, and effectively prevents malicious attacks such as DoS. In the user rating mechanism, the smart contract evaluates the user's reputation level based on the user's current and historical reputation scores and judges whether the reputation level is higher than the level of the requested data. The rating mechanism not only dynamically adjusts the access rights of the requestor but also effectively reduces the average judgment time of access control. The final experimental analysis results show that the data sharing model in this paper can improve the execution efficiency of access control while ensuring the security of the shared data. Thus ML-DSM achieves more secure and efficient data sharing.","2833-8898","979-8-3503-3154-7","10.1109/CyberC55534.2022.00020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10090209","blockchain;smart contract;data sharing;attribute-based access control;reputation level","Access control;Data security;Computational modeling;Smart contracts;Permission;Knowledge discovery;Data models","authorisation;Big Data;blockchains;computer network security;contracts;data privacy;security of data","access control technology;big data;blockchain-based multilayer data security sharing model;malicious access behavior judgment;opaque data;requested data;secure data sharing;shared data;traditional data sharing model;user rating mechanism","","","","23","IEEE","5 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The repositioning of refurbished devices into the market, however, is accompanied by a number of challenges, including concerns about quality and safety, as well as the risk of fraudulent activities such as counterfeiting. To address these challenges, we propose an NFT-based solution for managing refurbished medical devices that creates a secure, transparent, and verifiable record of the refurbishment process to ensure the safety and quality of these devices. The proposed solution utilizes dynamic composable NFTs as digital representations of medical devices, with replacement parts and certificate documents embedded in a parent-child NFT hierarchy, and reprocessing steps captured and reflected through the evolution of the dynamic tokens. This serves to authenticate and track the movement of refurbished devices while also providing a trustworthy means of managing individual devices and their ownership. Furthermore, the integration of non-transferable NFTs as certificates of refurbishment acts as an effective mechanism for detecting suspect medical devices and instances of fraudulent labeling, thereby increasing buyer confidence and promoting user safety. We leverage the Interplanetary File System to store and keep track of the metadata of the tokenized components of the system. We present the system architecture and implementation details with tested algorithms. We develop a front-end decentralized application (DApp) to interact with the designed smart contracts and showcase their functionalities.

A system model is presented to explain architecture, and overall functionality of FLAME using blockchain. Further, a sensing network and connectivity model is proposed to detect true fire and send an emergency service request to monitoring station. Smart contracts are designed to automate fire brigade service and insurance claim processes. A prototype of the FLAME is implemented on Hyperledger Besu blockchain using Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerance 2.0 consensus protocol.

This work makes the first attempt for detecting arbitrage on Ethereum through feature fusion and positive-unlabeled learning (PU learning). We first conduct an in-depth analysis and exploit two-fold arbitrage features by fusion including: 1) statistical features that explicitly represent the node activity levels according to expert knowledge; and 2) structural features that implicitly encode the transactions information by graph machine learning. We then apply PU learning to generate negative instances for compensating the imbalanced arbitrage datasets.

In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based decentralized FL system. The FL process in the proposed system is composed of two stages. In the first stage, FL nodes reach a consensus on the training configurations using smart contracts. In the second stage, nodes aggregate the model updates using a novel decentralized aggregation method. The proposed system efficiently schedules aggregation tasks between decentralized nodes, handles dropouts, and detects malicious acts.

However, this has lead to many security concerns, and one of the most important ones is ensuring data integrity. Public verification schemes are able to employ a third party auditor to perform data auditing on behalf of the user. But most public verification schemes are vulnerable to procrastinating auditors who may not perform auditing on time. These schemes do not have fair arbitration also, i.e. they lack a way to punish the malicious Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and compensate user whose data has been corrupted. On the other hand, CSP might be storing redundant data that could increase the storage cost for the CSP and computational cost of data auditing for the user. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-based public auditing and deduplication scheme with a fair arbitration system against procrastinating auditors. The key idea requires auditors to record each verification using smart contract and store the result into a Blockchain as a transaction. Our scheme can detect and punish the procrastinating auditors and compensate users in the case of any data loss. Additionally, our scheme can detect and delete duplicate data that improve storage utilization and reduce the computational cost of data verification. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our scheme is provably secure and does not incur overhead compared to the existing public auditing techniques while offering an additional feature of verifying the auditor’s performance.","2693-8928","978-1-6654-8066-6","10.1109/CSCloud-EdgeCom54986.2022.00022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9843044","Convergent Encryption;Confidentiality;Deduplication;Blockchain;Public Data Auditing;Procrastinating Auditor","Cloud computing;Costs;Data integrity;Conferences;Smart contracts;Computational efficiency;Blockchains","auditing;cloud computing;data integrity;security of data;storage management","cloud storage services;storage cost;security concerns;important ones;public verification schemes;party auditor;procrastinating auditors;malicious Cloud Service Provider;CSP;redundant data;deduplication scheme;fair arbitration system;smart contract;data loss;duplicate data;storage utilization;data verification;existing public auditing techniques;Cloud ensuring data integrity","","","","19","IEEE","4 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For this reason, the Security Research Group has been hard at work creating various detection methods to lessen the blow of any future cyberattacks. Cloud computing, often known as internet computing, is a model of delivering computing as a service, in which shared, elastically scalable and virtually hosted servers are made available to users anywhere there is an internet connection. Numerous companies provide cloud services online to meet the needs of various clientele. Since most cloud users lack their own computing capabilities, they must save their data, documents, and applications in the cloud in order to perform their work efficiently. The focus of this work is on the worldwide identification procedure utilising a digital passport in the cloud. There has been and will continue to be significant growth in cloud-based innovation and advancement in the coming years. Users can benefit greatly from cloud computing by delegating complex activities to remote data centers. Whether or not consumers can access the cloud’s services is determined by the terms of the Service Level Agreement (SLA) in place between the cloud’s suppliers and the users. By detecting when a service level agreement (SLA) has been broken, cloud service providers may boost customer confidence, decrease the likelihood of incurring costly fines, and boost their bottom line. This study makes two significant contributions to the fields of service provider selection for virtual machine (VM) migrations and SLA (service level agreement) violation detection in public cloud computing. The pros and cons of a passport-free international travel system were examined. This study has compared various research methodologies and frameworks for implementing new technologies.

In contrast, this paper proposes a detection mechanism called Ethereum Phishing Scam Detection (Eth-PSD) that attempts to detect phishing scam-related transactions using a novel machine learning-based approach. Eth-PSD tackles some of the limitations in the existing works, such as the use of imbalanced datasets, complex feature engineering, and lower detection accuracy. We also investigated the aspects of constructing a new updated, balanced dataset that can be used to evaluate Eth-PSD effectively. Our experimental results indicate that Eth-PSD could efficiently detect the phishing scam on Ethereum with a detection accuracy of 98.11%, with a very low False Positive Rate of 0.01. Taken together, Eth-PSD showed a superior advantage compared to the existing works in reducing the dimensionality of the dataset by feature engineering and achieved an overall detection accuracy with an improvement of at least 6% compared to other existing solutions from the related work.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3220780","Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia’s Fundamental Research Grant Scheme(grant numbers:FRGS/1/2021/ICT07/USM/03/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9943287","Blockchain;Ethereum;feature engineering;intrusion detection system;machine learning;phishing scam","Phishing;Blockchains;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Intrusion detection;Security;Correlation","blockchains;computer crime;contracts;learning (artificial intelligence)","blockchain-based attacks;complex feature engineering;cybercriminal attention;Eth-PSD;Ethereum phishing scam detection;financial field;machine learning-based phishing scam detection approach;phishing scam accounts;phishing scam-related transactions;scam wallets;smart contracts","","2","","41","CCBY","9 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Power utilities lose revenue and battle to sustain power reliability standards. When the supply of power is not provided in agreement with the contract, power companies suffer penalties from their customers. In the past, electric companies used a “trouble call system” to detect outages, whereby consumers experiencing power outages would phone in and report them. The power utility would dispatch the field crew to restore power. Due to this method, customers will be out of supply for a long period oftime. As a result, using the IEC 61850 GOOSE message application, this study developed a relay control technique to emulate the automatic reconfiguration of the distribution system under fault conditions.

An adversary can launch poisoning attacks by tampering with patients’ medical data, which will lead to misdiagnosis of the patients’ conditions. Lots of studies have been conducted to defend against poisoning attacks based on blockchain or hardware. However, 1) Blockchain-based schemes can only exploit on-chain data to deal with poisoning attacks due to the lack of off-chain trusted entities. 2) Typical hardware-based schemes have the bottleneck of single point of failure. To overcome these defects, we propose a defense scheme via multiple Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) and blockchain oracle. Benefitting from multiple TPMs verification results, a distributed blockchain oracle is proposed to obtain off-chain verification results for smart contracts. Then, the smart contracts could utilize the off-chain verification result to identify poisoning attacks and store the unique identifiers of the non-threatening IoT device immutably on the blockchain as a whitelist of federated learning participants. Finally, we analyze the security features and evaluate the performance of our scheme, which shows the robustness and efficiency of the proposed work.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-8347-7","10.1109/ICC45855.2022.9838252","Research and Development; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9838252","Internet of Things (IoT);Digital healthcare;Federated Learning;Blockchain Oracle;Trusted Platform Module","Training;Performance evaluation;Smart contracts;Collaborative work;Hardware;Robustness;Blockchains","blockchains;computer crime;health care;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;patient monitoring;trusted computing","data poisoning attack;trusted platform module;Internet of Things;IoT system;remote health monitoring;TPM;distributed blockchain oracle;off-chain verification;patient biological index;medical data tampering;federated learning","","","","26","IEEE","11 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this research, we propose a new framework to detect malicious and suspicious Ethereum accounts using 3 different data sources (honeypot, Internet-wide scanner and blockchain explorer). The honeypot, named Etherpot, utilizes a proxy server placed between a real Ethereum client and the Internet. It modifies responses from the Ethereum client to attract attackers, identifies malicious accounts and analyzes their behaviors. With the Internet-wide scan results from Shodan, we also detect suspicious Ethereum accounts that are registered on multiple nodes. Finally, we utilize Etherscan, a well-known blockchain explorer for Ethereum, to track and analyze the activities related to the detected accounts. Through the observation of 6 weeks, we observed 538 hosts trying to call JSON- RPC of our honeypots with 41 different types of methods, including 2 types of unreported attacks in the wild. We detected 16 malicious accounts from the honeypots and 64 suspicious accounts from Shodan scan results, 5 out of which are overlapped.

Unfortunately, most of the corresponding schemes rely on trusted institutions such as the centralized third-party auditor (TPA) and the cloud service organizer, and it is difficult to identify malicious service providers after service disputes. Therefore, we present a blockchain-based multi-cloud storage data auditing scheme to protect data integrity and accurately arbitrate service disputes. We not only introduce the blockchain to record the interactions among users, service providers, and organizers in data auditing process as evidence, but also employ the smart contract to detect service dispute, so as to enforce the untrusted organizer to honestly identify malicious service providers.

However, SDN has a draw-back: there is a security problem of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks at the control layer. This paper proposes an effective solution: DDoS detection within the domain using tri-entropy in information theory. The detected attacks are then uploaded to a smart contract in the blockchain, so that the attacks can be quickly cut off even if the same attack occurs in different domains.

The mainstream traditional copyright protection schemes need an authority online all the time to handle copyright issues and face some problems such as intricate copyright transfer, single point of failure and so on. To alleviate the burden of the authority, a few blockchain-based copyright protection schemes are proposed. However, most of them do not consider copyright transfer, and their infringement penalty may only happen after copyright owners discover the infringement behavior (i.e., “ex-post penalty”). In this article, we propose a new security strategy, called “Proactive Defense” in copyright protection which can prevent infringement before it occurs. With our proposed proactive defense strategy, we design a secure copyright protection scheme which provides advantages of compact copyright transfer and prior infringement penalty. More concrete, both copyright registration and transfer are regarded as transactions and recorded to the blockchain. Based on the double-authentication-prevention signature and non-interactive zero-knowledge proof techniques, illegal copyright transfer can be detected and the infringement penalty can be done automatically with a tailored smart contract before the completion of the transfer. Our security analysis shows that the proposed scheme can achieve all desirable security properties. Moreover, we implement our scheme in Java and evaluate the performance experimentally. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme has good security and efficiency, which can be applied for the copyright protection.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2023.3246476","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10050765","Copyright protection;double-authentication-preventing signature;blockchain","Copyright protection;Security;Blockchains;Watermarking;Smart contracts;Faces;Behavioral sciences","","","","","","","IEEE","23 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Physical therapy (using muscle stimulators), occupational therapy and nerve transfer surgery are all viable therapies for paralysis. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation is a technique for causing paretic muscles to contract using an electrical current that can efficiently produce muscle contractions which are used on paralyzed patients. Electromyograms are used to evaluate the electrical activity in response to nerve stimulation of the muscle. EMG data can be used to examine the disorders of nerve, muscles and communication between them.

Thus, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) must evolve to cope with these increasingly sophisticated and challenging security threats. Traditional IDSs are prone to zero-day attacks since they are usually signature-based detection systems. The recent advent of machine learning and deep learning (ML/DL) techniques can help strengthen these IDSs. However, the lack of up-to-date labeled training datasets makes these ML/DL based IDSs inefficient. The privacy nature of these datasets and widespread emergence of adversarial attacks make it difficult for major organizations to share their sensitive data. Federated Learning (FL) is gaining momentum from both academia and industry as a new sub-field of ML that aims to train a global statistical model across multiple distributed users, referred to as collaborators, without sharing their private data. Due to its privacy-preserving nature, FL has the potential to enable privacy-aware learning between a large number of collaborators. This paper presents a novel framework, called MiTFed, that allows multiple software defined networks (SDN) domains ($i.e.,$ collaborators) to collaboratively build a global intrusion detection model without sharing their sensitive datasets. In particular, MiTFed consists of: (1) a novel distributed architecture that allows multiple SDN based domains to securely collaborate in order to cope with sophisticated security threats while preserving the privacy of each SDN domain; (2) a novel Secure Multiparty Computation (SMPC) scheme to securely aggregate local model updates; and (3) a blockchain based scheme that uses Ethereum smart contracts to maintain the collaboration in a fully decentralized, trustworthy, flexible, and efficient manner. To the best of our knowledge, MiTFed is the first framework that leverages FL, blockchain and SDN technologies to mitigate the new emerging security threats in large scale. To evaluate MiTFed, we conduct several experiments using real-world network attacks; the experimental results using the well-known public network security dataset NSL-KDD show that MiTFed achieves efficiency and high accuracy in detecting the new emerging security threats in both binary and multi-class classification while preserving the privacy of collaborators, making it a promising framework to cope with the new emerging security threats in SDN.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2023.3237367","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10018276","DDoS;IDS;Federated Learning;SDN;Blockchain;SMPC;Smart contracts","Blockchains;Collaboration;Intrusion detection;Feature extraction;Data models;Data privacy;Federated learning","","","","","","","IEEE","16 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To demonstrate the application of ${\sf BlockExplorer}$, we develop three apps upon ${\sf BlockExplorer}$ to detect real-life attacks against Ethereum and show that our apps can detect attacks in a large range of blocks (e.g., ten million) within a short time (e.g., multiple hours).","1557-9956","","10.1109/TC.2023.3248280","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFB3104500); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972073,61872057,U19A2066); Key Research Funds of Sichuan Province(grant numbers:2021YFG0167,2020YFG0298); Sichuan Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:2020JDTD0007); Fundamental Research Funds for Chinese Central Universities(grant numbers:ZYGX2020ZB027,ZYGX2021J018); Natural Science Foundation of Sichuan Province(grant numbers:2022NSFSC0871); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10050734","Security and privacy;Ethereum;distributed system;blockchain","Big Data;Smart contracts;Blockchains;Runtime;Synchronization;Security;Main-secondary","","","","","","","IEEE","23 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In ITS, the IoVs communicate wirelessly with other IoVs, Road Side Unit (RSU) and Cloud Server using an open channel Internet. The openness of above participating entities and their communication technologies brings challenges such as security vulnerabilities, data privacy, transparency, verifiability, scalability, and data integrity among participating entities. To address these challenges, we present a Privacy-Preserving based Secured Framework for Internet of Vehicles (P2SF-IoV). P2SF-IoV integrates blockchain and deep learning technique to overcome aforementioned challenges, and works on two modules. First, a blockchain module is developed to securely transmit the data between IoV-RSU-Cloud. Second, a deep learning module is designed that uses the data from blockchain module to detect intrusion and its performance is assessed using two network datasets IoT-Botnet and ToN-IoT. In contrast with other peer privacy-preserving intrusion detection strategies, the P2SF-IoV approach is compared, and the experimental results reveal that in both blockchain and non-blockchain based solutions, the proposed P2SF-IoV framework outperforms.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2021.3102581","Ph.D. Scholarship through the Ministry of Education, India; CPDS Grant through NIT Raipur, India; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9511849","Blockchain;deep learning;Internet of Vehicles (IoV);intrusion detection system (IDS);privacy-preservation","Blockchains;Security;Smart contracts;Deep learning;Intrusion detection;Computer architecture;Privacy","cloud computing;computer network security;cryptographic protocols;data privacy;Internet;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security","blockchain module;data integrity;data privacy;deep learning module;IoV-RSU-Cloud;manual vehicles;nonblockchain based solutions;open channel Internet;P2SF-IoV approach;P2SF-IoV framework;participating entities;peer privacy-preserving intrusion detection strategies;Privacy-preservation-based Secured Framework;Privacy-Preserving based Secured Framework;security vulnerabilities","","19","","32","IEEE","11 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For the use-case implementation, the pandemic caused by the wide and rapid spread of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 was used to test and evaluate the proposed system. Recently, various authors traced the spread of viruses in sewage water and studied how it can be used as a tracking system. Early warning notifications can allow governments and organizations to take appropriate actions at the earliest stages possible. The system was validated experimentally using 14 Raspberry Pis, and the results and analyses proved that the system is able to utilize low-cost and low-power flexible IoT hardware at the processing layer to detect COVID-19 and predict its spread using the AI engine, with an accuracy of 95%, and share the outcome over the blockchain platform. This is accomplished when the platform is secured by the honesty-based distributed proof of authority (HDPoA) and without any substantial impact on the devices’ power sources, as there was only a power consumption increase of 7% when the Raspberry Pi was used for blockchain mining and 14% when used to produce an AI prediction.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3151370","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9713867","Edge computing;blockchain protocol;the Internet of Things (IoT);flexible IoT hardware;artificial intelligence (AI);coronavirus disease (COVID-19)","Blockchains;Internet of Things;Artificial intelligence;Security;Computer architecture;Smart contracts;Edge computing","artificial intelligence;blockchains;cloud computing;data mining;diseases;epidemics;Internet of Things;microcomputers;protocols","coronavirus COVID-19;sewage water;tracking system;blockchain mining;secure blockchain platform;AI-enabled IoT applications;edge layer;blockchain protocol;edge computing;artificial intelligence;IoT end-devices;AI-expert engine;public blockchain platform;use-case implementation;early warning notifications;low-power flexible IoT hardware;honesty-based distributed proof of authority;HDPoA;Raspberry Pi","","8","","30","CCBY","14 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) has recently emerged as a new security model in which the breach mindset dominates the threat model. By default, the ZTA considers any endpoint (i.e., device), user, or application to be untrusted until proven otherwise. Nonetheless, once proven by the endpoint, using Advanced Persistent Threats (APT), attackers can still take over an authenticated and authorised session via that endpoint. Therefore, they can perform several user/device centric malicious activities in addition to lateral movement rendering the endpoint the Achilles heel of ZTA. To effectively deter APT attack capabilities on the endpoints, this work proposes a Blockchain-enabled Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (BIDPS) that augments ZTA onto endpoints. The BIDPS aims to achieve two core outcomes: first, detect and prevent attackers’ techniques and tactics as per MITRE’s ATT&CK enterprise matrix earlier than the lateral movement stage, and secondly, strip trust out of the endpoint itself and place it on-chain, thus creating an immutable system of explicit trust. To evaluate the effectiveness of the BIDPS, a testbed was built where techniques of over ten APTs attacks were launched against the endpoint. BIDPS has a high rate of success defending against the launched attacks owing to its Blockchain’s immutability, fortifying the detection/prevention processes.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3200165","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9862967","Advanced persistent threats;blockchain;endpoints;intrusion detection;intrusion prevention;security;MITRE’s ATT&CK;zero trust","Blockchains;Monitoring;Peer-to-peer computing;Distributed ledger;Smart contracts;Intrusion detection;Computer architecture;Security","authorisation;blockchains;computer crime","BIDPS;zero trust architecture;ZTA;security model;threat model;APTs attacks;blockchain-enabled intrusion detection and prevention system;bring your own device;BYOD;remote working;advanced persistent threat;authenticated session;authorised session;lateral movement rendering;Achilles heel;enterprise matrix","","2","","79","CCBY","18 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Lower temperatures and steadier air in winter exacerbate the impact of rice stubble burning. However, research on using machine learning with blockchain to address this problem is limited. This study aims to provide a conceptual framework for using machine learning and blockchain to prevent and detect stubble burning. With the help of machine learning and satellite images, areas originating the pollution can be identified. This can be done with pre-processed images sent to pre-trained models to identify the place of origin of the pollution. If the pollution crosses a threshold limit, then the location will be stored in the blockchain.

Chromaprint, an open-source audio fingerprint program, generates a hash value to detect copyright infringement. To assess the perceptual hash technique’s robustness, Chromaprint generates a hash value from an audio file that can be modified with several signal processing attacks.

A blockchain-based fake news detection can better handle such problems. The proposed classification algorithm is used to detect fake news in training and testing evolution. Another major objective of this work is to revoke the attackers who update the published news. The blockchain-based decentralized peer-to-peer environment has been used to protect the published data even in a vulnerable environment Various features extraction and selection techniques have been used to generate effective training rules and validate the test classifier accordingly. An extensive experimental analysis demonstrates the classification accuracy of fake news detection on the LIAR dataset.

The softwarized UAV enable ubiquitous connection, as well as a flexible, cost-effective, and improved method for upgrading all network services without shutting down the entire system. However, the connectivity of UAVs with OpenFlow switches and their heavy reliance on unsecured communication protocols makes the entire network vulnerable. This is a critical concern, particularly in combat surveillance, where eavesdropping, adding, changing, or deleting messages during communications between deployed UAVs and SDN controller is a possible threat. To mitigate the aforementioned issues, this paper presents a novel secure data sharing framework for softwarized UAV environments that incorporates blockchain and Deep Learning (DL). First we present a blockchain-based technique to reg-ister, verify and thereafter validate the communication entities in softwarized UAV environment using smart contract-based Proof-of-Authentication (PoA) consensus mechanism. Additionally, a new deep neural network architecture-based flow analyzer is designed to detect illegitimate transactions. The latter combines a Stacked Contractive Sparse AutoEncoder with Attention-based Long Short-term Memory Neural Network (SCSAE-ALSTM) to improve intrusion detection process.

To our knowledge, there was no serious attempt yet to overcome the SGX protection by exploiting the weaknesses in the software supply chain infrastructure, namely at the level of the development, build or signing servers. While SGX protection does not specifically take into consideration such threats, we show in the current article that a simple malware attack exploiting a separation between the build and signing processes can have a serious damaging impact, practically nullifying SGX integrity protection measures. We also explore two possible mitigations against the attack, one centralized leveraging SGX itself, and one distributed that relies on a smart contract deployed on a blockchain infrastructure.

Therefore, the detection and quantification of account risk are of great importance for both cryptocurrency investors and blockchain security researchers. In this article, we propose the first general framework for account risk rating on Ethereum, which includes a devisable suspiciousness metric to adapt to various illicit fraud detection and a network propagation mechanism to formulate the relations between accounts and transactions. By conducting extensive experiments on a real-world dataset from Ethereum, we show the universality of the account risk rating framework. Particularly, statistical analyses on different risk levels of accounts demonstrate that the risk rating framework has access to detect various illicit accounts. And the metric analysis of risk rating results put forward some insights. Moreover, visualization of a suspicious transaction chain reveals the process of illicit activities on Ethereum, enabling investors to obtain an understanding of the risky accounts and avoid significant financial losses.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2023.3263382","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61973325); Natural Science Foundations of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2023A15150113114,2021A1515011661); Technology Program of Guangzhou, China(grant numbers:202103050004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10097741","Blockchain;Ethereum;general framework;network propagation;risk rating","Blockchains;Measurement;Fraud;Cryptocurrency;Task analysis;Feature extraction;Biological system modeling","","","","","","","IEEE","10 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"
